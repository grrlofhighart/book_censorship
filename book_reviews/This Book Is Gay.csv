I gave it two stars because I don't consider this book to be very inclusive, especially when it comes to non-binary people and/or those who are not gay or lesbian (i.e. bi or pan or ace or ...).So please refrain from commenting when all you intend to do is to suggest I read queerantagonistic books. Don't like this review. I'm not on your side, I don't agree with you and I honestly don't need your prejudices in my life.What I liked.It's an uplifting book. One message repeated over and over again is: ""Whoever you are, that's fine!"" Plus, there are lots of sections especially young people might find very useful - coming out, who to tell, how to tell, sex, STIs ... So, thumbs up for that.The BUT. It's a very big one.You're fine with that book if you're a gay boy/man. You got Grindr explained and are directly addressed throughout the whole book.If you're a lesbian girl/woman, it's ... okay. You won't get to know what the lesbian equivalent of Grindr is and mind you, dental dams are more important than Juno Dawson makes them seem to be, but otherwise it's okay. I guess.Any other identities ... well, you get the definitions for ""bisexual"", ""queer"", ""curious"", ""asexual"" and ""transgender"", but the one for bisexuality is extremely narrow and excludes most bisexual people, and if you're hoping for the acknowledgement of non-binary genders, you got the wrong book. Generally, the author often refers to differences as ""gay or straight"" (though not always) and lists any issues any sexual orientations other than homosexuality face as homophobia.Maybe Dawson wanted to simplify things. Maybe, but it doesn't make it right. And it doesn't explain this constant use of ""men and women"".What is particularly confusing is that there seem to be moments of light. E.g. after repeatedly implying that gender = genitals, it is mentioned that there is more to men than just penises or that not having any surgeries is fine ... only to continue as before. What irks me the most about it is that stuff like this is toxic. It's telling people: You're either a boy or a girl and if you want to ""become"" the ""opposite"" gender, then you need a penis or a vagina. Mentioning that this isn't actually true once or twice doesn't erase what has been spread before.Another passage is also rather telling. On page 214 it says:However, all people - gay or otherwise - must recognize that there is one universal truth of the universe:WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE.Apparently, mentioning and defining asexuality at the beginning is enough and you don't have to acknowledge them again.So what now?The title is actually quite telling. This book is gay - and binary. And parts of it are great! But seeing that it even spreads misinformation when it comes to genders and some sexualities ... well, I can't recommend that.People have been asking for alternative titles you might read instead. I haven't read it yet myself, but The ABCs of LGBT+ has been recommended in the comments and it does sound great.Show more"

I'd still recommend it for cis gay boys, because I think there's a lot of great information there, and therefore, I'll give it two stars rather than one. But make no mistake - this book is for them. I don't know why the entirety of the spectrum is claimed to be covered in this book, because it isn't with anywhere near the type of depth, accuracy, or effort made for the others. It's ragingly binary, the information on different definitions under the trans umbrella includes things that are offensive and/or wrong; asexuality is barely touched upon and pretty patently ignored after its first mention (and also doesn't address anything on the spectrum, nor discuss (a)romanticism by name, though it is indeed stated that one can be in a romantic relationship while asexual, at least); and there is literally one cited expert on girl-on-girl sex, whose discussion can be boiled down to ""There's only fingering and oral, and I don't like oral."" There's also an incredibly shallow discussion on how to fight with people of different religions that literally put Judaism as a subset under the header of Islam, and then blamed Orthodox Jews for starting homophobia because Leviticus. (If you know me, you might have an idea why that'd rankle a bit on eleventy levels. If not, hi, I'm a really, really pro-LGBTQ Orthodox Jew who does indeed keep the laws of Leviticus mocked in this book.) So, yeah, I'd recommend this for cis gay boys with a massive grain of salt, hoping they seek info on the rest of the queer spectrum elsewhere.Show more"

But I couldn’t get through a single page of it without wrinkling my nose at all the blatant transphobia from a book that claimed to speak for me. I started being wary on page two, with the whole “some men want to be women"" thing. Trans people don’t want to be another gender, they are, plain and simple. Imagine if I wrote gay men want to love boys. That looks absolutely ridiculous and homophobic; gay men do love boys. And trans people are they say they are. It gets way worse from there. I recall in the stereotypes section he said something akin to “of course gay men aren’t girls, they have penises!”. The basis of transphobic rhetoric, men are men because they have penises and women are women because of their vaginas: right in plain sight. Additionally, sexuality is only discussed in an attracted to men/attracted to women binary. The undertones of non binary people being unlovable is certainly there. I cannot explain how upset it makes me that other young trans people will this and think that they can never truly be their gender because this author, someone supposedly teaching them, is just spewing the same transphobic garbage they’ve heard all their life under the guise of fighting homophobia. And all the cisgender people who are giving this book full stars, thinking that he is representing the trans community perfectly. Sorry if this seems a little rude, I’m just tired of seeing such blatant transphobia perpetrated by people in the LGBT community. This book is the guide to being a cisgender gay man who sweeps everyone else under the rug. It is dangerous to have this information out there with mostly positive reviews when it is perpetrating systematic transphobia. Show more"

It mostly focuses on cisgender gay men and their problems, and often throws trans people under the bus to make a sassy statement. Like, there are several times when the author says ""lesbians love vaginas!,"" which completely ignores the fact that not all women have vaginas, and not everyone with a vagina is a woman. And later, in the advice for trans people, the author says that ""people don't fall in love with genitalia,"" but she seems to not understand why it would be transphobic for her to equate body parts to gender identity.I also didn't like how in the safe sex section, she literally just says ""lesbians have a low risk of getting STIs"" and that's her whole section on safe sex between two people with vaginas.I also didn't like how in the religion section, it pretty much blames Jews for there being religious homophobia in the first place, and for some reason puts Judaism as a subcategory in the Muslim section (???????????????) and doesn't mention at all how many Jews are supportive of LGBTQ people (hint: it's a lot).Overall, I think I would MAYBE give this book to a cisgender gay boy to read, but only after heavily enforcing the idea that body parts=/=gender identity.Update: edited to reflect the fact that the author of this book now uses she/her pronouns.Show more"

On the one hand, it was one of the first books that was widely published providing teens something of a how-to manual—what certain things mean, what it means to be gay, lesbian, bi or trans, what is the difference between gender, sex and sexuality, politics and law, navigating sex as part of the LGBT community, STI/Ds and HIV, and how to combat religious bigots. It does try to be inclusive.On the other hand, it is very skewed towards gay cis men, with lesbians and trans folk coming in a close second. While it does—briefly—mention ace, aro, pan and bisexual folks, the definitions feel dated and really show the vast amount of social change and awareness that has happened in the LGBTQIA+ community since 2013—particularly because this book barely mentions what it means to be nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, etc.It is very much focused on the binary of the gender spectrum, and while it does go into details of being trans, the trans and lesbian sections feel a lot...skimpier and less detailed than the sections talking about gay cis men. I did like that a lot of scientific research was included for trans folk, along with the various ways trans people express their sexuality, and that the emphasis of it all being valid and right.So.tl;dr—go in for a general this is almost everything overview of the LGBTQIA+ community, while being aware that lots has changed (for better and for worse) for queer folks, including societal norms, laws and political support, and definitions and understanding of gender, sex and sexuality.Show more"

Fischer Verlage erschienen. Es ist eine Neuauflage und ist schon einmal 2015 unter dem selben Titel, aber noch unter dem Namen James Dawson erschienen. Sie ist Transexuell und klärt in diesem Buch über LGBTQ+ auf. Übersetzt wurde das Buch von Volker Oldenburg. Es gibt zwei verschiedene Cover. Das neuere finde ich viel schöner als das Alte (wobei das bei meinem Ebook genauso aussieht) und das Original. Es wirkt durch die Schrift und knalligen Farben moderner und enthält auch eindeutig die Regenbogenfarben, genauso wie die LGBTQ+ Flagge aussieht. Da die Hauptzielgruppen Jungendliche und junge Erwachsene sind passt das sehr gut. Der Titel ist passend gewählt. Man weiß sofort worum es geht. Der Originaltitel lautet „This book is gay“. Die deutsche Übersetzung finde ich persönlich besser, da man sich so mehr angesprochen fühlt und es etwas lustiger ist. Der Schreibstil ist locker und lustig. Ab und zu hätte ich es mir ganz gerne ein bisschen sachlicher gewünscht, da ich es ab und zu ein bisschen over the top gefunden habe. Ein bisschen Übersetzungsprobleme sind mir auch aufgefallen. Es gab einige Fälle in denen nicht richtig gegendert worden ist. So war zum Beispiel in einigen Fällen nur von „dem Partner“, aber nicht von „der Partnerin“ die Rede. Normalerweise ist mir dieses allgemeine gendern relativ egal, ABER in diesem Buch geht es unteranderem um das richtige Gendern und dann sollte man auch darauf achten. Man ist es im deutschen gewohnt, dass meistens nur männlich gegendert wird. Da haben es andere Sprachen einfacher. Zum Beispiel im Englischen gibt es nur „the partner“ für im deutschen „der Partner/Lebensgefährte“ und „die Partnerin/die Lebensgefährtin“. In diesem Buch erzählt die Autorin nicht nur über ihre eigenen Erfahrungen, sondern lässt auch die Erfahrungen von anderen Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen mit einfließen. Ab und zu gibt es auch Zeichnungen und Statistiken. Das lockert das Ganze noch ein bisschen mehr auf und bringt Abwechslung. Fazit: Eins der besten LGBTQ+ Bücher! Hier werden die ganzen Begriffe von gay, lesbisch, bi und LGBTQ+ über Gender, Liebe und Sex einzeln auseinandergenommen und gut erklärt. Mit Klischees wird aufgeräumt. Ein paar Aussagen der Autorin würde ich nicht unbedingt zustimmen, aber es ist ein lockeres Aufklärungsbuch über ein sehr wichtiges Thema. Das Buch ist auch schon für ältere Kinder geeignet. Egal wie viel man über das ganze Thema schon weiß, hier lernt man noch einiges dazu! Show more"

It is written in a very informal and very positive style, and I would recommend it especially for teenagers as it covers the very basics of LGBTQ+ topics and can help young people who are trying to understand themselves and to find their way (to either label or not label themselves, to come out or not etc.). I would also say it’s a good book for parents and teachers to read because it gives them a tool they can use to help their charges along.""This Book is Gay"" is mainly targeted at gays and lesbians even though there is also some snippets on bisexuality and transsexuality. I saw some reviews that critisised this, especially the fact that there was hardly any mention of non-binary genders, asexuality, etc. Yes, that's true (and it would have been much better if the author were not making the assumption that everybody is either male or female and that everybody just wants to have loads of sex). But again, I think this book a) shouts its target audience from its cover page, and b) also covers the basics and it would be a good starting point for anybody who wants to start reading up on being, well, gay. I mean, the book is called “This book is gay” after all, and not “This book is non-binary”... So, I feel like it delivers on what it promises.Should it have been more inclusive? Yes! Is it still a good book to start a conversation and to get more information from there? I definitely think so.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35409485-kayla-rayne,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"July 13, 2015",16 likes,0,"Let me start off by saying that a three star rating is still a good rating from my standpoint. Okay, now that that is out there, let's review. I felt like this was a great book to pick up if you are a little on the clueless end of knowing about LGBT community and other basic information that is typically withheld when discussing sexuality in the massively straight and often times homophobic world. Thankfully, my college program had a great focus on many of the topics discussed in this book so I felt a little more confident in rating the usefulness of the information that it contains. Again, this is a book that will start you off if you already know a fair amount.  One of the things that I really enjoyed about this book was its focus on being true to yourself and not prescribing to labels if that is not what appropriately defines you. For example, there was some information dedicated to those who do not wish to be labeled as gay, lesbian, bi, or transgendered. This book had so much time dedicated to being comfortable with who you are and making sure that you were okay with you doing you. It is always nice to read information that confirms that it is okay to be yourself granted that being yourself doesn't involve hurting others and bringing them down.  Another great focus was on sex education, though I felt this had more focus on sex between two men. There was some information on sex between lesbians and transsexual relationships, but there was a larger focus on two men. However, the bottom line for all of these little lessons is to practice safe sex so, the important message was conveyed. No matter who you are sleeping with, make sure that you are protecting yourself and others from contracting any STDs. There was also some information about HIV that I found very interesting and important to discuss. This was something even my straight and abstinence minded sex-ed teacher did not discuss. This chapter could be a handy guide for those who already have some information on sexual education, but it is not a tell all guide.  The chapter on religions was great as it is something that many people who are religious but also believe in equality might struggle with. I know growing up in the bible belt this has been a constant topic of discussion when it comes to legislation concerning LGBT rights (because some people don't get the separation of church and state thing, I suppose). This was a chapter that I felt could spark some great questions and debate about spirituality and acceptance within religious cultures. I really enjoyed this section.  There were two things that did bother me about the book, despite its attempt to cover all the info, and that was that it skimmed over pan-sexuality and asexuality. There was brief mention of the two but I felt like it was more of a courtesy mention than an actual attempt at giving enough information. I realize that if this book went into greater detail it might be more difficult for someone who is not informed to digest everything, but I strongly wished there was a little more time dedicated to these two topics. I know that those are the two I know least about and I feel like that is a common issue. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and felt like it gave an informative overview of many LGBT related topics. I think this is an easily digestible piece of literature for those starting out, but if you already feel decently informed about the topics, I would skip this one. Show more"

Este libro es Gay es uno de los libros más difíciles que he reseñado en toda mi vida. Estamos ante una especie de manual sobre la comunidad LGTB (que no LGTBIQ) dirigida a jóvenes que quieran saber algo más sobre orientación sexual y género o piensen que quizás pertenezcan a dicha comunidad. Un manual un tanto frívolo y a la vez bueno en determinados aspectos.Sí, es complicado de explicar. A esto hay que sumarle que personalmente no considero que una persona heterosexual (como yo) sea capaz de transmitir al 100% las cosas negativas que tiene este libro. Pero comparto muchísimas opiniones que he leído de personas que pertenecen a esta comunidad y voy a intentar hacéroslas llegar.Empiezo por lo que me parece bueno de este manual. Me parece muy bueno que por fin se haya publicado un manual dirigido a un público joven. ¿Cuánta desinformación hay sobre esta comunidad? ¿Cómo te informaste tú de este tema? Yo me informé sola y poco a poco. Es terrible que hoy en día no se hable de la comunidad LGTBIQ en los institutos, colegios... es terrible la desinformación que hay. Pues bien, este manual es un paso adelante en el proceso de informar que tenemos que llevar a cabo con la sociedad.Otra cosa positiva es que te habla de sexo y otras cosas sin tapujos. Hay dibujos, explicaciones, orientaciones... es un manual muy directo, cercano y que llegará fácilmente a cualquier lector.Es un manual que probablemente resolverá muchas de las dudas que tienen los jóvenes de hoy en día y que abre un poco los ojos hacia un tema que no está para nada normalizado en nuestra sociedad.Ahora vayamos con las cosas negativas que tiene Este libro es gay. Empecemos por su título y portada. Un libro que se vende como gay para vender más porque hay muy pocas novelas que traten sobre el tema. Un libro frívolo que pretende normalizar y que ""desnormaliza"" totalmente con su exterior y su forma de llegar al mercado. Un libro cuyo contenido reza que quiere normalizar pero que no normaliza en ningún momento con lo que nos transmite.Otra cosa negativa es que Este libro es gay dice que es un libro para toda la comunidad LGTB y realmente se centra en la comunidad gay. Deja a un lado a las lesbianas, transgéneros, transexuales y bisexuales. Sí, tiene 5 páginas explicando qué son y de dónde vienen las lesbianas y la palabra lesbiana en sí, perfecto. Pero todo el resto de la novela está centrada en la comunidad gay. Ojo, me parece maravilloso; pero el autor nos vende la obra como dirigida a todo el colectivo.No me gusta que esté dirigida a la comunidad LGTB y olvidemos a la I y la Q, Intersexuales y Queers. Prácticamente no se les nombra y además no se incluye sus siglas cuando se nombra a la comunidad.Creo que Este libro es gay tiene también una parte muy positiva que es el hecho de que nos hace plantearnos qué tipo de educación estamos recibiendo lxs jóvenes cuando desconocemos a una comunidad que es tan normal como cualquier otra y de la que no sabemos casi nada. Nos hace reflexionar sobre el tema, nos hace plantearnos muchísimas cosas y, sobre todo, no normaliza para nada la comunidad LGTBIQ, sino que juega en un mar de contradicciones del que sacará una buena porción de dinero y ventas.Show more"

It was published in 2014 so obv it’s outdated, but it made me so angry I didn’t want to continue reading. This is a great tool tho for teens who’s asking questions about these things. My problems:1. It’s not very inclusive to trans people, but it might be corrected in their new book “What’s the T?” 2. It basically mocks straight people, saying that if they haven’t questioned their sexuality or identity they’re just lying to them selves and others. Some people don’t need to questioned this, it’s just a fact. Like it’s just a fact that some people are gay or asexuals. 3. I hate the world “preference”. If you’re gay you don’t prefer men, because women was never even an option.4. It talks about how it’s okay to explore and yes it definitely is, but please also consider the ones who doesn’t have to. We also know without making out and having sex with everything that breaths. 5. They talk about sexual attraction, but I missed aesthetic and romantic attraction. Yeah, asexuals are mentioned, but I couldn’t find a place where they talked about other kind of attractions. 6. Last but not least, I hate the word “identify”. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I hate it. It makes it sound like it was an option. A friend of mine said it’s mostly about “identifying with labels” and I get that, but I still don’t like it. They also say “sexuality is not a choice, but identity is” it’s not. It��s a choice if you want to do anything about it (if you want to transition, or dress a certain way or change your name etc), but it’s not a choice to be who you are. That’s not the same thing. I think that’s about it. I may try to read it later, but don’t hold your breath. To anyone who doesn’t know shit about being queer this may help you, but consider the things I’ve mentioned.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83729435-luke-kono,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 23, 2024",12 likes,0,"✒︎3 starsThis Book is Gay is the final book I read for a YouTube video on the most banned books in the US. This- second to 
Genderqueer
- is one of the most banned books in the US for the past few years. Should it be banned? No, but unfortunately it suffers from a lot of issues that need to be pointed out. First of all, this book has a very humorous and older-sibling vibe to it, which I generally liked. The author definitely suffers from a bit of ""millennial humor"" however which- although it's a major nitpick- irked me at times. Overall, Dawson has a kind, knowledgable, and caring voice written into the book, which can be helpful for young adults who are questioning their gender/sexuality, or anyone who just wants more knowledge on the LGBTQ community. Her prose made the book quick and enjoyable to get through. At times, she'd make light of very serious subjects such as AIDS which I greatly appreciated since so much of the ""discourse"" around the community can be so doom and gloom.As for the content of this book... well, I won't deny that it could be very insightful for people who are starting from zero. However, if you are more educated on LGBTQ topics and/or have been out and in the community for multiple years, you may find that at certain points the book misses some additional context or nuance. For instance, at one point the author says ""Lesbians like vaginas"". While I did in fact read the revised edition, this statement can definitely be seen as outdated and missing the inclusion of the very existence of transgender people. As the author acknowledges in the forward of the book, it can be very hard to write a book covering the entirety of the large LGBTQ community and our experiences. This is why I feel that 1) this book is a great starting point for those who have no base-level knowledge and 2) it should not be viewed as the ""end all be all"" of the entire community. It makes sense that some subjects were (unintentionally) excluded, or if the author at times said things that could be outdated or even offensive to some readers since she cannot by any means please everyone. With this being said, even within the revised edition, there was certainly a lack of inclusion on trans (particularly non-binary), asexual, aromantic, polyamorous, and at times, bisexual people. As someone who is largely a part of most of these aforementioned communities, I felt that there could have been more included on these subjects. As others have criticized, This Book is Gay certainly focuses on the (cis, male) gay portion of it the most, which didn't offend me, but certainly made me feel a bit left out of the conversation. The tidbits that were included about, say, transgender people were helpful, but largely underdeveloped.Now as for the book being banned. The sex education part of the book is what is most commonly brought up by proponents of the book being banned. I personally don't see any situation where this book would be given to kids who aren't even in high school yet, and I am certain that, so far, the book hasn't been present for any discussions with kids who haven't started puberty yet. The fact of the matter is that LGBTQ sexual education is seen as ""gross"" and ""indoctrination"" when it is just as helpful for kids as straight sex ed is (something that is, along with LGBTQ topics, barely taught in most schools across the US.) The author constantly reiterates to ""BE SAFE"" during any discussions of sex or romance. In no way does sex ed make kids want to have sex (because kids are already doing that- unsafely.) Sex ed helps kids understand themselves, consent, protection, etc. There are times when the author is ""teaching kids how to have sex"", but again this is not equal to ""TELLING kids TO have sex"". Personally, unless I knew a kid was sexually active or would be soon, the sex part of this book could completely be skipped by the reader (which the author states at the beginning of the chapter) since the rest of the book is helpful and age-appropriate for a younger audience. Not the best book I've ever read, and it has its issues, but there nothing so widely lude to warrant it being banned from schools, and especially not public libraries. ✂︎----------check me out on other platforms!

I was expecting less opinion, and more substantive facts. In a section about bullying, the author recommends keeping a journal, with witnesses, dates, etc. Then showing this to an authority-person, because they WILL listen to you. But the next sentence says: If the first person doesn't listen to you... What?? Didn't you JUST say that they WILL listen to you?I am only 40% done and I rarely DNF a book. But I need to stop. There are constant pop-culture references that occur at points that should be a conclusion statement. These should not be ambiguous, or need you to understand something from England (book origin). For as much as the book was saying to ignore stereotypes, for example, the book then went on to go through the stereotypes. Maybe the later part of the book gets better, but I came away with more of a negative feeling. Statements about how you might lose your job, but if you just fight, the law is on your side.The audiobook has a terrible reader. To much individual pronunciation of each word, that makes it not flow well - almost computer/robotic delineation. There is also unnecessary over-inflection on phrases.I cannot recommend this book.Show more"

That said, this book is pretty gay-cis-male heavy (which Dawson points out sometimes can't helped since all scientific research etc has been geared towards the cis male experience because patriarchy, dammit.) Dawson did bring in a queer female writer to co-write a few parts, which I appreciated. However, as much as it tries to be inclusive, the definitions of bi, trans*, ace are a bit ...simplistic? Or outdated. Something. The parts trying to explain trans I found were too basic, non-binary genders weren't mentioned at all, for example, and some parts were worded like anatomy = gender (nope). The best parts are the stories of 300 LGBTQ* people Dawson interviewed for the project -some have a paragraph, others get 4 or 5 pages to themselves- that by highlighting diverse individuals keep the stereotypes away. And some are just adorable. Writing/'Reading Experience': 5/5I read this in a day (which never happens), I think because the writing is so easy and YA-y. It was a lot funnier than I thought it'd be, including the illustrations. The information's well presented and easy to follow and overall 5/5 for the reading experience itself.Meeting expectations: 4.5/5I had a few problems with the content of the book, what was missing, how some things were phrased, etc, so I thought about what this book was trying to be. As an intro to the topic, it's pretty good, and I'm very glad it exists. I hope it finds a place in many school libraries (or, God forbid, is used by teachers.) It covers the basics of LGBT* definitions, stereotypes, history, and all the stuff we were taught as if we're straight like safer sex, STIs, etc, plus coming out tips and advice for parents/carers of LGBTQ* children. I think that's what this book was meant to be and it does it well. If you're expecting a perfectly inclusive, intersectional, nuanced book about the entirety of the gender and sexuality spectrums, this isn't it (and good luck finding one), but I think it's a pretty solid place to start for younger LGBTQ* people, straight/cis people, parents and carers with no or little previous knowledge.Show more"

E nel suo essere una guida secondo me fa tutto bene: è esaustiva perché riporta tanti fatti, tante testimonianze e tante informazioni utili; è educativa perché affronta argomenti quali il genere, la sessualità e il rispetto; ed è pure molto divertente e ironica in vari momenti. Secondo me è un libro che qualsiasi adolescente LGBT* dovrebbe leggere e che dovrebbe essere presente in ogni biblioteca scolastica (anche se è davvero molto esplicito, ma siamo nel 2018 ed è l'ora che il sesso smetta di essere un taboo). Non è da 5 stelle semplicemente perché non è un capolavoro della letteratura, ma è un libro molto importante e soprattutto EDUCATIVO. Perfino io che ormai ho superato l'adolescenza da quel dì ho scoperto cose che non sapevo. In definitiva assolutamente consigliato ad un pubblico giovane, mentre i più grandi magari non lo troveranno così interessante (anche se lo troveranno sicuramente spassoso in alcuni punti).

Be aware that James was white, gay and cisgender [at the time this was written] and that shows but she also states that just about first thing. She does include transgender and mentions a few other sexual orientations. I definitely think there should be more info about other genders and identities like this but frankly it just makes more sense to have indeed more books and not expect it all from one book.

I started out reading it and thought, wow, this has not aged well, and then I read the verso, which said the date of publication was... four years ago. Which was pretty much when my internal voice went, 'Oh... no. This is going to get worse, isn't it?'. Spolier: it did.Did not finish. Really exclusionary of pretty much anyone but cis gay males, pretty much every quote on bisexuality is about not liking labels or actually identifying as something OTHER than bi, either because of being being mislabeled or discriminated against (page 27-28), gender essentialist 'lesbians like vaginas' 'gay men like... big hairy men with big willies' 'penis? check! ...gay men are.. male'(page 51), 'lesbians like vaginas' (page 67), transphobic (so many pages), 'intersex is not so much an identity, as you can't really choose it' (page 37), conflates homophobia and transphobia as basically the same thing without mentioning the transphobia rampant in the broader queer community (pages 72-92). Noped out after genuine anti-semitism on page 111 'Not being funny, but these guys (Jewish people) kinda started it' (about religious homophobia). To eliminate any confusion bout the author's name, the author came out as transgender after publication, so the first name on the cover is one that shares the initial J with the author's preferred name, Juno. My reaction to discovering this development was thinking that I really hope Juno works through the utterly pervasive transphobia that is inescapable in this work. Carrying that is toxic. But the fact that the author has come out as transgender doesn't make this work any less transphobic. In fact, it's worse, because it makes it harder to argue the damage this book can do when it's coming from a now-out transgender person, something I will be doing with my library system shortly.In summary - this book would have been revolutionary ten or fifteen years ago, because nothing like this existed. It still would have been toxic. Time and correct terminology has moved on, but at its core, this would have always been a work that placed more emphasis on trying to be crude and cool to appeal to young people, which is a tragic mistake. Anything that tries this hard is never going to be cool in the eyes of a teenager. Add to that the spadefuls of misinformation, glossing over of history and hate crimes, erasure, exclusion, and casual super gross misogyny for the sake of jokes ('Lesbians like vaginas. They don't even want blokes watching. I KNOW, how INCONSIDERATE.' - page 67), and this is a book that doesn't even come close to matching the promise of its beautiful, bold, inclusive, balanced cover. Show more"

I blazed through it, probably because it felt like the pretty, packaged LGBTQ* education I never got in school. As James Dawson points out, there is a horrifying degree of institutional homophobia present even in the most progressive education systems - in my very liberal Los Angeles middle school & high school, any sex ed I ever experienced was completely heterosexual (babymaking). ""This Book Is Gay"" is a straightforward and funny breakdown of all things LGBTQ* (understanding sexuality/gender, LGBT ""sexyfuntime,"" fighting bigotry/religion, finding support/community, dating apps, LGBT icons, etc).

If not, don't be fooled by claims that this guide is meant for all LGBTQ+ folk, because it's just not.I'm sure This Book Is Gay came from a good place, but I don't get how this was supposedly updated to be more informed and modern because a lot of language use was really weird. I read an ARC so some phrases may change, but a lot of the descriptions and definitions felt simplified to the point of being detrimental. For example, trans people are described as ""wanting to be"" the opposite gender (Juno herself is trans so I'm sure the intent was there, but treating being trans as a want and choice was a weird decision), readers are told that in a broad sense, bisexuality means liking both men and women when in an actual broad sense, it means liking more than one gender, and nonbinary people are treated as an increasing trend of people deciding to reject the gender binary. Asexuality is basically only referenced in the definition section and two definitions are provided, the standard lack of sexual interest one and one the book frames as the more modern definition involving a refusal to define one's sexual orientation. I'm not ace so I'm not the most informed there, but I've never heard that second definition used so it was weird it was framed as more modern than the main definition.A lot of the tips surrounding and references to queer folk are only really applicable to white readers (for example there's a whole section on stereotypes and lingo and I'm pretty sure there wasn't a single term not commonly used in white queer communities) and most of the book in general just assumes that the reader is opposite-sex attracted despite this being marketed as for all queer folk.

I may have been more lenient on it if it hadn’t claimed to be an instructional manual for being queer, but since it is—and especially since it’s marketed toward teenagers—this book has the potential to be actively harmful.I do not want to negate the good that this book has done. There are good parts of this book, like the discussion about how people should be free to be who they are. This author also contains good, practical advice about what to do when being bullied or when coming out. It’s clear that we need books where being queer is being celebrated. We need books where young people are able to see themselves represented. We need young people to have the resources to embrace their identity and to live into the life they want for themselves. This book is not ALL bad.However.There are so many problematic aspects of this book. For one thing, other reviewers have talked more eloquently than I could about how this book centers the cis gay male experience and doesn’t adequately handle the conversations about lesbians, bisexuals, and trans people. If that was the only issue, I may have been able to look past it.But that’s not all.For another thing, this book entirely erases the voices of asexual people—or even anyone who isn’t thinking about sex all the damn time, because according to Juno Dawson, everyone is. If I have to read the phrase “everyone wants to have sex all the time” again I am going to break down Juno Dawson’s door and leave a copy of Ace by Angela Chen. This rhetoric is so harmful and problematic. For that reason, I cannot recommend this to any young person in the queer umbrella, because some ace person is going to read this book and feel so dismissed and belittled. The focus on sex as one of THE defining characteristics of being queer, and the fact that there is so much discussion about it, was quite bizarre. I get the need for sex education, but this book seemed to have an almost single-minded focus on all the ways queer people can have and get sex that other aspects of being queer are totally erased.This book is hardly the instructional manual it claims to be, and I would never recommend it. Queer youth are much better off reading or watching Heartstopper. I understand that Juno Dawson may have grown a lot after writing this book since it was published in 2014 (I also think I may have read the updated version, which... YIKES!), but I am wary of picking up anything by this author in the future. If this is the instructional manual for being queer, maybe we don’t need an instruction manual after all.Show more"

I was so deep in denial, I'd pretty much dug a hole all the way to the center of the earth and it took me another 10 years before I could accept the fact that I like boys and girls, and that that is okay. The things mentioned in this book are stuff we never talked about at school or in sex ed or whatever. I think I was 14 when I realized girls could like girls too (this being after a year of me rattling off crush after crush on various girls, my music teacher included ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and I think the coming 8 years of my life would have been easier, had I been given this book at 14.It truly is an amazing resource for LGBTQ+ youth!! Being 24 and way too old for this book, I still found it a great read even though I knew everything it said. It was very pedagogic and funny but a few things rubbed me the wrong way.You could tell this book was written by a white cis gay dude (""Women can be sexist towards men!!"" ""Let's all just talk at length about gay men and maaaaaaaaybe mention lesbians too!! And oh, don't forget to squeeze trans people in there too!"" ""Trans women are men that want to be women!!!"").Some of the things that irked me were how focused on (cis) gay men this book was while poopooing misogyny (dude, if you haven't noticed it, gay men ARE often more misogynistic than their straight counterparts....so maybe mention that too? And also while focusing on gay men you ARE being misogynistic). I'm cis so it's maybe not my place to speak about this but from what I've heard actual trans people say, this book is swimming in misconceptions about everything trans. Oh and don't forget, this book doesn't mention nonbinary trans folks AT ALL. Because they don't exist...clearly. Also I sort of remember this book saying it was going to be inclusive of asexuals? Well, it straight up isn't. It explicitly said ""EVERYONE LIKES SEX!!!"" dude, no. I wish the author would have focused on the asexual spectrum AND the split attraction model a bit too.

A lot has changed in 4, almost 5 years since it was published. There were several things wrong with this book, but the main thing that got me is that is more focused on the Gay side of the LGBTQ+ community. It barely talks about being Lesbian, Bisexual, Trans, Queer or even Asexual (as myself). To me, it felt like perhaps it was a good book back then, because it talks about gender, sexual preference, and it even has a sex chapter in it. But, the problem is that is only the tip of the iceberg of the community as a whole. I’m guessing this book was meant to be read by young people who are trying to figure out their sexuality, because the main message of this is ”Being whatever the hell you want is OK”. Still, for grown people such as relatives, friends or allies of the LGBTQ+ it might be a bit lacking of information and understanding. I don’t feel that This Book is Gay is the book you might want to read in order to understand our community. I mean, yes, it talks about how to meet people you might fancy thanks to an app (Grindr), or how to have safe sex (and the consequences of not doing it so), but the fact is that not even the testimonies could save this book. Like I said, the problem is that this didn’t age well. I think that the author made a good job, back then. It even talks about LGBT icons and so on, but man, this needs updating, and the awareness that not all people want to have sex (HELLO! I’M AN ASEXUAL HERE! WE DO EXIST!). The good thing is that I didn’t buy this and I only listened to the audiobook. On that part, the narrator made a terrific work and highly recommend you to do the same if you’re still interested in reading this book.Show more"

However, as a book that describes itself as the instruction manual you should get when you enter the LGBTQ+ community, I do wish it had distributed its time more equally. It was very focused on the LGT aspects of the community, which all seemed well written, but it would have been nice to have more time spent on the unique elements of life for those who are in the community who aren’t (or aren’t exclusively) Lesbian, Gay, or Trans. In particular, I noticed that Bi, Aro, Ace, Non-binary, and Genderqueer identities were briefly mentioned, but not discussed with nearly the same level of depth. This would have been very nice. Another thought: if there ends up being another edition of this book, it would be great to use more frequent gender inclusive language that doesn’t refer to men and women only. There were certainly points where the language was inclusive, but it wasn’t consistent.On the whole, though, a very informative book that I’m glad I got the chance to read.Show more"

It provides a lot of great information for young people questioning or discovering their sexuality. However when the book says it talks about LGBT+ identities, the + is an outright lie. In fact not only does it not talk about identities that are not gay/lesbian/bi/trans, it actually uses a lot of language that is really shaming towards asexual, aromanitic, polyamorous, and genderqueer people. The book several times uses the common, but transphobic language of strongly associating genitals with gender. And it just plainly gets several facts wrong. Granted, this book was writer by a cis gay man and the things I particularly noticed as being wrong were about bisexuality and female sex so I can understand why he gets things wrong, but I mean come on, do some research. First of all, bisexuality is defined in the book as attraction to men and women, a definition the bisexual community rejected YEARS ago for being transphobic. The community tends to define themselves as being attracted to their own and other genders. Also he tries to sound cool and mysterious by talking about the ""myth"" of the g-spot. Of course a simple google search or a sexplanations video would very clearly explain that this ""mysterious g-spot"" is really the place where the internal clitoris rests against the vaginal walls. Also, believe it or not, sex toys aren't all meant to replace penises. They have a variety of uses, only one of which is penetrative vaginal sex.Okay I know I'm kind of tearing this apart but these are important pieces of information that kids could be using this book as a source for (speaking of sources, where were the authors?????). If you're going to write a book like this it NEEDS to be inclusive and accurate. Like I said, this book has a great deal of really important information and I am so great full that it was written, I just wish James Dawson had been a little more conscious of those who don't share his own experience and opinions of sex and relationships while writing it.

This action was performed entirely out of love, but, at the same time out of a need for a laugh.This Book is Gay is a sweet little book that I wish had existed when I was a teenager. The Closeted young man that I was probably wouldn't have read this book for fear of social rejection, but I wish it had existed for those DL moments in between crushing on characters in The Lord of the Rings. This book is obviously a wonderful resource for queer people like me, and obviously for queer teenagers and young adults who are just recognizing their sexuality for what it is, and the images that accompany the text only make it sweeter. The ""bumming"" passage had me on the floor.I agree with many of the reviewers however in that this book is a little one sided. It's obvious that Dawson is a cisgender gay man and can write honestly about that experience, but he's a little weak when it comes to lesbian sex and identity issues, and his facts about Trans people needs some improvement.That does NOT damn this book to mediocrity. Like many books about Queer people, queer lifestyles and queer history this book can lead the reader to other books and resources that can continue to lead people toward self-recognition and self-discovery. And I stand by what I wrote before, this book is most certainly wonderful for you queer kids who are just starting out and are looking for some kind of context or help about their identity. This book is fun, and being queer is fun. It should be fun and not a nightmare, and so Dawson's book is an excellent reminder that being queer is just one facet of one's identity, but it can certainly be one of the most fabulous parts.Show more"

It gives insight on multiple lgbtq+ people's experiences, while simultaneously making you laugh out loud.There isn't really much to say, other than that this book suits better young gay men than it does any other group. The author, a gay man, started this book with a great and funny introduction on sexuality, and all the ways it can be experienced. But, it the second half of the book, where he started exploring it a bit more, made it feel as if it was only written for gay men. He was giving Grindr tips, and any time he needed to make an example, gay men were his go-to.It's reasonable, since it's how the writer identifies and it's what he knows best. But, I would've liked him to explore a bit more about what discrimination bisexual people face, for example. He could've also talked about the erasure not only bisexual, but pansexual and asexual people face within the lgbtq+ community. I would have talked about all of that and I'm only 14, so my experiences are really limited. See, it's not that hard to be more inclusive and discuss different experiences. One thing I liked though, was that when he talked about gay people's experiences with dating, he also talked about trans' people experience with dating. Idk, it might be just because I'm used to trans people being put aside in these dating tips for lgbT people, but I really liked it.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was fun, insightful and a bit of what I'd like to say but don't have the guts to. I recommend it to young gay people, especially gay men and women who are just looking for a light but informative read.Show more"

But I recently joined a queer book club where this was the first monthly pick, so I figured I’d better give it a reread so that I could properly discuss, and a friend was kind enough to give me a spare copy of the 2020 rerelease. Unfortunately, it’s ended up being a really disappointing experience and I’m afraid I’m about to unleash a whole mess of negativity, so if that’s not your jam, feel free to leave. Before I do, I’m going to preface it all by saying this has no bearing on my feelings about Juno herself, I think she’s an absolutely fantastic author, a massive force for good for the LGBT+ communities, and a lovely person (based on the limited chats I’ve had with her at events). I also know this is one of the go to books for all things LGBT+ youth and it’s extremely well loved, so I’m not shitting on that; if you’ve found it helpful, that’s great, and I recognise that it has (and deserves) a significant place in the world of LGBT+ YA. This is just my experience reading it. (Also just warning you, this review is all over the place; I wrote it as I was reading and then tweaked so it’s probably incoherent and switching tense all the way through and everything, but nobody’s paying me for this so who gives a shit. 😂)Now. Getting into my issues with it. As a trans person herself, Juno is absolutely more than welcome to think and talk about her own identity however makes sense for her, and of course I know there’s no one correct definition for any of this stuff so she’s not wrong. However. I do think that when you’re writing a book where the specific point is education, you have to be really careful about the way you phrase things and sorry but anything involving the words ‘want’, ‘choose’ or ‘prefer’ to talk about trans (or wider LGBT+) identity feeds into a really harmful stereotypical narrative. I was genuinely wincing at the first page. She goes on to write a whole section about her use of those words and includes the line ‘Sexuality and gender identity are very much about preference’ and just NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE. It feels really contradictory cos at times she says things like ‘LGBTQ people do not choose to be LGBTQ’ but then wtf is she on about with all that ‘preference’ stuff?! I do agree that there are aspects of identity that are about choice (eg being trans isn’t a choice but transitioning can be, or that you don’t choose your orientation but you can choose how to label that etc) but I don’t feel like this is explaining that distinction well enough so it could come across really confusing if you don’t already know your shit. She uses the word ‘sexthoughts’ to refer to any feelings of anything gender or sexuality related, and I really dislike this concept because again, negative stereotypes. It’s taken a very long time to start to move away from LGBT+ identities being super tied up with sex itself (and therefore deemed inappropriate for polite conversation, to be kept in the bedroom, and definitely not something for children) so to me this just feels like it perpetuates another wrong perception and opens doors for people to reject the need to talk about it. In general she writes very flippantly and doesn’t seem to pay much attention to language beyond making it amusing. Even little things like the many references to ‘bum sex’ made me a bit uncomfortable because it’s so oversimplified and just feels like fuel to stupid teenage boys going ‘HA HA BUM SEX’, and who is that helping? Also, I find it really jarring that she’s writing for teens and putting in really dated pop culture references about The L Word and such. Just don’t try. In general I actually just really don’t like the writing style, it’s like she’s purposely trying to make it funny, informal, teen language and it just comes across like your mum saying ‘I’m down with the kids’; it misses the mark for me and feels cringey and inauthentic. It says in the foreword about how she’s listened to feedback to make this version more inclusive but it seems like that has just meant going ‘oh, and the plus bit’ every now and again. The ideology itself still feels incredibly binary and sex-centric. I’m getting really frustrated at the amount of times I’m reading some variation of the phrase ‘every gay or bisexual, or trans man or woman’. WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE? WHAT CAN’T YOU JUST SAY EVERY LGBT+ PERSON?! Even simple things like saying ‘him or her/he or she’ - why would you still write that when you could just put them/they? Not only would that be more inclusive, it’s actually EASIER?! And acespec identities are a complete afterthought, because according to this, LGBT+ people are just constantly snogging and bumming. 😑 So yeah, overall it’s great for cis gay boys, ok for cis gay girls, passable for binary trans people, and woe betide anybody outside of those identities.Beyond the LGBT+ as well, there were a fair few times where I just felt excluded, judged, and uncomfortable. She uses works like ‘freak’ quite often and a couple of the quotes that stood out to me and made me wince were ‘NO ONE WANTS TO SHAG A BALD SPOTTY PSYCHO WITH BALLS LIKE SHRIVELLED RAISINS.’ and ‘If you don’t give your age, weight and height [on an app], people will assume you’re old, fat and tiny.’ How is this supposed to feel if you’re reading this as someone who’s bald, spotty, fat, short, struggles with mental health etc? It feels like it’s really feeding into that gay male stereotype of being shallow and mean, and reinforcing ridiculous societal beauty standards and just NO. Like I said, it feels like she’s just trying to be as funny as possible and do that thing of ‘I’ll shock the teenagers with my rude words and get them onside’ but it’s just as if she’s sinking to the level of bullying with them and it’s really hurtful. As well as the continued exclusivity, I’m also just confused at how little it seems to have been updated content wise? It was ‘revised and updated’ in 2020 yet still all the statistics are from pre 2014, including the Stonewall School Report, of which the 2012 findings are included despite the fact that it was redone in 2017. It’s been fact checked in terms of like ‘ok is homosexuality still illegal in these countries’ and it seems some slightly more current ‘icons’ have been added to the list at the end, but I don’t think it reads as if any perspectives have evolved or anything, which I just can’t believe is the case in that timeframe. (As evidenced by my ‘I didn’t know any better and didn’t notice the exclusivity of this’ 5 star rating on my first read, compared with the evolution of my understanding now.) I regularly deliver LGBT+ training as part of my job and I at least glance over and update if not completely overhaul my presentations and resources every couple of months so how can you possibly go back to a book six years later and not just end up rewriting the bastard?!Aaaand now I’ve come across a bit that’s just straight up factually incorrect. On coming out as trans, ‘people under the age of 18 will be referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)’. This often does happen by ill-informed GPs, but that doesn’t mean it’s the correct route. A CAMHS referral is only necessary for managing risk in young people with identified symptoms of mental ill health, not just as a default for anyone experiencing gender dysphoria. Many trans young people are inappropriately referred to CAMHS, which delays their own referral into Gender Identity Development Services, increases waiting lists for young people who genuinely do need CAMHS, and reinforces the idea to young people and those around them that their trans identity is a mental illness, thus harming their self esteem (and in a lovely self fulfilling prophecy, their mental health! 🙃) and making many parents and carers reluctant to support their transition. I deal with the impact of this harmful misinformation every day at work so I could really do with it not being perpetuated by the educational resources please and thanks. The sex ed stuff was a bit of a minefield for me. I do think it’s absolutely necessary and positive to talk about sex (and not just sexual health, but sexual pleasure and all other aspects) with young people in a frank way, and this certainly didn’t shy away from it. However, I think she possibly went a little overboard on the ‘let’s talk about Grindr and saunas and giving the best blowies’ and it felt like it was massively glorifying ‘the gay scene’ in a way that just wasn’t necessary. (Which I know makes me sound like I’m clutching my pearls. I’m not. I don’t mean that I think it’s inappropriate, it just didn’t all feel relevant. It felt like what Juno wanted to say rather than what the readers needed to hear, if that makes sense?) As I’ve already mentioned, the narrative of the whole thing suggests sex as The Norm and implies everybody wants it, and the sex ed chapter in particular was riddled with this in the form of what might feel like throwaway comments to some, but could actually feel really alienating to someone who’s acespec, or so dysphoric they can’t think about sex, etc. It’s also, again, incredibly cisnormative, binary, and focuses almost entirely on gay boys/men and lesbian girls/women, leaving very little room for anything else. A couple of specific parts of this chapter really angered me as well. Juno includes a testimonial from a guy whose first sexual encounter was on the day of his 16th birthday, with a guy who was ‘older and married’, with whom there’d been flirtation ‘for a few months’. That sounds pretty not ok to me and I’m not exactly comfortable with it being presented naturally alongside other virginity stories, with no suggestion that actually an older man grooming a 15 year old for sex is paedophilia. There’s also a line in this section that flippantly says ‘And, dear God, wear a condom. Wear two.’ Wearing two condoms is actually really risky as the friction between them can make them more likely to break, so in a chapter dedicated to sex education, that is trying to make young people more informed and advocating for safer sex, that’s a really irresponsible thing to say. I do have to remember that my job is rooted in being an LGBT+ ‘expert’ (ew, not a thing) and I live in a very queer bubble so I can’t expect everything else to be quite as progressive as what I’m used to, but I think I’m just really disappointed cos I thought this was going to be so much more in line with where my head’s at. I think often when someone’s just woefully wrong on it all it’s not as bad, but the closer they are the more you notice the discrepancies, so seeing someone be so understanding about bi erasure in one passage, but then consistently use binary language (for example) is just so jarring. It might seem unfair to judge it so harshly, cos I’m sure to other audiences this is the perfect educational resource, and I do recognise that there are elements which are brilliant and its existence is doing so much good in the world. But my ratings are supposed to be about my own personal experience of reading a book, and I have to be honest with myself. It feels blasphemous to give this such a low score but here we are....I’m gonna establish myself very early on as That Dick in book club aren’t I? 😩🤦🏽‍♂️Show more"

I'm glad that our society is finally giving way to books like this one. I don't think it would have been as well-received 20 years ago. Things are changing for the better now, and that's fantastic. We can discuss sexuality and gender in a massively heterosexual and often homophobic/transphobic world.It treats important topics in an informative, insightful and informal way, which makes reading fun, but it's serious when it has to be, as when it talks about countries that still insist on punishing homosexuals with the death penalty. And, fortunately, I can say that I've broken some prejudices - because, who said that gays don't have/had prejudices about their community?I liked this book, although there are excerpts about bisexuality and transgender people, gays are more represented than lesbians - well, at the time, the author was a man, so that must be why. I said ""was"" because, at the end of 2015, James Dawson began the gender transition. Today, Juno Dawson is a strong and wonderful trans woman. There is some information about trans people, but if you want to know a lot of details, you better look for another book. As for other identities, such as non-binary, asexual, and pansexual, they are mentioned once or twice without any description. This inclusion is missing, I agree, but it's still a great book to start a conversation and get information about homosexuality. However, in any case, the book delivers what it promises, after all, the title refers to gay people.If you need help to find out what your sexual and/or gender identity is, or if you just want to know the basics about homosexuality, bisexuality and trans people, I highly recommend it. In the end, there is a list of useful websites and phone numbers if you need more support, or if you want help but don't know where to go, or if you want answers to your questions. Whatever the case, this should be a book on your reading list.The chapter about religions was great because I know what it's like to be gay and be raised in a religious family, where discussing LGBT rights is almost heresy. It's a shame that many people still can't separate church and state. Anyway, this was a chapter that could bring up other great questions and debates about spirituality and acceptance within religious cultures.Overall, I liked this book and felt it gave an overview and information about many topics related to the LGBT community. It's a nice reading, but if you already feel decently informed about the topics considered basic, I recommend that you read something else.Show more"

I did enjoy many parts of the book where I laughed or learned something new or wanted to clap and go ""Yep!!! He got that one soooo right!"" But there were many cases (a little too many to bear for me) in which either James Dawson was wrong or erased on parts of the LGBTQIA+ community. Bisexuality was usually only mentioned in a list, i.e. when Dawson would say something applies to gays, bisexuals, etc. Transgender was often more of a side note, with several paragraphs on something that goes for gays and lesbians and then one /maybe/ two paragraphs on transgender people. Intersex, I think, was mentioned one or two times. I'm pretty sure non-binary gender identities were not discussed. This book mainly focused on the L and G and sometimes the T of the LGBTQ+ community. Yes, the book is called ""This Book is /GAY/"" but when the description of the book and the pages within often mention the entire queer/genderqueer community, it would be nice if we were more included. Just mentioning the rest of the community more and providing more information would have added a simple 10 pages at least, and I don't think that is asking for much.(NOTE: I originally wrote this review in January of 2016, and I am now editing it in November/nearly December of 2018. I really only took a few things out since a couple of my opinions have changed on certain things, and also I labeled myself as an identity that I do not identify with anymore.

For a sex-repulsed, non-binary, aroace person, this book isn't that helpful. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and others need this information to be shared with them so they don't put themselves or others in danger, but for me specifically, I was hoping for more.

And also some downright dangerous nonsense. The author uses every euphemism imaginable for penis and vagina instead of using proper terms. Is this supposed to appeal to the youths? I found it weird. Idk. Maybe use *some* euphemisms but not constantly. The youths are smarter than this. Having an entire chapter on how stereotypes are “poo”? — A+. Reinforcing gay stereotypes at every turn? —no thank you.  After a while the entire book started to feel like a bizarre exercise in telling you one thing but saying another. For example “it’s harmful to assume all gays love Beyoncé” a few chapters later “welcome to the gay team! Here are the people you will worship: #1, Beyoncé.” The biology portion was rushed, unfounded gobbledygook sure to leave kids (and adults) with more questions than answers. Why are we citing studies that have been disproven? This chapter was so confusing and had weird homophobic vibes, which I was not expecting. I’m so confused as to why it was written. It would’ve been better to have a bio chapter that explained “the Gender Elephant” instead of a chapter briefly explaining a bunch of weird theories and studies that have been done…often in bad faith. In the “losing your gay virginity” section we are presented with several first-hand accounts, the last of which is a 16yo (child) losing their virginity to an adult guitar store owner (predator). There is nothing written further to say “hey kids…this isn’t normal, safe, or healthy. If an adult in a guitar store rubs your crotch tell a trusted adult.” WTF? That’s irresponsible and dangerous writing. Come on, Juno. Treat writing for marginalized teens with the gravitas it deserves. Transphobia abounds. Nonbinary people are an afterthought at best. Don’t tout yourself as a guidebook for all LGBTQ+ if you aren’t. “We all want to have sex all the time!” Asexuals *exist.* I’m glad that we as a society have evolved to have books in the YA section proudly displaying GAY on the cover…but as a parent looking for a book to help my teens find their gay lil way in the world, this falls short of the mark.

My first instinct was to love the heck out of her and my second was to get her information, support, and resources so she can navigate our heteronormative and homophobic culture with her self-concept in tact. So I put my feelers out and my lgbt student of three years highly recommended this book for her. We got it immediately on audible and we listened to it together initially, while I lesson planned and she did art, and then the next day she finished it. Boom. Just like that she gobbled it up. We also got the hard copy later which I recommend doing because the art, graphic organizers, diagrams, etc. are amazing and can’t be captured on audible. I read some other reviews critical of this book for not being inclusive of all lgbtqia+ people; that it is a book written by a gay man for gay men, and that may be fair. But, in any case, it is also very affirmative of queer identities, informative, humorous, and accessible for young people. (The man who wrote it was a high-school teacher in the UK for many years.) And my queer kid loved it and I love her, so that is a good enough rave review for me. Further, this book made me realize some of the ins and outs of my own homophobia that I didn’t realize I had, not out of malice but just out of ignorance, and for that reason alone I would recommend it to anyone; this book speaks truth to power in many ways and for someone straight like me, provides insight into what it’s like to be gay and how much courage it takes to live that truth, how necessary it is to claim that truth in order to be happy, and how joyful it is to be who you really are in the world. I loved it when he said that given the choice, he’d choose to be gay and that he loves being gay. That is exactly the life-affirming message I want my daughter to hear about her queer identity. Because of the solid information in this book, including the two chapters on gay sex Ed (which made me question why we only teach about straight sex in sex Ed at school [as if that’s the only kind of sex worth teaching and learning about]), and for the positive and affirming messages about queer identities, I especially recommend this book for lgbt young people who are beginning their journey of self-discovery around their sexual identity and to their parents who, mistakenly and ignorantly, assumed their kid was straight only to realize they made that assumption the moment they found out their kid was gay. It’s a lot to process. Life is a lot to process and books like this book help us do just that. Thank god I’m a public school teacher and have all the stories of my students who’ve come out to their parents over the years in the back pocket of my mind. Thank goodness I’ve loved, and admired, so many gay kids already in my life. I knew what not to do and now I’m learning what to do as my daughter’s mom. Really though, this hasn’t been as incredulous as it might sound to some parents. I’ve known for a long time I just need to connect my daughter with resources and opportunities and then get out of her way. This book is an awesome support and resource! Finding out my daughter is gay has been like finding out she loves legos, painting, camping, and reading. It’s just who she is and in many ways, it’s been just like everything else I’ve learned about being a mom in the 13 years she’s made me a mom; my job is to find out who my kid is and then love her for exactly that and support the holy hell out of her. If you’re a parent who sees parenting the way I do, and your kid recently came out to you, first love them and then get your kid this book, go to pride, decorate your fridge with pride flag magnets, connect them with GSA at their school, and other allies, etc. That’s my plan anyway. It’s like my kid just told me she loves soccer and I’m putting her on a great team and going to drive her to practice. Every kid who comes out should be loved and affirmed, most especially first and foremost by their parents. This book is a great place to start!Show more"

To be fair, I haven't read much queer non-fiction, but I still feel that this book leaves me kind of bored. It was probably great for the time it came out, but it's 2022, and so much has evolved. My main critiques:-just use the word 'queer'. Most LGBT+ people are more than comfortable with it, and you should be too. -there was like no non-binary rep? At all? It mentioned gender-queer very briefly, but that was the extent.-although the whole sex Ed chapter was interesting and all, I feel like it was lacking. Women need to experience safe sex, and I feel like it only stressed gay/male safe sex. Which is kinda concerning. The reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1, was because the chapter on Religion was actually fascinating. I felt it was super well studied and for the most part correct. But besides that, it just left more to be desired for me. Sure, this book is probably great for young gay men who didn't grow up around queer circles at all, but there's a lot more to the community. All in all, I'm just disappointed. This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157286152-patty,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"October 21, 2022",3 likes,0,"This book claims to be a guidebook for all LGBT+ people and anyone else who is curious. This is a false claim.POSITIVES: I’m sure this book would be very helpful to a cis gay man. It has some useful information and stories about questioning, relationships, and gay male sex. The section on coming out may be helpful to someone unsure of how to (though I do believe Dawson stresses the importance of coming out too much without saying that it isn’t always the right choice and playing down these situations). If someone knows absolutely nothing about the LGBT+ community, the stories in this book may help them be more comfortable with themself.NEGATIVES:This book is not as inclusive as it claims to be. Dawson defines lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, and transgender at the beginning of the book. She then focuses on the LGT for the rest. You can hardly call this inclusive when she only mentions 5 of the many identities and goes beyond that for 3 of them. Even then, the information is insufficient aside from for gay men. She never talks about genders besides the binary and intersex and has a narrow view of what being transgender means. The sex-ed for lesbian sex lacks vital information about safety. I understand it’s unrealistic to include every identity under the rainbow, but more effort and research should be put in about these and other umbrella identities for a book claiming to be an “instruction manual.”It is also inconsistent and makes harmful generalizations. After acknowledging that asexual people exist and some people do not want sex, Dawson later writes:“WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE.” (210)Did she forget one of the few groups she mentioned earlier? It happens more than once, but this was the first example that came to mind. Dawson makes sweeping generalizations about how everyone settles down with a romantic partner eventually and everyone wants sex and gay men love penises and baptists have a problem with gay people. These statements can plant bad assumptions in someone’s mind about themself or others, especially if they’re reading this book blind from any prior knowledge.Finally, and this is just a personal opinion, I didn’t really like the narrative voice. I guess I saw “instruction manual” and thought it would be more educational and factual. Instead, it sometimes gives solely Dawson’s opinion (like her thoughts on coming out and dating tips) and uses a tone that I find hard to understand. Maybe this is because I am younger and newer to the LGBT+ community, but I didn’t recognize a lot of the slang terms she used and they threw off my reading experience. It’s not as serious as I hoped it would be, but I know others would like this friendly writing style.SUMMARY:Overall, I think this book does more harm than good. It may help some gay, lesbian, or transgender people, but the generalizations made could also give them negative attitudes toward other identities. The book isn’t very helpful beyond the basics for anyone other than LGBT. Questioning people may not find the information they need because it provides so little variety, and they may finish reading this thinking they don’t quite belong to the community (or thinking others they know don’t belong). I was excited to read this book, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.Show more"

I really enjoyed the doodles and the casual style. It made for a relaxing read. There were quite a few parts that led to confusion.For example, when the author says sexual orientation is a ""preference."" That's an issue because it implies the person has a choice. Later on in the book, it does say orientation is not a choice. So the author's position isn't too clear. Same for transgender people, the author says ""some men might want to be women"" and ""some women might want to be men."" Words like these are dangerous because they can easily be used by transphobic people to claim transgender people just choose their gender, which they don't. Later on though, the author says it's not a choice. So same thing, not too clear what the message is. I guess I would say some phrasings were problematic. To me, it is also problematic when people insist on forcing others to come out. It puts a lot of pressure on teenagers. No one HAS to come out to be part of the LGBT club... being LGBT makes one part of the club already. No one owes it to others to come out either. Yes, visibility is key to the LGBT community, but when it comes to teenagers, safety should always come first! Telling teens to come out, and that if there is a problem, they can seek help from friends or LGBT groups is some dangerous advice to give. Teenagers have their whole lives in front of them. Things DO get better. LGBT people do live happy lives. They get accepted, have tons of friends, create new families, have loving partners. If one's family is anti-LGBT, safety comes first. There will be years and years of adulthood to be one's true self later. :) Be proud! But be safe! Focus on yourself, your future, your studies, your safety, your happiness. I LOVED how the book insisted on safe sex! Yes, yes, yes! Condoms! 🙌🙌The list of gay icons...Mmmm... Where are Freddy Mercury, Boy George, George Michael, ect on the list? The book says there aren't many Hollywood gay icons. That's so not true... there are MANY gay and bisexual actors. I could write a full page of names!

The target audience is teens, or maybe new adults (not me), and more specifically readers who are growing up today (definitely not me). While I am clearly not the target audience, I was a little uncertain about who is. Teens and new adults seem likely, but the language style seems focused on teens, while a lot of the advice seems focused on those of drinking age or over. This has a very conversational, “hello fellow kids” kind of tone. No book that covers puberty and sexual health related topics will ever cover everything for everyone. (That’s why having a variety of books is so important.) This one focused a lot on identity at the outset, both sexual and gender-wise, and how that plays a very important role in who we are. I found that part to be generally informative and organized. The second half of the book focuses more on sex and sexual mechanics and a bit on dating. And this is where I felt I really lost track of who this book should be for. As the chapters oscillated between sex, and then a brief stop for dating, then more sex, and then an acknowledgment that not all intimacy comes from sex, and then meandered into queer icons, some reminders for parents, and finally additional resources, this part was much more chaotic. There were references to apps, club scenes, and drinking, that were all mixed in with reminders and suggestions for how to stay safe (or at least reduce risk). There were also some assumptions, or maybe sarcasm, that didn’t quite land with me. For myself, I like a plainer and more ordered representation of facts and less ALL CAPS. But as a resource for people exploring their own identity, or looking for information on how LGBTQ+ life might unfold, this approach might work great. I found the one star reviews very interesting, as I was expecting a litany of homophobic pearl clutching. But there was more dissatisfaction about representation and accuracy. So (as with any material that tackles such intensely personal topics), explore with caution and with the idea that no single source will have all the information. But I found nothing remotely pornographic or obscene, just some very matter-fact-description of sexual education topics interspersed with dramatic, youthful language.This book was removed from school libraries in Dearborn in 2022 (https://www.freep.com/story/news/loca...).

By the time it got re-released in 2020, I'd been a card-carrying member of the Alphabet Mafia for a while, so I figured I didn't need it then either. And while I was right that a lot of the info in this book would be things I already knew, I'm still so glad I got the privilege to read it and transcribe it into braille, because it really is a fun, refreshing, well-informed guidebook on all things capital-G Gay. Dawson's writing style makes the depressing statistics a little less depressing and the long, factual bits a lot less boring. Also, while I'm sure she would have rather been out and living as a trans woman at the time of this book's initial publication, I do find some comfort that even an ""ancient gay scholar"" like herself (her words, not mine) still realized she had room to grow and evolve and did not apologize for it. As a young trans person, it gives me hope for my own future and that of my fellow gender-nonconforming pals. I picked up another copy of this book to give to my straight-and-unsure-how-to-be-supportive mother (to later be donated to her neighborhood's little library, where I dream it may find its way into the hands of a baby gay who needs it), and I also grabbed Dawson's latest book on transgenderism for myself.

I liked how affirming it is of LGBTQ+ people. Above all else, it emphasizes being safe, e.g. safe sex, and discouragement of drug use or allowing strangers into one's home. However, it was written in 2014 (published in 2015) before same-sex marriage was legalized in the US and is dated, especially with regard to the trans community (as noted by other reviewers). Thankfully, there's a lot more LGBTQ+ representation in books and movies now, and I suspect there are a lot more LGBTQ+ people who have children.Why is it banned? The language is pretty graphic, especially when describing how to have gay sex. It can be shocking to us 60+ year olds who grew up in a different time. However, I seriously doubt if there are kids in the age group for which it was written who have never heard that kind of language before. All one has to do is listen in on a group of middle schoolers.At one point, Dawson says, ""By all means, enjoy sex, but if you go looking for sex because you're hungry for love, you'll starve.""

It basically calls itself out in the forward. Since these things are typically not taught in school and kids are probably asking these kinds of questions, it seems pretty useful to me.Where I think this book could do better: Inclusivity based on race. The author is white, no shame in sharing that viewpoint That said, the more labels you put on a group of people, the more likely these individuals, will be ostracized by people in power who are outside that group. People of color traditionally have more barriers to overcome anyway, so LGBTQ+ individuals who are also people of color would have even more. If there is another iteration of this book, I think devoting a chapter might be very helpful to members within that circle of influence and some of the unique challenges they experience.

This book is in Irish (as well as some English, Scottish and Welsh) schools and libraries in the ""young adult section"" (ages 12-18) yet the book gives a positive account of a boy (on his 16th birthday) starting a sexual relationship with an older, married man, who owns a music shop he frequents which while just within the age of consent being a shop owner of a shop a young person frequents gives them (some) power over that individual, much less than a teacher for example, though ""you can have this for free"" and ""do this or you're barred from the shop"" may still have an effect on a 16 year old. The book talks about using apps such as Grindr, which is an app designed for people aged 18 and over, not children aged 13-17. A book like this, in the section of libraries, book shops and school libraries that talks about quick hookups on sex apps, is grooming. The book encourages young people to visit gay bathhouses and saunas, so long as they wear a condom, which doesn't protect against genital warts or genital herpes, it even states ""wear two"" which while adults may take this as a joke, this may be taken as actual advice, wearing two condoms INCREASES the chances of getting an STD due to friction between them causing them to break, or come off, so it fails on basic sex safety. Additionally some gay bathhouses and saunas may not ask for ID, so directing young readers there is absolutely inappropriate. Instead of going over the birds and the bees in a matter of fact way, as many young adult books do, this book goes into pornographic detail, with detailed descriptions on how to perform handjobs on other people with lines like ""You shouldn't shake his todger like a bottle of ketchup"" and goes into very explicit detail on how to perform oral sex with lines such as ""just pop his peen into your mouth, or pop yours into his"" ""You want to suck, but don't try and suck his kidneys out of his urethra"", talks about how anal sex is painful but ""good, like a deep muscle massage"" that you will need lube, ""not spit, like in brokeback mountain"". [age rating 18 ] and that ""All men like things in their bums, even straight men"". Though at least it states to use water based lubricant.It goes on to explain, in great detail, that before anal sex the person being penetrated (the ""bottom"") should go for a poo and use a douche to clean out ""the back passage"" since ""the primary function of the back passage is to do poos"" however it does NOT mention that prolonged anal sex can cause irreparable damage due to wall of the rectum being significantly thinner and less elastic than the wall of the vagina. This can cause prolapse, anal fissures, rectal tearing and serious infection, fecal incontinence (after roughly five years of regular anal sex) and potentially even cancer. It gives equally detailed explanations of how women can pleasure eachother, saying that ""A hand is as good as five penises"", which underscores the fact that this isn't sex education, it's a manual on how to sexually pleasure someone, aimed at 12-18 year old people. For example, in the gay girls part on sex (written by a lesbian woman) it states ""I think all good orgasms revolve around the clit, well for me and mine anyway! If you want to get a bit fancy there's nothing wrong with a few fingers inside (or a hand depending on, well, y'know)"" or ""Something in your arse, withdrawn shortly before orgasm can feel AMAZING for some people""Furthermore it talks about S&M in the female section, talking about physiological S&M (being forced to eat using your left hand) or how the female co-writer liked to have her girlfriend publicly flog her at ""club fuk"" which, again, isn't a topic that should be discussed in a sex education book for people under 18. Compare this to similar books that I had read as a young adult (albeit, for straight people) and the books were very matter of fact, clinical and scientific. Not about how best to pleasure your partner, because that goes outside the realm of simply educating people about sexual intercourse and into the realm of erotica. When I was 16-18 I managed to find online PDFs of some books that went into more detail for straight people, however these wouldn't have been in my school library, or even my local public library. I wouldn't have read books like at from age 12-16, even though this book falls well within this age bracket. All throughout the language and images are designed to be child friendly, such as ""I thought bumming meant two men bouncing their bottoms together"" with an accompanying image, which definitely reinforces the young (very young, around age 12-13, or younger) of the young adult scale, unless the reader is very sheltered. Giving accounts of someone entering into a sexual relationship on their 16th birthday encourages the reader to become sexually active as soon as it is legal, at the very least, since throughout the entire sex section which I skimmed through, I've found no real mention of age differences (eg a sixteen year old child and older person) being an issue or really any mention of legal age of consent at all.

It's easy to read and all of the subjects it touches upon are broken down explained in an uncomplicated manner. This makes it ideal for young people who are getting to know themselves and who haven't gotten anyone to talk to about their queerness, or for older cis-heteros who haven't really had any contact to the subject yet.That being said, this book only brushes upon the bare bones of what it means to be LGBT+, and leaves a lot to be wanted for. For example, I think if an individual did not truly understand the difference between sex and gender they would be no wiser after reading this book, despite the fact that the author herself is trans. It is useful to introduce newbies to some of the base concepts, but if you are really interested in learning more about LGBT+ subjects, this is really the book I would recommend.Despite all of that it is still a fun and easy read, and I am sure there are many young people that this book will help.Show more"

I did not agree with how much Dawson pushed ""coming out,"" especially because it can be dangerous or unsafe for some people, and it's a personal choice that takes planning (Trans+ deals with this in a very balanced way IMO).I was frustrated with how Dawson off-handedly mentions ace or aro people, but then ignores them for the rest of the book. As someone who is largely invisible (ace, aro-flux, gender-queer) and fears being gate-kept (and gate-keeps myself) it was frustrating to be erased and feel invisible in a queer book. UGH.So.

I got this book from a local queer owned bookstore, because I'd seen it was targeted for bans a lot recently, and I'm half convinced the ones trying to ban this book were literally only doing it to pretect queer youth. If you're a cishet gay man who doesn't care about trans/nonbinary folk or lesbians, maaaybe this book could be up your alley, but much of what the author says is actively harmful to trans persons, potentially dangerous to WLW, and nevermind the asexuals and enby folks... Because aside from mentioning them once at the beginning, never again. Especially concerning considering the author is a trans woman, I think this book lends a ton of credence to transphobic ideas, and actively ignores and discredits those who love trans people. I'm going to list my problems with this book by page, but tbh, the problems certainly weren't only on the pages I'm listing, I would certainly not recommend this book.P21 sexuality to the author is totally a preference. Okayyy.... Then conversion therapy should work? If it's just a preference, people should just choose to not be gay/trans. It'd be sooo much easier. Alright book can stop here! P30 is the first mention of ace folks, the second and final mention is on page 244, and the rest of the book almost seems to forget them. I'd argue this could be fleshed out a bit to help people realize they're ace and that their are different ways to be ace, that don't all necessarily preclude being sexual with specific people (while not necessarily being interested in sex as a general concept.) The author then says that she's noticed a lot of teens identifying as ace, and of course theirs nothing wrong with that and this could change over time... Of course it could, but holy ugh. This gave me maybe you can change their mind on it, it's just a phase vibe. P31 I'm a trans woman, and the way this book decided to list the types of us ""trans"" was uh... Decidedly archaic and gross tbh. Alright, so what have we got, you got your transgenders... This is the umbrella term. Cool, good. This is the modern and respectful way to refer to us. Let's see what's next... The transsexuals? Oh no. We doing the trans medical separation thing? I guess, since later on in the book, we see the author laud a notable transmedicalist. Transsexual is a very archaic term, and honestly should only be used by people self identifying as such, generally it'll be older trans folk who do so, and that's okay. Transvestite - a cross dresser. Again. We don't use this term often anymore. Self identifying is fine as such but honestly, separating these out is weird... And then the last type of the transes are the drag queens and kings. Juuuust no. Drag queens/kings are cis people, albeit those who play with gender roles pretty hard, they do not fall under the trans umbrella. Gender identity and expression are extremely different things. Trans people are those whose gender identity don't align with their gender the doctors yelled out when they were born, based off a cursory glance at the genitals. Wait, but nonbinary people have an identity different from their assigned gender... Why are we putting them in a totally different category? Ofc, transmedicalist folk think enbys are just faking it, but dang. Come on, nonbinary people are trans, by definition, even if they aren't transsexual-transvestite-crossdresser-dragqueens. Just yikes. This one section gave me so much yikes that I almost put the book down here, buuut I guess I like hurting?P74 this is in the section on deconstruction of stereotypes. Lesbians are manhaters, that's not true, as the author says, and then she talks about how this is similar to what response one gets when calling oneself a feminist. Okay, yeah, that's a problem that happens, and while that's more of a second wave separatist stereotype... Sure. But don't worry, the next paragraph makes sure to ""not all men"" us just a little bit. She says when talking about women's issue ""men"" is often conflated with ""the patriarchy"", and that this is a mistake. Sorry sorry, yes, men are also hurt by the patriarchy, but the primary beneficiaries of the patriarchy are men, and they do most benefit from upholding patriarchal standards, so occasionally people will conflate the two terms, but certainly it's not an all men issue. Intersectionality covers this, and I'd recommend more people who want to learn about feminism learn about Intersectionality theory. We're all oppressed for various aspects of our selves, and though men tend to benefit from being men under the patriarchy (while also being oppressed by it and its archaic rules of what it is to be a man), men can be oppressed for multiple other aspects of themselves. UghAlso P74 reminds us that cis lesbians can't be with pre/no op trans women, (sorry to my partner who thought she was a lesbian - ya can't be). Because lesbians like vaginas (and let's not forget the trans men as this author so often seems to do, to the terfy lesbians, it's okay to fawn over those poor misguided butch lesbians stolen by trans ideology, but if they still have their vag, you can have at them!). The author seems to forget that she said that genitalia doesn't define gender, but uh... How then do we relate this?P102 - we need more studies to understand trans youth's risk for suicide. Omg. This book was re-released in 2019 (and thank heavens I got this edition, I've heard the first edition is waaay more transphobic, but I guess since the author is trans now, we had to remove summa that), there's been maaany studies re:trans youth. Not just one, omg. This is just a huge and harmful omission, trans youth are significantly more likely to consider or attempt suicide. Having affirming families/getting the care they need is extremely helpful in reducing those feelings. Not as relevant to my complaint here since at the time this book was published, the study hadnt been done, but recent studies have even shown the efficacy of puberty blockers in reducing suicidal thoughts vs trans youth who didn't receive them. Makes sense to me, going through the wrong puberty was exceedingly horrifying, and if I had the words to express/understand myself back then, I'm sure my pubescent years wouldn't have been nearly as emo as they ended up being. P148 talking about coming out, in the subsection called ""is it safe""? The author says ""do you live in... One of the eightyish countries where you might be locked up or stoned to death? Look into getting a passport.""... Immediately following this up with ""Joking aside"" is extremely distasteful considering people are literally being murdered throughout the world just for being gay. P156 I really hope this Irene, 33, actively identifies as a ""transsexual"" because that's such a dated term, as I said earlier. P166 ""As discussed, being transgender has nothing to do with a person's sexuality, transvestites, transsexuals and drag queens have often sought refuge from gawkers in gay...clubs - not ideal but theyre an accepting place"" what were you getting at here, author? The T in LGBT stands for trans. This IS our community. Why wouldn't clubs for our community be an ideal place?? P167 a note from another person was ""I'd see all these people cross-dressing at gay pride events or big butch lesbians...and very camp gay men dancing around and I'd be like 'I'm not like that. I don't want to have to cut my hair short and spend the whole time talking about dildos and telling everyone about my sex life'""... This felt like an extremely toxic way to compartmentalize the rest of the ""bad gays"" away from the writers self. Wow, I'm glad you're not like us stereotypical cross dressing f*gs, good for you? P178 we get a story from a MTF trans girl (btw, no, we don't need to establish what the person ""used to be"", that's irrelevant. She's a trans girl, M there is just like an asterisk saying HEY THIS TRANS GIRL WAS A MAN, WATCH OUT), where she has a cis lesbian partner she's friends with, who helps her throughout her transition, and eventually they develop romantic feelings for eachother over time. I thought lesbians only liked vagina? This poor cis lesbian was tricked! P173 ""Some establishments are for cross dressers, transsexuals, and transvestites"" ... Wait, didn't you define transvestites (ew) as cross dressers on page 31?190 Re:trans dating. ""this is complicated. Clearly a trans person can also be gay or bi,...,but some trans people will identify as straight."" in this section, the author doesn't clarify what any of this means. Let me do it for her. Straight trans women date men, straight trans men date women. Trans women who are gay are lesbians (transbians if they prefer) and date women. Trans men who are gay are gay, and date men. 221 talking about STIs, and uhhh, don't worry women, you aren't likely to get them if you're gay, so we aren't going to talk about that so much. (just put condoms on your toys if you want to pretend to be safe)251 talking about ""gaybies"" and ""this might shock you but two men or two women need help with making babies"". Again, trans people do exist, and while some of the effects of HRT CAN lead to sterilization, that's not a guarantee, and its one of the many things a healthcare provider will discuss with a trans patient pre transition (there are definitely ways to maintain fertility). But instead of hearing any job that, author completely omits that couples with at least one trans (including enbies, but we know those aren't real) partner are completely able to make babies on their own. 253 oh wait nevermind, the author remembers trans people, the end of this section was ""two loving parents=two great parents regardless of sexual preference or gender identity""... Well I guess she just mentions them when convenient? Idk. Lastly, was the list of gay idols. I certainly don't know all of these names, but in particular, two of the idols mentioned by the author are extremely hateful of trans people. On P269 buck angel is a transmedicalist who thinks trans women are predators, and thinks nonbinary people are made up. Gay saint? Yikes. 277 Martina Navratilova was one of the first out as a lesbian tennis stars. You'd think her perspective of being considered a predator for being a lesbian in the sport would give her a little empathy towards trans women who are being villainized just as she was (and I'm willing to talk for days about that argument, since most of the arguments against anti trans women in sports roll back to misogyny; because of course, when have people ever cared about women's sports except to make fun of them?)This book made me mad, tbh. It's upsetting enough seeing transphobia taking a central roll in politics throughout the world because conservatives always need an enemy to blame (can't actually help people with politics), but to get it from within the community, and even worse, from a trans woman? It hurts. Book banning is wrong, and this book certainly shouldn't have been banned, but it makes me wonder, were the people who banned this just trying to keep me safe? The updated version certainly sounds better, but there is sooo much room for improvement.Show more"

This book is gay claims to be the instruction manual you need to navigate life as a queer person. It really isn’t. Honestly, there are much better ones out there. I’ve never recommended another book in a review before, but I’ll make an exception: The ABC’s of LGBT+ by Ash Hardell is great, and much more inclusive (and there’s even a free e-book version online!) Inclusivity is really where This Book Is Gay falls short. The book talks a big game about embracing the diversity within the LGBT+ community (the author uses LGBT*, and we’ll get back to that later), but in reality, it’s only about gay, lesbian, bi, and trans folk, with a focus on gay men. At the time of writing the book, the author identified as a gay man (she’s later come out as a trans woman), and I understand the instinct to write what you know. If the introduction said: ‘I’ll try to cover more topics, but I’m writing from the perspective of a cis gay man and therefore will focus on that’, I wouldn’t have as much of a problem with it. But it’s the fact that the book claims to cover more than it actually does that is a problem, because it gives readers false expectations.There are a few parts where Dawson really shows that she doesn’t really consider any other identities/labels than gay, bi, lesbian, and trans to be of much importance: “being L or G or B or T or * is SUPER FUN.” Page 51: “identifying as LGB or T or * means (…)”. I’m sorry, but I’ve never met anyone who identifies as an asterix, and until I do, I’m going to call this a weak attempt to include ‘all those other complicated identities.’ Dawson herself says that the asterix is added to LGBT to “represent the full spectrum of sexualities and identities”, but this doesn’t actually help if you never really acknowledge other identities than straight, gay, lesbian, bi, queer, and trans. Dawson uses a lot of language that is shaming towards ace, aro, polyamorous people ++, and some kinda transphobic language as well. (I don’t think that the author is/was transphobic, but you can still say/do transphobic things). Dawson continuously uses ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ interchangeably and equates genitalia to gender (the way to check that a gay man isn’t “a girl” is to check if he has a penis, apparently). Non-binary people are completely forgotten about after the introduction, and the author sticks to a binary view on gender. In the ‘cheat sheet’ at the back of the book, ‘cisgender’ is defined as “the sex you were assigned at birth”, which is just wrong. In the same cheat sheet, ‘asexuality’ is defined as “a person who is not interested in sex or has low sexual desire”, which also isn’t a great definition and excludes probably most ace people. On page 210, we also find the lovely quote: “However, all people - gay or otherwise - must recognize that there is one universal truth of the universe: WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE”. I don’t think I need to get into why that is wrong. The tiny section about asexuality also implies that it’s mostly just an adolescent phase… Lovely. The author keeps insisting that being queer is either about “changing genders” or wanting to have sex with someone of the same gender/sex. Actual children identify as gay; please don’t make it all about sex. (Also, ace people exist, as previously mentioned.)There are also just rude statements?? Like this, on page 61: “NO ONE WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH A BALD SPOTTY PSYCHO WITH BALLS LIKE SHRIVELLED RAISINS.” Yeah, I get the psycho part, but was there really any reason to shame people who are bald, spotty, and have small balls? Also this lovely advice about online dating: “If you don’t give your age, weight, and height, people will assume you’re old, fat, and tiny.” WTF??? “Not many people look like [porn stars] in real life, and you probably wouldn’t want to hang out with those who did.” WHY NOT?This Book Is Gay isn’t the worst thing I’ve ever read. However, it’s not great, and I don’t recommend it for anyone who’s not a gay cis man (and maybe not even for them, because I’d rather people read something more inclusive). I respect Juno Dawson and what she tried to do with this book, but I don’t think she was the right person to write a book like this. Her narration is funny and fitting for this kind of book, but that’s not enough. My copy is now filled with post-it notes, annotations, and several WTFs scribbled in margins. Show more"

I wrote this review before that, so my pronoun usage and statement of the author's identity (as stated in this book) are now outdated. I'm excited to read her new book specifically about the trans and non-binary experience.Update/Plot Twist 2: I also came out as Non-binary since I wrote this review! XD This author, Elliot Page, and I seem to be going through a similar transitional process.]The day I realized I wasn't straight, I pulled a Hermione Granger and went to the library to look up what I could about LGBT stuff. Unfortunately, in my tiny, conservative town, what little there was on the subject was mostly scientific studies about ""homosexuality"" and other vague or negative sort of references to the whole thing. I did most of my learning when I went to college, but I was surprised to find this book on display in my hometown when I came back a few years later. Progress!This is exactly the sort of book that would have been nice to find that day I came out to myself. It covers a lot of the basics, and is really good for a person of any gender identity or sexual orientation, including cisgender and straight allies.Despite being written by a white, gay, cisgender man, it did a relatively good job of being inclusive of information about different religious beliefs about LGBT issues, the laws of different countries worldwide, and about the issues of more than just the cis gay men in the community. He interviewed hundreds of people across the spectrum and included many of their quotes into the chapters to flesh out the sections he didn't have personal experience with, which I appreciated.I did knock off a star for some places where he sort of tactlessly messed a couple of things up, such as putting in diagrams of people with vaginas and saying they were women and people with penises being men, without elaborating that the genital=>gender thing wasn't wholly accurate since there are trans men without penises and vice versa. There was also a part where he said ""WE ALL LOVE SEX"" which wasn't very inclusive of people on the asexual spectrum, despite his brief informing of the asexual community being a part of LGBT*. And there were some places in the sex chapter where he would write ""There's only a couple of solid rules here: "" and then he neglected to include a conversation about consent, perhaps assuming that should go without saying, despite it being a terribly important thing to teach about if he's truly trying to present the LGBT equivalent of what Sex Ed should teach everyone.But all in all, I still think it was a great read to get people started when they have no idea about the subject, and I'm glad it exists. I hope it makes its way into many more libraries to educate the lost and curious.Show more"

Thank goodness for that! This is a frank and humorous look at sexuality across the LGBT* spectrum that is surely a godsend to teenagers in today’s world who are confused or curious about their gender preference and even as a heterosexual female, I found this book to be an entertaining and fact-filled journey where there is always something to be learned.James Dawson is brutally honest about the fact that despite his experience in sex education for youngsters he is by no means a complete expert, he just talks about what he knows. I’ve read some reviews on this book and the main criticism seems to be that he doesn’t really explore other types of sexuality, for example asexual and pan-sexual preferences. Yes, this is the case but sexuality in general is such a huge topic and I feel if he was to explore everything in detail the book would lose something of its undeniable charm.Most of the information I read I was aware of before but I was also surprised to learn a few things as well. There are also certain things I have a mental image of thanks to James that I don’t think I will be able to get rid of for a while! e.g. how to pleasure a man – DO NOT shake it like a tomato ketchup bottle! The author also covers a wide variety of topics from how to come out and the ins and outs of gay sex to gay icons and stereotypes. The most important message he covers through the novel however is that it’s okay to be yourself, to be unique and to fancy whoever floats your boat be that man, woman or both. This is a fantastic statement to send to all teenagers as we all remember how tough adolescence is, regardless of sexuality and I have to applaud James Dawson for this.As well as this, the author provides testimonials from real teenagers across the globe as they talk about their own experiences with sexuality. And if this wasn’t enough, a comprehensive list of places to go to for more information, phone numbers and websites is provided at the end of the book so people can make use of the services that are provided but perhaps little known about. Finally, the illustrations by Spike Gerrell which accompany James’ hilarious and honest text are just the icing on the cake and provided quite a few laugh out loud moments for myself and the people that I immediately thrust this book upon. I highly recommend this book for anyone curious about sexuality and especially for those struggling teenagers out there. It’s a hugely important read that I can only hope will be stocked in school libraries and be referred to in sex education classes for years to come.For my full review please see my blog at http://www.bibliobeth.comShow more"

First of all, I feel like there were many conflicting statements. There would be one statement, and then chapters later there would be something that contradicted it. For example, it was claimed that LGBT people are rarely seen in the media, but then stated that people might be inspired to come out when they see/hear about LGBT individuals on TV which is constantly happening. It was also claimed that being trans is ""being born in the wrong body"", but then it stated later that being trans is a choice/preference and can change daily. I distinctly remember the phrase ""changing your gender"", which just doesn't seem correct or very sensitive. Overall, I was not fond of how being LGBT was referred to as a ""preference""; I don't really know why. The last major contradiction I had a problem with was how in the coming out chapter, sexuality/gender identity are referred to as central factors of someone's personhood (and that's why coming out is so important/a big deal/monumentally liberating), but then in the last chapter, the book emphasizes that being LGBT is ""just a little bit"" of a person's life and it's just one of many personality traits, likening sexuality to hobbies. Other than the contradictions, some parts of this book were just spreading bad messages. In the section on online dating, the book says ""If you don't give your age, weight, and height, people will assume you're old, fat, and tiny."" I have never in my life seen a dating profile that included someone's weight, and only a fraction include their height. Yeah, not including your age can be sketchy, but nothing gives anyone the right to assume things about you, especially such shallow things. Or maybe you dodge a bullet when they don't match with you because you're too ""old, fat, and tiny.""Two stars because I still liked the author's voice. The content was told in a funny and creative way, and in some ways the book did open my eyes to things I didn't consider before. Show more"

It’s awful. The book makes all kinds of awful assumptions about peoples sex drives, basically insinuating all everyone wants to have sex. This is way wrong. Not everyone does, dear Author. It basically erases anyone who’s asexual, which the book mentioned (very briefly.) it also didn’t talk about hetero/homo/bi/panromantic (etc) people. (People who only experience romantic attraction). Overall there was a lot of erasure in this book. It basically glossed over bi, pan, intersex, trans, and non binary people. If you’re not a gay man, you’ll probably not find this book relatable. It feels like a white twink standing at the head of a pride parade float acting like the window to the lgbtq worldSecond problem: everything it says about religion. I’m Jewish, and my family attends an orthodox chabad. And let me say this: they give no shits about who you want to marry as long as you act nice and compliment the homemade babka. But this book basically outright says that Jews are the source of religious homophobia due to some crusty bible passages and makes it seem like reform Jews are the only good ones. This is anti Semitism wrapped up in a rainbow colored passage. Of course there are homophobic Jews, but this book makes it seem like we’re the reason gays are oppressed. This book also seems to defend the Qurans very obvious homophobic passages and pins the religious blame on Judaism, as if Israel doesn’t host one of the biggest pride parades every year and most middle eastern countries DON’T yeet gay and trans people off buildings. Overall? Steaming, rainbow colored incorrect puddle. Not worth your time!(Also it lists David Bowie as bi, when he explicitly stated he was heterosexual)Show more"

The term of LGBT* was unfamiliar and awkward to me. I would be lying if I said that I didn't afraid of her or having some bad prejudices against her. Growing up in a very religious country, where such thing like sex or LGBT* are completely taboo, made my knowledge about the community is very narrow. And yes, in my country, gay people are very discriminated, though according to the law, it's completely legal to have a same-sex relationship. The people in my country are just not ready to accept the idea of LGBT* community, since they are under a big influence of religion beliefs and teachings (my country is one of the biggest islamic countries and there are 5 religions with big number of followers). Most of the gay people prefer not come out to the community, since people could get very aggressive and tempramental about the idea of someone being gay. During my exchange year she and I became close friends. She told me a lot about who LGBT* people really are, how it feels to be a member of LGBT* community and how she's sometimes discriminated. Hearing her stories made me realize that I mustn't be the only one who knows nothing about LGBT* people or has bad stereotypes against them and more people should be educated about this. Children shoudn't be taught that being gay or transgender is something shameful and we have to respect them. They are as human as we are. I've been more opened and concerned about LGBT* topics since I met her and reading this book really expands my knowledge and awareness. If you haven't read this book, please do.

Dawson focuses primarily on gays and lesbians with some polite nods to bi folks and a rather watered-down discussion of trans people that doesn't really acknowledge how they intersect with the LGB community (or the transphobic ideas that often run rampant in the LGB community). There's no talk whatsoever of gender-nonconforming folks and only a couple of brief mentions of pansexuality/asexuality that don't give nearly enough information on the orientation. (On top of that, Dawson incorrectly defines bisexuality as attraction to men and women when it's actually been defined by the bi community as attraction to one's same gender and to other genders. A common mistake (whenever I come out as bi to someone, I always define it for them because I want people to have the correct understanding of my identity), but you're writing a book about queer people. Please double-check your definitions.)That being said, Dawson's tone is affirming and he does a nice job at debunking stereotypes (although he does imply that all LGBT+ folks enjoy sex, which isn't necessarily true for someone who's on the asexual spectrum [which I also am, which is why it stuck out to me and annoyed me]). His information is solid, if limited, and I could see this being a valuable starting point for teens questioning their gender/sexual orientation.If you're looking to educate yourself primarily on (cisgender) homosexual relationships, this is an excellent place to start and is written with a pleasant and accessible tone. However, if you're looking for something a bit more inclusive, look elsewhere.Show more"

It provides an outsider, a heterosexual cis male, such as myself a glimpse into the world of the LGBT community. LGBT people have faced persecution for long periods of times and after reading this book, it just confirms how stupid or idiotic it is for the majority to condemn their way of life. Yes, we may not agree with what they do at home, but why does it matter? If it doesn't harm us it shouldn't bother us. There are many heterosexual cis people who do far more sinister things that harm our society; Look at the wall street crash of 2008, wars being started, drugs being dealt that harm our communities. Which is worse? Two people of the same gender getting intimate or losing money you worked for/ losing your life because your home is being destroyed in a war conflict. I am all for letting people live their life just as along as they don't intrude on my personal liberty. Plus this book helps LGBT people learn the ropes of coming out, dealing with bullying, and navigating life as a LGBT person. Definitely worth reading. Being religious shouldn't stop you. I'm religious and found seeing things from a different POV worthwhile. To all the LGBT people out there, best of luck to you in your life journey.Show more"

It is written in a very informal, friendly and fun style, so it’s perfect for very young teenagers, who will find this book helpful and relevant to them.However, it can be an informative read for people of all ages, especially as it includes a detailed look at the current scientific theories and research behind sexuality. That section in particular contained a lot of information I didn’t know, and it was definitely worth reading. While the title implies the book is about gay people only, it also gives information on all parts of the LGBT+ spectrum. It can be quite simplistic at times, which I think is a good thing, as this is supposed to be an introduction to the LGBT+ community rather than an ‘advanced manual’. The actual sex education portion of the book is very carefully handled, in a way that won’t be shocking for either younger teenagers or parents. While it can get a bit conversational in tone at times, I think this fills a much needed gap in the market.

Which is great for anyone who identifies as that, but not so much for anyone else.I think the best part were the testimonials - I thought it was lovely, and sometimes heartbreaking, to read these first hand experiences.I felt like there were times that the 'light-hearted humour' approach missed the mark (I read some reviews from people who said they found the author offensive).

It's meant to be a sort of guide for those who just came out of the closet.Nice idea. Fun, cute, illustrated. But it's also kind of basic and shallow. Not necessarily a bad thing, but for that reason I mainly just skimmed through the book and didn't really get much out of it.A complaint about historySomething I must mention: I encountered a glaring historical error at one point, presented as fact, and that made me take the whole thing less seriously. I'm not going to trust your research abilities when you essentially say that the ancient world was not homophobic until Christianity came along (?!). That is....... an over-simplification, at best.The Ancient Greeks, for example, celebrated homoeroticism, but because they were deeply misogynistic, the only acceptable form of same-sex love was between a grown man and a boy, NOT two adult men. Why? Because being on the ""receiving"" end of sex was considered unmanly. Suitable only for children, and for women, who they basically thought of as... being like children. Cool!Soooooo don't go around saying that everything was fine and dandy until Christianity spread throughout the globe. Lol, at that. Sure, Christianity has been probably one of the most influential sources of homophobia in the world, but it's not the only one.On the controversy surrounding this bookThere always has to be a controversy, doesn't there? Ughhh... well, here are my thoughts.This Book Is Gay is a pretty accurate title. It's gay; it's not really very bi or trans, much less queer in any other sense. It's most useful and relatable to people in the four letters LGBT, and especially to the first two letters.I'm rolling my eyes at all the reviews on Goodreads for this book that complain about this as if it's a TERRIBLE PROBLEM. How DARE a book called ""This Book Is Gay"" be mostly about gay stuff!!!Honestly people, you need to freaking relax. A single book doesn't have to be for everyone. And the author himself is a cis gay man, so is it really so abhorrent that he'd up writing a lot from his own perspective? He makes a lot of simplistic statements, i.e. talking about lesbians liking vagina (when there are lesbians who are cool with trans women that may have different anatomy), and sure that's not 100% perfectly accurate. But at the same time, IT'S MOST OFTEN TRUE. Probably most lesbians do like vagina, okay? Just because someone doesn't take the time to list every exception to a commonality doesn't mean what they're saying isn't true, on some level. It's just a generality. Besides, he even has a disclaimer at the beginning of the book, admitting that the book won't necessarily reflect everyone's experiences. And I quote:""My experience as a gay, white man is not representative of every gay man, let alone the thousands of gay women, bisexual men and women, and trans people who may be reading this book. Therefore, before writing this book, I searched far and wide for dozens of other LGBT* people to share their experiences with you...""I haven't edited or changed the testimonies of the LGBT* people in this book, so you might not identify or agree with everything they have to say, AND THAT'S FINE. We have to be able to talk about sexuality and identity in a nonhysterical way. Sexuality and gender are individual experiences; people are entitled to opinions and, vitally, we need to be able to make mistakes. I understand identity is an issue that some people feel very strongly about. This is also a good thing--activism is what got us this far--but if people aren't allowed to say what's really on their minds for fear of upsetting people, we'll end up never saying anything at all.""The purity tests that the LGBTQ+ community require of each other can be ridiculous. That's another topic for another time, but yikes it's annoying.This book does not, at any point, claim to be anything other than a book for gay people (with bi and trans people somewhat tacked on).

I pro TEBE.“ – to se píše v anotaci a zní to parádně… problém je, že  knížka není pro každého, vlastně je jen pro gaye nebo lesby. Autorka sice na začátku píše, že knížka je pro všechny (LGBTQIA+ komunitu i lidi, kteří prostě chtějí vědět víc), ale to platí tak pro prvních pár stran, protože zbytek knížky je psaný z 90 % pro gaye a lesby a i tak je plná problematických věcí. Problém je, že knížka má jen 280 stran, a autorka se věnuje až moc tématům – kromě vysvětlení na začátku knihy (co např. znamená být nebinární nebo asexuální), se autorka věnuje vlastně jen gayům a lesbám, což není vůbec nic špatného… jenže knížka slibuje mnohem víc. Navíc je tam dost  problematických pasáží  – pár příkladů: - Hned začátku píše, že „Někdy by si muž / žena přál(a) být ženou / mužem“ (str. 6) – od transgender osoby bych čekala, že chápe, že nikdo si nepřeje být druhým pohlavím, jen si přejí být tak bráni.- „Všichni chceme mít sex se spoustou lidí. (Pokud teda nejste asexuál. To je jasný.) (str. 216) – musím k tomu vůbec něco psát?!? - Argumentace grafem, který nemá žádnou hodnotu, protože se autorka „jen“ zeptala 100 lidí (str. 12 a 13) – když chcete argumentovat čísly, tak to chce víc než se jen zeptat některých lidí…- „Na reprezentaci záleží: jelikož jen málokteří LGBTQ herci dostanou možnost hrát LGBTQ postavy v Hollywoodu, znamená to, že málo LGBTQ lidí v zábavním průmyslu mělo šanci dosáhnout stejného úspěchu a vlivu jako jejich cis hetero protějšky.“ (str. 81) – je to hraní, herec nemusí být gay, aby ho hrál, a pokud někdo začne prosazovat myšlenku, že jen gay může hrát gaye, tak se to může rychle obrátit proti komunitě, protože proč by pak měl gay hrát hetero muže? - Rady, co dělat, když jste šikanováni (což se týká každého) – opravdu není dobré radit, aby si oběť psala vše (jména, místo, svědci…) do deníku, tohle totiž není žádný důkaz… to si může napsat kdokoli, takže tvrdit, že „S vaším deníkem (svědky) nebude možné moc diskutovat“ je opravdu hloupé (str. 90)- Nebo i taková „blbost“ jako, že „pokud jste si dali něco k jídlu a váš partner začne do puntíku přepočítávat, kolik kdo dluží, okamžitě se ho zbavte“ (str. 168) – tohle je tak hloupá rada, protože ne každý má tolik peněz… navíc kdo z nás by chtěl platit účet na půl (nebo dokonce celý účet), když si toho záměrně dal málo a druhý hodně? - Celá pasáž o náboženství (str, 104-118) – to bylo celé fakt mimo… (…)Tím  nechci říct, že je knížka celá špatná – to vůbec, je tam spousta dobrých pasáží, ale celé je to takové meh… nemůžu mluvit za LGBTQIA+ komunitu, ale pokud do ní nepatříte, tak se vám knížka s největší pravděpodobností líbit nebude, protože místy je autorka až moc útočná vůči lidem mimo tuto komunitu (což prostě člověk, který se snaží a chce se dozvědět víc, číst nechce).Nápad je to vážně dobrý – napsat knížku o celé komunitě a všem podstatném je ALE velký úkol a do necelých 300 stran se to nikdy vejít nebude. Na druhou stranu tvrdit, že knížka je pro všechny, když není? To už moc hezké není, zvláště když se přidá, že některé pasáže v knize jsou hodně problematické - i tak si ale myslím, že knížka nemusí být úplně ten nejhorší způsob, jak zjistit něco málo o LGBTQIA+ komunitě, pokud k ní čtenář bude přistupovat aspoň trochu kriticky.Co si ale zaslouží  velkou pochvalu  (a tu jednu hvězdičku, kterou knížce dávám)  je Olga Xaverová , tedy česká překladatelka, která text doplnila o informace relevantní pro české čtenáře – tedy jak to u nás chodí, stejně jako odkazy na různé organizace působící u nás… díky tomu si čtenář odnese z knížky aspoň něco.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3737366-rai,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"December 17, 2023",1 like,0,"I'll start by saying that if you're asexual/are questioning if you're asexual, just don't bother with this book. I'm surprised that a book published in 2021 would still have an inaccurate definition of asexuality in it. Aside from that, it focuses on gayness as a largely sexual aspect of one's identity, so it probably won't benefit anyone not feeling that. Additionally, the book skews heavily toward white gay male experiences, so if that's not you, you might find it lacking (as an example, the author describes bears, cubs, otters, twinks, muscle marys, and scallies when it comes to gay men, but can only think of butches and femmes when it comes to lesbian subcultures).Despite the author being trans as of the new and revised edition, the book is also not very trans inclusive overall. Maybe it's because I'm not a teen, but I found all the attempts at teen-speak really cringe and somewhat patronizing. But who knows, maybe this is what teens like? I also found that due to this, serious issues tend to be trivialized. Think something like ""in some countries, you can even be sentenced to death for being gay. Major sad face."" I really wasn't impressed with the tone of the book, but if you're looking for something that generally leans lighthearted, even if it's not fully accurate, this could be the book for you. I will applaud this book for having more gay sex ed information than you'll ever get in schools (at least based on my experiences). Initially, this was why I picked up the book, because I heard this was a major positive feature for many people. Unfortunately, I also found this lacking. While I applaud the book's advice to not base your sex education on porn (because it features professional actors), I would have then preferred if it went into more detail about how to actually safely perform gay or lesbian sex (you know, so that porn isn't the only example people have for the... ins and outs, as it were). The lesbian section is particularly lacking, where the author brings in the writer Fi Locke to consult. It's basically just a rant about Locke's own personal preferences. Safe sex advice basically boils down to ""always wear a condom"", without any explanation of safe sex options available to gay women. For something that is meant to fill in where school sex ed classes fail, I found it was very disappointing, but again, better than absolutely nothing. Also, I found it weird that the glossary in the back gives a (sort of inaccurate) definition of poppers, but the safety and use of these is not discussed in the sex ed section itself. The section on trans dating was really out of touch, basically just saying that you won't have any problems because everyone dating you will already know you're trans, so therefore will be completely ok with it--I think we all know that this is not the case. I found the section of ""gay icons"" at the back pretty cute, and this book did have some good advice in some parts. I'm not exactly the target demographic now, but I can tell you that as a teen I would not have liked this book due to the flippant nature of the writing style. However, not all teen/young adult readers are the same. This book also unfortunately skews in favour of western societies being gay/trans havens as opposed to the global south (and Russia), and gives advice accordingly. Sadly as we see more and more attacks on queer rights and queer lives in the US, UK, and Canada (including the banning of this very book!), this attitude is currently inaccurate. I'm glad this book was written, and I think especially when it was first published it filled a need. But I think if you're looking for a book these days, you're better off looking for a more modern and inclusive take on the issue (which is unfortunate, since the revised edition is only from 2021!)

It emphasizes that it is okay for everyone to be who they are, and that there is nothing wrong with you. There are great resources, health information, community, ways to handle coming out, meeting people, politics around the world, sex, even marriage/children. There is humor, too! Any critiques I have are not meant to detract from this--just need to put that out front. Now, I know this is going to sound wild, but after listening to this book and wrestling with my thoughts and feelings, I think this book could've been more inclusive. It acknowledges the wide range of LGBT experiences, but spends more time on some than others. M/m and f/f relationships are covered, but I felt like a lot of the book skews to m/m. A case in point: in discussion of sex, the book repeatedly emphasizes ALWAYS USE A CONDOM throughout the whole text, but in a section talking about f/f sex, I think a dental dam was mentioned once in passing, but it never actually said what one was?? So...not the most inclusive there. Bisexuality is mentioned fairly frequently, but I'm not sure I felt it was completely covered on its own. And I'm thinking of one specific passage where, I'm paraphrasing, but it was something along the lines of, honestly it sounds harder to be a bisexual, let's all go hug a bisexual today. Which I felt in one fell swoop seemed to imply/assume that the person reading the book is not bisexual, and that the wider audience of the book is not bisexual either. So even though the sentiment seems supportive, I felt it actually came across rather unintentionally exclusionary? Pansexuality was mentioned in passing twice that I recall, and was not explained or defined either time. I think the closest to a definition for it came in a quote from one of the survey respondents that are peppered throughout the book. If I remember correctly asexuality is mentioned a couple times, but in no way do I think it is given the coverage and consideration it deserves, and I don't think there was mention of the spectrum of asexuality, either. I also feel like there were some lines that were kind of exclusionary there too, along the lines of ""everyone experiences attraction and sexy feelings!"" or something to that effect. I don't remember the aromantic spectrum being mentioned at all. There is quite a bit of information about/for trans identities (at least to me, a non-trans person, I thought there was good information there), and though genderqueer and genderfluidity came up a little, I think there needed to be more coverage of nonbinary identities. Maybe it's unfair of me to expect something exhaustive, but if this book is calling itself a queer instruction manual, then I think there are some topics that it missed, and some language that is unintentionally implicitly not as inclusive as it needs to be. I don't think this on its own can be considered an endpoint; it's a good start, but it's not comprehensive. I listened to the first edition of this book, and I see that there is now a second edition out; maybe some of these things are addressed in the newer edition. Side note, I did not love the audiobook narration for this one. Weird pauses and sentence breaks, odd cadence. Not sure what was going on there.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40153615-melhara,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"December 16, 2023",1 like,0,"This book was disappointing. This had the potential to be a great book. But rather than being a book targetted at the gay community (as the title suggests), the author proclaims right at the beginning of the book (and in the synopsis) that this book is for everyone including those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, queer, bisexual, transgender, and straight. But that isn't true at all. This book aims to be a user manual to being gay, with a focus on providing advice to gay cis white men and male young adults who know nothing about being gay or gay culture. The book offers information on stereotypes, some history, and vocabulary, as well as advice on coming out, dating, safe sex, sex tips, and introductory information to gay culture and icons.The author attempts to include the rest of the LGBTQ+ community and offers some advice that would apply to those who identify as lesbian or transgender but they seem to have been included as an afterthought as much of the book focuses on the author's experiences of being a cis white gay man. If I could re-edit this entire book and audiobook, I would start by making the following changes:1. Target one main audience (gay teens) since the strongest parts of the book were the sections that offered advice to gay teens. Other information related to the LGBTQ+ community can be included as an introduction, but the book should not be read as a guide intended for them as advice for gay men isn't necessarily applicable to lesbian, bisexual, queer, and trans individuals. And honestly, a gay man has no business offering sex advice to lesbians...2. Include a section on asexuality/aromantic/homoromantic/graysexual/allosexual/etc. Not all gay men are highly sexual beings, as this book seems to imply. 3. Cast a British narrator for the audiobook. I have no idea why an American narrator was chosen, especially since the author is British and the book references UK stats and British gay culture. It also sounded really weird hearing an American read certain sentences (and British words) that were very clearly written with a British intonation in mind. 4. Make sure that the narrator reads a bit faster. I listened to the audiobook at x2 speed (I listen to most books anywhere between x1.1 to x1.3 speed and have never had to speed up a book this much!)5. Have a different narrator read the quotes. It was really hard to tell when the narrator was reading a quote or when they were narrating the author's own experiences (there were a bunch of quotes sprinkled throughout the book submitted by people from all over the world sharing their own experiences with coming out, dating, sex, etc.)6. Tone done on the ""cool"" conversational tone. The conversational tone was great for the most part, but the use of words like cringe, LOL, and yo, were unnecessary and came across as being forced and unnatural. 7. To make the book more timeless, the gay icons (which consist mainly of outdated pop-culture references) should probably be replaced with notable gay men or LGBTQ+ people throughout history. Note: Since the publication of this book, the author has come out as a transwoman. I'm hoping she'll come out with a new book titled 'This Book is Trans' that will cover everything everything that was missing from this book.tl;dr - I may recommend this to young gay cis-boys who don't know anything (and I mean anything) about gay culture (which is unlikely, seeing as there are much better resources on social media now). In fact, the more I think about it, the more I would rather recommend them to the following books instead:

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6268407-audra-ouija-reads,This Book Is Gay,No Rating,"June 3, 2024",1 like,0,"Having been published a decade ago in 2014, this book is understandably dated in many ways. Gender studies is a field that is constantly moving forward, which is great in many ways, but that means it's hard to pin down in a book. Importantly, this book could use a really robust revision to be more inclusive. I did enjoy the easy-going, fun tone of the book and the quotes from various persons of the queer rainbow offering their perspectives throughout. It is a warm and uplifting book, with the main message being that whoever you are and however you identify, you are totally okay, deserve to give and receive love how you see fit, and should be able to claim a happy life freely as the person you are.Here's some of what I found to be less than good:The dated cultural references alone might alienate a younger reader, but the terminology and some blatant generalizations about identities are where the author should add more nuance. There is definitely a longer and more nuanced discussion about religion than this book allows for. The book also focuses mostly on the United Kingdom, as that is where the author resides.For a book about queerness that even discusses how the binary is a construct, there is a clear tendency toward binary thinking. Gay men seem to be the primary audience, with the secondary audience being gay women. That's not super inclusive. Transness and trans identities need to be revisited and given more care and attention; there is even a fair amount of what at best would be considered trans erasure. Nonbinary identities are also excluded beyond a brief mention of ""genderqueer."" ""He or she"" instead of gender-neutral ""they"" is used more than once, for example, which is pretty cringe-inducing.Though asexuality is introduced as a potential identity, aromanticism is not discussed and ace identities (the spectrum of which is not discussed) are promptly ignored by the rest of the book. Sex is a huge focus—I'd say the main focus—of the book. Of course sex education is important, and queer sex education in schools is basically nonexistent. But that's not all there is. Near the end, for example, the book offers this: ""All people—gay or otherwise—must recognize that there is one universal truth of the universe: We all want to have sex with loads of people."" Yeah, that's just not true. Language matters. Representation matters. Nuance matters. I am not rating this because, as you can see, it's pretty complicated. No book can be a monolith, and it's always going to be a product of its time and subject to the author's own biases. With an understanding that this book is flawed in many ways, I think this book could be a fine introduction to queerness for tweens/early teens—as long as it is only one small part of that education. At the very least, it offers space to begin conversations about what's good and bad in here, how things have changed in the last decade, what other queer educators say, and how the reader might feel and experience things differently. In the end, for me, it's about having and continuing these crucial conversations because that's what makes the world a more inclusive place for everyone.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30362142-k,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"April 12, 2024",1 like,0,"Not a very inclusive book but you think it would be since it was written by a gay man who transitioned into a woman. Reading it felt very male centric. When they had a cartoon drawing of a man it talked about how the testicles like to be treated with loving care and that a breeze can cause a stiffy in the penis but when they have drawings of the vagina it talks about the reproductive system, babies, and nerve endings. See how one described is fun and cute but the other one goes into a science textbook lecture. It’s a little too cheeky and childish for me when the subject matter goes into adult themes. Someone literally shared a story about hooking up with a married man when they were 16, I don’t wanna be the moral police but I also don’t think that that should just be casually shared in a book trying to teach (I assume predominately kids) to come out. It was in the section about losing your virginity and I don’t really think of that type of predation should be given a spotlight. Especially when the book praised Harvey Milk. There’s good and bad to the gay community don’t just hide our dirty laundry.The book under sold the level of danger that can arrive when coming out. There is no shame in hiding who you are until you are literally in a safe space to do so, be that be in college or when you have your own home. The book does nothing to stress politics, you know the laws that are keeping people from being true to themselves. You’d think a book about rights and activism would’ve at least had a chapter on that. No, we get an index of celebrities on the spectrum that felt like padding. I felt like the author was trying to help with this book but they kind of made it too much about themselves and their own opinions. Again, instead of talking about going outside and voting they instead have a section about why you shouldn’t buy music from certain people. I did like the information provided about trans people, but it feels hollow when the author identifies as one but then you can actively feel their distance from women. At times the author was just calling somebody else in to try and write the book for them. Suspiciously they sound just like the author when they insert their own opinions and make a funny little jokes. Eg, “why do dildos have veins it’s gross“. Or they’ll just supplement a section needed with someone’s story. Even the little cartoons would have stereotype designs, despite being cute at times. The book doesn’t get into how gatekeeping a lot of these terms can be and how at times it doesn’t even matter to have a label.I didn’t even get into the abysmal part about religions. The author just straight up says Judaism started homophobia. This author has made a career about their transition but I’m not really interested in any of their other books from what I’ve seen here. Her take on the spectrum seems very one-sided and she isn’t an expert simply for transitioning. I feel like if they gave a damn they would’ve given proceeds to one of the charities mentioned in the book. But thats just me. —That’s all I’ve got. I feel like there’s better books and that there’s worse books. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

But as a resource specifically for gay cis boys/men (and their parents), this one might be somewhere to start.Other reviewers have talked about how this book barely touches on identities other than gay/lesbian; this book probably would've benefitted from diverse co-writers, beyond just a survey of LGBT* youth. In short: Dawson uses ""gay"" and ""homophobia"" as umbrella terms and it often feels like bisexuality is an afterthought; there is also some transphobic language (equating biological sex with gender, often relative to others' sexuality), as well as asexual/aromantic erasure and exclusion of nonbinary folx. Pansexuality is only briefly mentioned as a historical precursor (i.e., in Greek/Roman society) to bisexuality, though in reality it's a distinct identity.There's a lot of emphasis on sex, based on an assumption that everyone wants sex, and in fact gay people really want sex — that's where the ace erasure comes in, despite the inclusion of the term in the glossary and opening definitions. (Asexuality is also a spectrum; it's not a binary between ""promiscuous"" and ""celibate."") The language also focuses on ""male"" and ""female"" relationships, excluding nonbinary/questioning folx as well as bi/pan people's relationships with them. There's also no mention of aromanticism, because the secondary assumption is that everyone also wants to be in a romantic relationship. (Not to erase queerplatonic relationships, which are valid and great but not mentioned in this book.)Which is to say, a committed monogamous relationship. One section talks about open relationships, but polyamory is by and large dismissed as somehow inferior to monogamy. (Committed polyamorous relationships exist, though you wouldn't learn that from this book.)The major selling point is that this is unapologetically gay, with reminders throughout that it isn't wrong or shameful not to be heterosexual — though some of it is expressed as a ""gays vs. straights"" dichotomy, despite an ending message that it's not a war. The author tries to be witty and sometimes succeeds, though some of the pop culture references are already quite dated, and some passages are cringeworthy in their crudeness (cutesy names for genitalia? No thanks). It's generally optimistic about things getting better for LGBT* folx on both personal and societal/global levels, at least in relatively progressive [Western] countries, which is a message many young people might need to hear.-----------

I intent for the word to come across as an inclusive umbrella term, and as a queer person myself I mean no ill intent in using this term.**I originally loved this book when I first encountered it. I will forever remember this as being the first book focusing on queer content that I was able to grasp as the shy, confused baby gay that I was. I was new to the community, had just come to terms with my sexuality, and was intent on diving headfirst into the culture of a community I was looking at with fresh eyes. I believe that this is why I originally had grown to hold such a love for this book. It was a platform that I was able to jump off of in my journey to better understand my own community, however, I realize now that there are faults to this book that went unnoticed before.The book seems to stick well to lessons involving the gay men of the community. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, I do believe that it is misleading for a book that markets itself as being an all-inclusive guide to the LGBTQ+ community. While not being a gay man myself, I did find the book helpful because it gave me information on culture that at the time I was uneducated about. However, I understand the sentiment that queer women, transgender people, and those in the non-binary umbrella feel left out in this book.Another issue that I have grown to take with this book, is the attitude that the author takes when talking about certain topics. While I do not believe in cherry picking sentiments, I do recognize that there are several instances where things definitely could have been worded differently. Exclaiming ""lesbians love vaginas"" seems a bit out of touch, especially when coming from the words of a gay, cis male. Despite these faults, and there are others that I have not named, this book can be a good gateway for young, uneducated people into the community. I believe that as long as people keep in mind how the book has grown to become outdated, it can be a decent avenue of education for those looking for it. Show more"

I wanted to love it because it's a banned book and because it's gay, but this just fell short for me (though not because it's banned or gay). On the back, it says this book is for EVERYONE and honestly? It's mostly just for cis gay men. While I understand this book has a section on sex education, the focus all throughout the book is about, ""Who do you CONSTANTLY think about having SEX with: boys or girls?"" when sexual identity is SO much more than sex or ""the two genders"". What about just crushes and relationships? What about the growing number of teens identifying somewhere on the asexual spectrum? And cringiest of all, the book is chock full of attempts at casual conversation: the author repeated says ""sexyfuntimes"" instead of just ""sex"". I'm sorry, but if someone is old enough to be reading this book and learning about how to have anal sex, I think that they can handle reading the word ""sex"" without the author talking down to them. Other dated slang includes use of ""cray"" and ""preggers"" and I just know a gen z reader would roll their eyes at it. This book also purports to be for teens who are curious and questioning, but offers no guidance on exploring your sexuality or gender identity. It's SOLIDLY LGBT, not LGBTQIA+. If you're looking for gender neutral or inclusive language, it's not here. Nonbinary? Don't even bother with this. Even reading the revised edition, the sections for trans readers feel very separate and minimal. Overall, and this is crazy to say given the recent publication, this book feels dated! And with a reference to Grindr on every other page, it might as well say ""CIS MEN ONLY"". The advice is just too biased and shoddy and there are better books out there now. Honestly, I don't think I would hand this to anyone but a confidently out cis gay boy. There just isn't enough in it for anyone else. Bummer!Edited to add: I completely forgot the horrible chapter on religions vs. sexuality!!! It's so bad and unnecessary and incorrect! There are SO many good books now on the intersection of Christianity (or other faiths) and sexuality and Dawson should have stepped aside and referred to those instead of pulling the classic ""Well you wear mixed textiles!"" argument from the old testament of the bible.Show more"

It makes a good attempt at inclusivity, even (briefly) mentioning asexuality at one point, but while I understand it would be impossible to include everything without the book being thousands of pages long it still felt disappointingly lacking in places.There's a very strong focus on sex through the majority of the book which made me as an asexual feel slightly alienated. For the most part it felt like what the book was saying was that who you're attracted to is almost entirely down to who you want to have sex with, which isn't the case. While there were a few small mentions of asexuality, that was as far as it went. Dawson also focuses a lot on the gender binary despite pointing out at one point that there are more than two genders. He also uses ""LGBT*"" throughout the book as an indicator that there is a whole range of sexualities beyond that basic acronym but he mentions very few of them. Even just a short list of various other sexualities would have been nice instead of just limiting everything to 'gay, lesbian, bi, curious, and queer.'Overall, I enjoyed the book. I liked the use of real people's stories. Everyone's experience is different and it's impossible to write a book on the experience of being LGBT+ while only using your own personal experiences, so I really liked that Dawson does a wide survey of other LGBT+ people to get their opinions and stories.Despite the heavy focus on sex, the book also goes into detail about the numerous issues facing LGBT+ people, such as homophobia, marriage and adoption rights, what the laws regarding LGBT+ rights are in countries all over the world, etc. It even has a short section about being the parent of an LGBT+ child and how to encourage and support your child, and there's a list of UK based hotline numbers and support groups at the back of the book.Although lacking in certain areas, This Book Is Gay does a pretty good job of giving an overview on the experiences of being LGBT+ and I would recommend it to any young person just coming out or questioning their sexuality/gender identity, parents of LGBT+ kids, or people who would just like to be a little more informed, regardless of their sexuality/gender identity.

Obviously, bigots are offended by the rainbow on the cover and the title of the book. After reading several reviews of the book (after feeling like something was off), I have more insight into what this book was missing. I noticed the author frequently said LGB and cut off there. I'm not sure the research that went into this book because I listened to the audiobook, so I have no clue on references and what not. But it really feels like a gay man *who has since come out as trans* wrote this book and decided since he was gay, that made him an authority on all things gay. This book does cover important topics. I especially liked that there was a chapter on how teachers could discuss gay sex in sex education classes. But there is so much missing from this book. This book acts as if there are straight people, gay men, lesbians, oh and bisexual people exist sometimes and other than occasionally mentioning transgender people, there were lots of groups of people not mentioned. I feel like this kind of book should really be a collaboration piece. Whereas from what I can tell, the author only brought in a woman to discuss how women have sex with each other (I think?).I think this book is a great lesson that it's okay to not be an expert on everything, research your topic more, especially when you are discussing something so important to so many. Also, I think about the people who would benefit most from this book, gay/questioning teens, and how this book is anything but subtle.

I blame myself more than the book though. It IS a good book, I was just a crappy pupil, lol. Okay, enough blame. This Book is Gay is a nice little guidebook to anyone who's ever had a stray thought, and even then it has this whole section at the end for being who are straight but care for LGBT* people, and all of that's nice. It's broken down into sections that I think really help because a lot of information is coming at you at once and it helps slow that all down so you have time to think and catch up. Personally if nothing else this book explained what so many different LGBT* terms were, I was sorely lacking in this area. I joked that I live under a social media/worldly rock, but I'm 100% being honest when I say it. The fact that everyone thinks I'm kidding is probably worse than the fact that I'm not, lol. But because of that particularly personality trait, this book was more than helpful in broadening my knowledge at least for this one area. Also I liked Dawson's tone, and Levithan's introduction was priceless (and a large portion of why I was like, Yeah-this is gonna be interesting). I haven't read a lot of LGBT* books so I'm not really sure where this one falls in hierarchy so to someone who is quite oblivious I give it 3 stars, to someone who knows more perhaps it is owed one more or one less.

For as much as the author makes little jabs at the patriarchy, she never breaks out of traditional gender norms throughout the book and outright forgot (or refused) to include any reference to people who’s experience with gender isn’t within a traditional binary. As a non-binary person myself, this seemed like a very big oversight.Most of the terminology and contents within this book also came across as incredibly outdated and often times inaccurate to current Queer issues and culture. For example, the terms “transsexual” and “transvestite” are used quite frequently throughout the book, often interchangeably with “transgender” despite the attempts at separating the definitions of these terms early on in the introductory chapters. I could be wrong, but given my lengthy time existing in Queer communities, I have never once heard the terms “transsexual” or “transvestite” used to describe someone EXCEPT through self-identification. Everything I’ve heard, seen, and read from the transgender community has informed me that these are terms that, while some older folks may still identify themselves with, are ultimately not regarded as a respectful way to define a transgender individual, unless they otherwise say so. This sort of nuance, which is incredibly important in a book regarding LGBTQ+ issues and life, is completely absent This Book is Gay. It’s such a confusing message, too, since a large portion of the book is going over LGBT stereotypes and expressing that while these are stereotypes, they’re not always true. However, it more often came across like the book was much more ready to lean into the sentiment of “stereotypes exist for a reason” than “stereotypes are harmful”. Ultimately, This Book is Gay was a disappointing promise of inclusion and understanding that, when actually read, reveals a childish, one-sided view on a community while pretending it has something for everyone. Personally, I’d stay away from this one if you’re looking for an educational resource on LGBTQ+ living.Show more"

It's definitely written in a style that is engaging to teens and since it's an overall introduction, it's understandably pretty general. It is very affirming and sex positive. Published in 2015, it's maybe not the most up to date, but it's not dated too badly. If you don't already have it in your library, I probably would look for something published more recently (if there is something?), but if you do have it, I don't think it needs to be weeded. If there was anything factually inaccurate, I didn't pick up on it (not that I am an expert!). The author is British and the book uses some British slang, etc. but nothing that I think American teens would have any trouble with. The book includes lots of testimonials, advice, slices of life, etc. from queer people of all stripes and from many different places, which is really valuable since it is such a diverse community and there are so many ways to be LGBTQ+. It's a very affirming book and a good starting point for teens curious to know more about LGBTQ+ or parents of teens who might want to know more or get ideas about how to talk to their teens about sexuality.

This book teaches more about sex and sexuality than did all my years in public school combined. This book demystifies sex in a way that I imagine would be helpful to every teen regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. For young people, it would likely take away some of the fear that leads to making dangerous choices. And for that it gets 4 stars.Now, the critique. Taking into account that this is a book is written for teens, certain parts were awfully reductive. In particular, in the very beginning when the author provides a quick overview of sexuality, he really gets transgender wrong. That is corrected later in the book but it rubbed me the wrong way. Secondly, there is an overwhelming bias toward long-term, monogamous relationships. The author also confuses non-monogamy with promiscuity. And lastly the list of gay icons was overwhelmingly white. The author mentions intersectionality one time and, otherwise, the book is written from the perspective of a gay white cis man. As a non-gay white cis non-man, I have no standing to say who is and who is not a gay icon. But I was patiently waiting for a mention of Bayard Rustin or James Baldwin and I was disappointed.Having said all of that, I wouldn't think twice about recommending this book to a young person. It discusses sex in such an approachable way the benefits would outweigh the harms in my opinion.Show more"

One of the aspects of the book that makes it particularly appealing is how the author includes the voices of individuals to a survey he conducted.

I can see how this book would be very helpful for gay cis men. The author is a gay man, so that makes sense. However, there really isn't a lot of content for the LB population, which he says he'll include. He also says he'll include trans people, which he kind of does sometimes. But I also know that many from the trans community didn't like this one and its portrayal of them, which is also sparse. For a book that says it's a guidebook to the whole community, it falls well short of that aim. Some language is also outdated. This was published in 2014, and we've improved since then.That said, I think that this book, which is one of the most banned books of 2022, is a fun, factual, and important book addressing a lot of topics that are missing from other sources. The main message is: whoever you are that's fine, which is an important and great one. It also has some good info on STIs, and coming out. Content: Refrences to sex and sexual content.

I liked that it included a list of 'gay icons' and even some advice for parents.The reason why I only gave 4 stars and not 5 is that, in my opinion, you can't find that much information about being bi and basically nothing about being pan/poly etc. If you write a book that seems to be addressed at people who are questioning then you should either give them ""all the options"", maybe add links or other sources where people can read more about the sexualities you don't talk about, or make a disclaimer that 90% of the book addresses being gay/lesbian.I don't want to comment on the chapters about being trans since I am cis and therefore I don't think I'm in the position to assess whether those chapters are helpful...Show more"

Thats okay, this book was written from the prospective of someone who identified, at the time, as a gay man. That is where her experience came from. As other people have pointed out in their reviews, Juno associates gender with genitalia (men have penises, women have vaginas) and there is no real representation in this book for persons on the ace spectrum. Its assumed that everyone wants to have sex. Some of the jokes and humor in this book are also problematic, verging on ablism and fat phobia. Most of the problematic content is a product of its time.I dont think this book deserves to be thrown in the trash though. This is a good starting point for gay teens (specifically male) who have no social support or no sexual support.

In a perfect world, all parents would be having these convos with their young ADULTS. But there are a lot of hateful idiots in this world. I personally learned a lot about the LGBT community and individuals from this book. And if/when my kids start asking questions about their friends or themselves or others in our community, I will point to this book as a resource we can read and discuss together. Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51979018-hannah-von-queerbuch,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"January 11, 2018",1 like,0,"queerbuch.wordpress.comKurzbeschreibung InhaltEs handelt sich um einen Ratgeber oder ein sogenanntes „Coming-Out-Buch“. Nach und nach werden in den Kapiteln die Fragestellungen behandelt, die man sich in der Phase des inneren und äußeren Coming Outs so stellen könnte. Angefangen bei der »Gay-Community«, Begriffserklärungen zu den Themen LGBT* (was bedeutet das alles überhaupt?), dazu auch das Thema Labels und inwieweit man sich selbst kategorisieren muss/kann, biologische Hintergründe der Homo- und Transsexualität, Stereotype und Klischees, Angst und Homophobie, Hilfestellungen zum Coming-Out selbst, wo und wie man Gleichgesinnte treffen kann, wie schwuler und lesbischer Sex funktioniert, Partnerschaften, Regenbogenfamilien, eine Liste von Schwulen- und Lesbenikonen, ein Kapitel nur für die Eltern, deren Kinder sich möglicherweise als LGBT* identifizieren und eine Reihe an nützlichen Organisationen und Websites.Meine MeinungDas klingt jetzt natürlich erstmal nach klassischem Coming-Out-Ratgeber für LGBT*s in der Selbstfindung. FALSCH. Also schon auch richtig, aber es war für mich ein unglaublicher Genuss, dieses Buch zu lesen. James Dawson hat ja sonst auch schon einige Jugendromane veröffentlicht und damit bewiesen, dass er Schreibtalent besitzt, was Geschichten erzählen angeht. Das Buch ist durchweg (bis auf die ganz ernsten Stellen) unglaublich humorvoll geschrieben. Zusätzlich zieren alle paar Seiten comicartige Strichzeichnungen das Papier, die teilweise zum schießen sind, teilweise aber auch inhaltlichen Mehrwert zum Geschriebenen bieten. Es ist natürlich als Ratgeber zu verstehen, wenn man noch nicht so genau weiß, wie das nun alles ist mit dem LGBT*-sein. Wenn man dabei ist, seine (Homo-/Trans-)Sexualität zu entdecken, steht man ja für gewöhnlich erstmal vor einem Riesenberg von »was erwartet mich da blo�� alles?«. Hier kann das Buch aus meiner Sicht wirklich unterstützen, weil es Mut macht und Unterstützung gibt, sich selbst als richtig und positiv zu sehen. Ich weiß nicht, wie es euch geht, aber ich fand Ratgeber und Aufklärungsbücher als Kind/Jugendliche (und auch heute noch!) irgendwie doof. Es wird so ein riesen Wind um Veränderung und das Erwachsenwerden gemacht, und irgendwie habe ich auch noch kein Buch dazu in der Hand gehabt, in dem ich mir nicht irgendwie komisch vorkam, denn: 1. sind die Cover der Aufklärungsbücher meistens ziemlich schlecht gestaltet oder ziemlich eindeutig und 2. kam ich mir vom Erzählstil meistens ein bisschen verarscht vor. Genauer: Wie wenn ein Erwachsener auf »coolen Onkel / coole Tante« macht und vorgibt, ganz genau zu wissen, wie man sich fühlt, aber selbst rein sprachlich meistens mit dem gewollt Jugendlichen ziemlich daneben liegt. Hier ist das etwas anders. Das Cover lässt zwar unmissverständlich auf homosexuellen Inhalt schließen, sieht aber ansonsten ziemlich cool aus. Bunt und selbstbewusst und richtig. Es ist zwar im engsten Sinne ein Ratgeber, aber es ist gleichzeitig unglaublich unterhaltsam und lässt sich fast wie ein Roman lesen. Deshalb empfehle ich das Buch nicht nur an noch unsichere / nicht festgelegte Jugendliche im Coming-Out-Prozess, sondern an jeden, den das Thema interessiert und der sich näher damit befassen will oder einfach nur lustige Klischees über LGBT*s lesen will, an denen zwar manchmal etwas dran ist, die meistens aber einfach nur urkomisch sind. Zusätzlich lässt der Autor zu den meisten Kapiteln echte Geschichten bzw. Statements von LGBT*s einfließen, die das Ganze auflockern und ganz verschiedene Erfahrungen aus dem echten Leben zeigen.Eins der wenigen Dinge, und nun kommen wir zum kritischen Teil, das mich manchmal gestört hat, war ab und zu das Wording von James Dawson. Ja, die Erscheinung des britischen Originals* ist schon drei Jahre her, und auch in diesen drei Jahren kann einiges passieren. Vielleicht erinnere ich mich falsch, aber war nicht der Begriff »Homo-Ehe« auch schon 2014 irgendwie verpönt? Dieses altbekannte »Es heißt einfach nur Ehe, wir gehen ja auch nicht Homo-Einkaufen oder machen keinen Homo-Sport«. Der Autor spricht hier konsequent von der »Homo-Ehe«. Was ich auch nicht ganz so passend finde ist, dass sich ein sehr großer Teil der Sätze mit dem Thema Sex befassen. Erst ziemlich spät erwähnt er noch, dass es ja nicht nur um Sex geht, sondern auch um Liebe, denn nur Sex allein macht nicht glücklich. Vielleicht ist das aber auch darin zu begründen, dass der Autor aus eigener Sicht eben nur die männliche schwule Seite beschreiben konnte, für den Rest musste auch er recherchieren. Und Achtung – Klischee: Wie der Autor im Buch selbst sagt, haben schwule Männer tendenziell deutlich mehr Sexualpartner als der Rest. Er befasst sich auch viel mit der lesbischen Frauenseite, aber ein größerer Teil ist hier den Schwulen gewidmet. Aus meiner Sicht hätte er noch mehr auf den Teil Partnerschaft und Familie eingehen können, aber da sich How to Be Gay doch verstärkt an die junge Generation richtet, wäre das Buch wohl sonst zu dick geworden.FazitEin unglaublich unterhaltsames Buch über »Coming Out, Sex, Gender und Liebe«, das sich unter der Kategorie als Ratgeber tarnt, aus meiner Sicht aber fast wie ein Roman zu lesen ist. Etwas für sich finden kann darin jeder, egal ob man sich gerade findet, sein Kind sich gerade findet, man einfach nur interessiert ist oder schon ganz lange im Team LGBT* spielt.Weil es sich um einen Ratgeber handelt,gibt es an dieser Stelle keine Punkteverteilung.Meine Wertung: 4/5 SterneShow more"

In realtà le problematiche sono moltissime: taglia quasi totalmente fuori l'asessualità e il non binarismo dalle sue pagine, in particolare la prima delle due cose, dipingendo ogni tipo di relazione gay come solo voglia di trovare un partner sessuale, come se la parte romantica fosse una cosa marginale (cosa che non è in toto così neanche nelle relazioni allosessuali). Inoltre mi sembra ci sia un radicato problema di scollamento tra il tono usato nel romanzo in quanto indirizzato ad un pubblico molto giovane e gli argomenti trattati.

I am strongly opposed to banning books and believe that professional librarians in our schools (high school for this book) select books for their collections that reflect the diverse students in the community. This is one of four books that have been challenged for their LGBTQ content (2 are currently being reviewed by the school board, 2 have already been affirmed by the board). This Book is Gay is a direct, simply explanation of what it means to be gay or any LGBTQ+ identity. It covers the basics of definitions, biology vs identify, stereotypes, coming out, why people fear anyone not straight or cisgender, and yes, sex. It is the description of gay sex that probably gets the most attention from the book banners. While any description of sex (gay or straight) makes me blush, Dawson's description is straight-forward and honest. She includes simple pencil drawers of a cisgender man and woman with all the relative parts labelled (no different from books used to educate teens about sex that I have seen). She does all this with a sense of humor and quotes from individuals that interviewed as part of her research. I would much rather have my teenager read this book than use the internet where who knows what will appear in their search results. Show more"

The book would have gotten five stars if it hadn’t been so binary when referring to gender. Trans issues were always referred to as MTF or FTM, never addressing the fact that someone could have no gender, be all genders, third gender, two spirit, genderqueer, their own personal gender, or any other non-binary/agender identity. Dawson maybe wrote the word non-binary twice throughout this whole book. Dawson also sparingly referred to asexuality and literally never referred to aromanticism (actually, she implies multiple times that those who live alone/don’t couple off will eventually feel lonely and she explicitly says that everyone is looking for romantic love, and these simply are not factual statements). So, overall, those of us who fit into any of the categories she left out are still wondering when representation of us is ever going to make it into the mainstream LGBT+ vocabulary/community, let alone the straight vocab/community.It’s still good to see that this book exists. I’m not mad at it and how well Dawson writes about her chosen topics. I just wish it had been more comprehensive.

This book doesn’t tell you everything about being gay or lesbian or trans or whatever (asexuality is not covered really, unfortunately), but it is a digestible guide, and what it’s like to be part of the LGBT family. There were a few things for I was like “really?” both positively and negatively. For instance, the author only notes that transvestite is a term for a cross dressing man without saying that this term is derogatory for many people. However he does talk about the struggles of being trans in a compassionate way. It’s important to note that this is told from a gay man’s perspective, and as much as he is aware of his own cis-genderness and privilege, his perspective is a bit limited at times.

I thought the author was hilarious, sensitive, and honest. This is a perfect handbook for a young LGBT person who is looking for some guidance and information.

The primary audience for this book is teens or so as it goes over what exactly LGBTQ+ is and means, including some of the history, misconceptions, and how the different members can have sex. Although it did get into the sexy-time aspect, it was at a sex-ed level and description... touching on the enjoyment aspect and description of some acts, which to be honest is a good addition. Otherwise, like me, you just have to learn about it from peers and porn. Soo. Yeah. The book also had amusing illustrations that went with many of the talking points and some diagrams when it got to parts of the body (nothing that isn't presented now).

On the very first page, ""Lesson One"" is meant to list the premise of the book, the ""this is just the way things are"" assumptions, if you will:•Sometimes men like men.•Sometimes women like women.•Sometimes women like men and women.•Sometimes men like women and men.So far, so good. It seems a good approach to just spell out the letters of the quiltbag one by one in super-simple terms. •Sometimes people don't like anyone.Awesome! Asexual folks are included right off the bat, when so often they are left off of the proverbial laundry list. But wait… that phrasing is awfully weird. Yes, it's supposed to fit with the light and casual phrasing used for Gs, Ls, and Bs, but the unintended consequence is that it makes the As look like reclusive, antisocial, people-hating hermits. While it's true I don't know anyone well who identifies as asexual, I doubt it's because they're all hiding out at home, hating the entirety of the human species. People in general – even the kids who comprise this book's intended audience – are going to understand that ""Sometimes men like men"" is code for ""Some men like to have sex with other men"". But in a book that purports to answer very basic and introductory questions, ""Sometimes people don't like anyone"" seems a truly terrible and needlessly ""othering"" way to paraphrase ""Some people prefer not to have sex at all"" or ""Some people do not generally experience sexual desire"".Next up, and remember, we're still on page one here:•Sometimes a man might want to be a woman.•Sometimes a woman might want to be a man.I may not know any asexual people, but I do know transgender people, and even if I didn't, I would know enough to know that they do not think of themselves as ""really"" the gender of their birth sex but would just like to switch it up and ""convert"" to the other one. In reality, the statement we hear from trans* folks over and over is, ""I never felt like a {insert birth sex here}. I always knew that I was actually a {not my birth sex}; I just want to live my life as a {not my birth sex, but my real gender}, and have my appearance better fit how I feel on the inside."" What transgender person would express their gender identity and expression struggle as, ""Yeah, I'm a guy, but I want to be a woman""?!The kicker here is that the author, James Dawson, now presents as Juno Dawson, a woman. Yes, a transgender person actually wrote that.And maybe all this crappy wording would be mitigated if the author's next paragraph said something like, ""Of course, I'm totally oversimplifying things here, so let's break it down."" But the very next words (after a thankfully-inoffensive [but incomplete] genderqueer list item) are, and again I quote:Ok, got it? It really is that simple.I could end the lesson there, but I don't think a few pages would make a very good book, so I suppose I should go into a bit more depth…upon which the seemingly put-upon author then embarks on a very general book introduction, about how it is the instruction manual everyone wishes they had been given upon coming out, and welcome to a fabulous club, etc. Hopefully, some better definitions and descriptions are presented later in the book, but it certainly doesn't happen in the preview. It's like that old adage says, you only get one chance to make a first impression.Further down on yes-this-is-still-page-two, Dawson clarifies just who all this ""instruction manual"" is for:But this is a manual for everyone—no matter your gender or sexual preference.Sexual preference??? Sexual PREFERENCE?? You mean that antiquated term that even the more enlightened members of the clergy and the GOP had started replacing years ago with the far more accurate and inoffensive (staggeringly so, by comparison) term sexual orientation? I mean seriously: sexual preference? On page freakin' two of a book you want scared, closeted kids to read? If I sound apoplectic, I am. As the kids today say, I can't even. I don't know how the rest of the book is, but reading the reviews here, it appears to have committed some other sins and faux pas, but to be honest, it would have to be pretty spectacular and mow my lawn every weekend for a damn year to boot in order to redeem itself in my estimation for the sin tally it racked up by the end of page two. And the preview is of a later edition, so there has clearly been an opportunity to correct these errors of… what? judgement? These certainly go way beyond typos. Well, this is certainly the longest I've ever ranted about a preview. I really do hope that Juno reads it and considers the implications of her careless words right at the beginning, and anywhere else she might have been sloppy or glib throughout the book. There is certainly a need for books like the one This Book is Gay aspires to be.Show more"

Und was passiert dann? Wie findet man andere schwule Jungs? Und warum fühlen sich manche Menschen im falschen Körper gefangen? Mit über hundert Originalbeiträgen von lesbischen, schwulen, bi- und transsexuellen Jugendlichen, die ein unendliches Spektrum sexueller Identitäten repräsentieren. Für alle, die immer schon mehr wissen wollten über Homosexualität und Transgender – und für alle, die einfach nur neugierig sind! (Quelle: Verlag)Meine Meinung: LGTB spielt eine immer größere Rolle. Nicht nur in den aktuellen Nachrichten sondern auch in vielen Büchern. Beim Lesen ist mir in letzter Zeit etwas ganz wichtiges und tolles aufgefallen: In der Vergangenheit wurden meiner Meinung nach schwule Pärchen, lesbische Pärchen oder auch Transgender in den Romanen, die ich lese nicht beachtet. Das hat mich immer sehr gestört. Denn wie kann es sein, dass von den unglaublich vielen Charakteren, die in einem Buch vorkommen 20 Bücher lang keiner Nicht-Heterosexuell ist. Das war für mich unverständlich denn auf meinem Bekanntenkreis kann ich euch locker mehr als 5 Leute nennen, die man der LGTB Kultur zuordnet. Dieser Trend hat sich stark gewandelt. In jedem sagen wir mal dritten Buch finde ich aktuell eine Protagonistin mit zwei Moms oder einen Charakter, der erkennt, dass er auf Jungs und Mädchen steht. In nächster Zeit erscheinen außerdem viele Jugendbücher, die diese Thematik als Hauptthema haben. So zum Beispiel Two Boys Kissing und Zusammen werden wir leuchten, die im Fischer Verlag erscheinen und über die ich euch definitiv auch berichten werde. Leider gibt es trotz diesem erfreulichen Trend noch viele homophobe Äußerungen in den Medien und vielleicht auch in eurem Umfeld. Nicht jeder erkennt, dass LGTB nicht unnormal bedeutet und wurde vielleicht sogar so erzogen. Deshalb ist es wichtig Aufklärung zu bieten. Und da kommt James Dawson mit seinem Buch How to be Gay genau richtig. Dieses Buch ist ein Sachbuch und ich habe, bevor ich zum es zum ersten Mal aufgeschlagen habe, gedacht, dass ich einzelne Kapitel daraus lesen werde. So, wie man es bei Sachbüchern eben macht. Tatsächlich habe ich jedoch jede einzelne Seite von vorne bis hinten gelesen, denn James Dawson konnte mich mit seinem persönlichen, humorvollen und angenehmen Schreibstil komplett begeistern. How to be Gay ist nämlich nicht nur aufklärend. Nein, es ist auch noch so wundervoll geschrieben, dass man, egal ob LGTB oder nicht, gerne aufgeklärt wird. Was mich ehrlich gesagt aber ein bisschen traurig gemacht hat ist, dass das Buch sich sehr stark an die LGTB Szene wendet. Besonders an die, die noch kein Coming Out hatten. Natürlich ist dieses Buch primär ein Handbuch für Lesben, Schwule, Transgender und Bisexuelle. Aber obwohl direkt zu Beginn gesagt wird, dass ALLE Menschen, egal ob heterosexuell oder nicht normal und gleichberechtigt sind, kommt es im Buch leider an vielen Stellen ganz anders rüber. Es wird von UNS der LGTB Szene gesprochen und von DEN ANDEREN. Heterosexuellen mit teilweise sehr feindlichen und unverständlichen Ansichten. Das hat mich als Nicht-Szene Mensch irgendwie auf eine indirekte Art nicht angesprochen und auch ein wenig ausgeschlossen. Das ist sehr schade denn ich finde, dass dieses Handbuch für Leute, die hetero sind viel, viel wichtiger ist. Ich würde How to be Gay viel lieber für alle sehen und nicht nur als ein Handbuch für LGTB. Gerade in so einem Buch sollte keiner ausgeschlossen werden. Besonders nicht die, die der Szene feindlich entgegentreten könnten. Bewertung: Trotz meiner kleinen Kritik erachte ich dieses Buch als sehr wichtig. Gerade deshalb gab es glaube ich auch diese Kritik meinerseits. Und auch wenn ihr euch als heterosexuell definiert solltet ihr dieses Buch unbedingt mal zur Hand nehmen. Gerade die ersten Kapitel sind für jeden von uns da und meines Erachtens sehr wichtig. Später im Buch wird es zwar sehr spezifisch für Angehörige der Szene aber auch die Erfahrungsberichte in diesem Teil könnten euch interessieren und eure Sicht ein bisschen weiter öffnen. James Dawson hat auf eine unterhaltsame Art und Weise ein sehr wichtiges Werk geschaffen, das den Zeitgeist komplett trifft und auf ein wichtiges Problem in unserer Gesellschaft hinweist: Homophobie. Deshalb kann und will ich meine teils negative Kritik aus dem Hauptteil gar nicht mit in die Wertung einnehmen und gebe How to be Gay 5 von 5 Füchschen und eine Leseempfehlung. Vielen Dank an den Fischer Verlag für die Zusendung dieses tollen *Rezensionsexemplars.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4540940-rike-random,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 4, 2020",1 like,0,"Diese und weitere Rezensionen findet ihr auf meinem Blog Anima Libri - BuchseeleJuno Dawsons „How to be Gay: Alles über Coming-out, Sex, Gender und Liebe“ ist ein Buch, das mir auf den ersten Blick wirklich ausgesprochen gut gefallen hat. Es ist überaus ansprechend aufgemacht, übersichtlich gegliedert und durch viele humorvolle Illustrationen aufgelockert. Der Autor deckt eine große Themenvielfalt ab und bietet damit einen guten Anhaltspunkt für alle, die einfach unsicher sind und erste Informationen suchen.Auf den zweiten Blick offenbaren sich dann aber doch auch einige Makel. Nicht in dem Sinne, dass Juno Dawson etwa falsche oder verzerrte Informationen bieten würde, das bestimmt nicht, denn inhaltlich ist „How to be Gay“ durchaus fundiert und, soweit ich das bewerten kann, auch korrekt, allerdings ist es doch sehr selektiv. Natürlich kann kein Buch jemals alle Bereiche eines Themengebiets gleichmäßig abdecken, aber da Juno Dawson für sich an der einen oder anderen Stelle dann doch selbst den Anspruch erhebt inklusiv zu sein, muss man einfach anmerken, dass der Fokus eben doch hauptsächlich auf Homosexualität, in vielen Fällen auch mit einer stärkeren Orientierung auf Schwule, ausgerichtet ist.In Themenblöcken zu Vorurteilen, Coming Out, Sex und und und verpackt die Autorin viele wichtige Fakten auf eine anschauliche und ansprechende Weise und vermittelt so definitiv ein gutes Grundwissen, das eindeutig über das hinausgeht, was einem z.B. im Schulunterricht normalerweise begegnet. Es werden viele Begriffe geklärt, sowohl im Bereich Sexualität als auch Geschlechtsidentität, aber für die meisten „Gruppen“ gehen die Informationen eben nicht über grundlegendes Allgemeinwissen hinaus. Das bedeutet, um die tatsächlich angesprochenen Zielgruppen und die dann doch eher außen vorgelassenen Randgruppen mal in Schubladen zu stopfen:- für Cisgender Schwule (Cis wäre dann das Gegenteil von Transgender, also Menschen, die sich mit dem biologischen Geschlecht identifizieren, mit dem sie geboren wurden) ist dieses Buch mit Sicherheit ein Quell an Informationen und eine sehr spannende Lektüre, während der man immer wieder direkt angesprochen wird- für Cisgender Lesben ist „How to be Gay“ okay. Es ist nicht uninteressant, es wird immer wieder mal auch ausdrücklich auf Lesben eingegangen, aber hätte ich dieses Buch vor, sagen wir mal, zehn Jahren auf der Suche nach Antworten in die Hände bekommen (und das ist ja das Publikum, an das sich James Dawson richtet), ich wäre wohl eher enttäuscht gewesen, denn wie so oft liegt der Fokus eben doch auf den Herren der Schöpfung – was der Autor an einigen Stellen, z.B. bei Statistiken, zwar kritisiert, selbst aber nicht anders handhabt.- für Bisexuelle… nun ja. Bisexualität wird definiert, aber ich kenne mehr als eine Person, die sich an der hier enthaltenen Definition stören würde und das wohl auch nicht ganz zu unrecht- für Asexuelle und alles, was da draußen sonst noch an Labels für Sexualität herumschwirrt, gilt in etwa das Selbe: Es gibt (vielleicht) eine Definition und das war’s dann leider auch schon…- und was Transgender angeht… Auch hier gibt es eine Definition, es gibt auch eine Darstellung der Unterschiede zwischen Transgender, Transvestiten, etc. pp., aber leider wird gerade auch an dieser Stelle eins tragisch deutlich: Die Autorin bleibt, trotz aller guten Vorsätze, die hier und da durchschimmern, in einem unschönen Schwarz-Weiß-Bild hängenSo gibt es in „How to be Gay“ immer wieder Stellen, an denen Juno Dawson auf die absolut fließenden Übergänge zwischen den verschiedenen „offiziellen“ Formen von Sexualität oder Geschlechtsidentität hinwei��t und den eigentlichen Irrsinn starrer Geschlechternormen, leider bedient sie sich sonst aber durchgängig einer sehr eingrenzenden Bezeichnung, unterscheidet klar zwischen „homo und hetero“ sowie „Mann und Frau“, was nun einmal nicht hinhaut, auf non-binäre Geschlechtsidentäten aber wird zum Beispiel gar nicht hingewiesen (es gibt einen kurzen Abschnitt zu „queer“, halt für alles, was sonst nirgends reinpasst), Bi-, Pan- oder Asexualtiät werden zwar erwähnt, aber auch da folgt nicht wirklich mehr Information und das finde ich doch wirklich schade, besonders da Juno Dawson gleichzeitig immer demonstrativ den Begriff LGBT* verwendet.Alles in allem ist „How to be Gay: Alles über Coming-Out, Sex, Gender und Liebe“ von Juno Dawson definitiv kein schlechtes Buch, aber es ist auch bei weitem nicht das, was es zu sein verspricht. Insgesamt leider deutlich einseitiger als ich mir erhofft hatte und abgesehen von grundlegendem Allgemeinwissen wohl nur für cis schwule Teens wirklich interessant. Schade! Aber da hatte ich mir definitiv mehr erhofft.Show more"

Another review that addresses this can be found here.Even though the author came out as transgender in 2015, gender feels like an afterthought and I did not feel represented. Simiarly, the revisions to include asexuals and other less known identities felt forced:The original text:
However, all people - gay or otherwise - must recognize that there is one universal truth of the universe:WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE.
Versus the revision in the later edition, that I read:
However, all people - gay or otherwise - must recognize that there is one universal truth of the universe:WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE.(UNLESS YOU'RE ASEXUAL, OBVS)
After the first few chapters there seems to be a dramatic switch from teaching cishet people about what it means to be LGBTQ+ to telling LGBTQ+ youth the ""correct way"" to be LGBTQ+. I disagree with this sentiment.
Unless you identify as a lesbian yourself, you should never use the word ""dyke"" at all.
This is a message that is emphasised throughout the book and is something I absolutely disagree with. You cannot police the language of the LGBTQ+ community and then tell me, in the same breath, that sexuality and gender is a fluid and unique experience. I am a trans man who is bisexual, do you think that I have never been called a dyke in my life? Do I not have the right to reclaim that word for myself after it was used to attack me in my youth? Do you honestly believe that lesbians have never had fag yelled at them in the street? What about bisexual women, are they allowed to call themselves dykes? If sexuality and gender are the fluid constructs that we know them to be, you cannot tell people which words they can and cannot use to empower themselves with. If you are cishet, do not use these words. But if you are a member of the LGBTQ+ community, please, go wild. Own them. Empower yourself and use these words for good. Do not use them to harm others, be respectful. The content of this book can be down right dangerous if LGBTQ+ youth do not apply critical thinking, take it as gospel, and then turn on others in the community.Additionally, it tries (and fails) to traverse a delicate subject through humour to reach the people who are uncomfortable discussing these issues. It keeps on missing the mark. So many ""jokes"" are poorly misjudged and I physically shuddered at a lot of the language used. Perhaps this just isn't my style of humour, but I got secondhand embarrassment from reading it. Also, the constant font changes and capitalisation of words made it difficult to take seriously.It might be a good starting place for people who are new into LGBTQ+ identities, but please don't accept this writing unchallenged. Essentially what I mean is: don’t stop here, make sure to read around the subject more.Redeeming featuresOne of the core messages of the book is uplifting and accepting. You can be anything or anyone, and that's okay. Even though I disagreee with much of the content and have mixed feelings on how binary it feels, credit where it's due.There were also excerpts from many LGBTQ+ indviduals scattered throughout the book, including some longer stories. I enjoyed these a lot and wished there were more of them. I think there should have been a far more collaborative effort on this book from a group of diverse writers. A generalised book on LGBTQ+ history and identities by hundreds of LGBTQ+ people of different races, disabilities, genders, sexualities, etc is what I was hoping for, but that is not what I got.Show more"

I have accepted my sexuality, and it was a painful process.I suppose I'm still not 100 % okay with it yet, and I only think that because of my hesitance to look masculinebut the funny thing isI look masculine no matter what I'm wearing, even if it's a shirt with a flower on itand I think part of hte reason I have this hesitance is because my mom has always made it clear that she is okay with me wearing what I like, but also if I wear something she doesn't approve of she lets me know about it, and also if I happen to dress more feminine, she gets SO happy, like, ""Wow! you look so pretty! you should dress like this more often!""and like what even is genderwhy do I hate skirts so much?why is it that when I wear flannel, people take one look at me and are like, ""Oh.""shit's whack.anyway this book was great! I had seen this book many times before at Barnes and Noble, but never bought it because I didn't want to pay full price for itand then I went to a used book store and saw it for half offand never looked backThis book was a lot of fun to read!The person who wrote this book really poured her heart into itand it's told likeyou know, that cool teacher who explains stuff to you, but makes it fun, but also like gets real when it's necessaryyeah.it was good shit! and like most of it is stuff that I already knew, likewhat each sexuality is, stereotypes, how to meet other people like youbut sometimes there was also some stuff where it was like, oh. yeah I needed to hear that again.like the part where it was talking about different theories people had on where homosexuality came from, but the bottom line was, ""IT DOES NOT MATTER""or the part where she goes into self-expression, and figuring out how to dress, and how some gay men tend to dress extra masculine, possibly because they were raised to hate gay people or feminine thingsand the bottom line was to just be true to yourself. and if people think of you as gay, then you might as well own it.so, lads, looks like it's time for me to invest in some more flannel.anywaymy only criticism of the book is that being gayidkthis book talks about how people think about having sex with people of the same gender, and realizing they're gay, and trying out straight sex but realizing that they're not straightand that's all fine and wellbutto me it means more of falling in love with the right person.like, have I had thoughts of uhhh fooling around with women?i mean, yeahwas that part of what helped me realize I was bi?yeah, totally.but idk, what about the gay people who fall in love with a person before they have physical desires towards them, you know?idk if I'm making sense.anyway this book was a great timeI loved the charts, illustrations, and jokes.I learned a lot too, especially about being transgender, and how in some countries you can have sex changing surgeries, but they will sterilize you.and also there are many countries still where being gay is a crime that could lead to jail or death.that shit blows.anyway, check it out, I read a non-fiction book :p XDgood show, old sport.also I really liked this book, but was it amazing? what is necessary for five stars? idkShow more"

It's great to have an accessible, supportive, and uplifting take on the breadth of gay culture available for tween and teens when they are most vulnerable if just beginning to identify as LGBTQIA+. I really applaud the author and publishers for this concept.Dawson's writing style is diffident, engaging, and slyly puts information across without the patronisation of those PDSE lessons in school. I enjoyed her sense of humour, which managed to remain sensitive at all times. ""You're basically a HARP SQUID, and one of your tentacles is being lesbian or gay, but you have many more parts."" She satirises the many myths which surround the LGBT community, from stereotypes, to STIs, to tabloid scaremongering attempts to pinpoint the gay gene. ""All of these theories seem to have us programmed to be GAY or STRAIGHT before we were even born."" At no point is she judgemental, and I think having sexual health advice for under 18s is really important, especially advise which incorporates recent innovations such as swipe dating apps. All the major problems a young LGBTQIA+ person could face relating to their sexuality are dealt with, but I felt the overall message of this book was incredibly uplifting. It's also about making sure that people don't end up defining themselves by their sexuality and undervalung other aspects of themselves. ""It's human nature to label things, giving a name to the situation may make you feel better because you can be part of things."" And it's also about all the ways that discrimination can be overcome, and a happy healthy life lived.Only reservations - this is a hugely ambitious topic for a single book to cover and still remain accessible. Sometimes the terminology is simplified to make the narrative simpler, but there are places where this does affect meaning, such as using the word ""transvestite"" where ""cross-dresser"" is now more widely accepted. Also asexual and non-binary identities only receive a cursory mention in this book, and there is little over of gender disphoria issues for trans people, which is often as or more troubling for young trans people than the reactions they will receive from other people. Although it is sad that any one book will never be able to represent everyone, I think that Dawson covers the most common LGBTQIA+ identities with great depth and in context of the surrounding culture.A really important read for young LGBTQIA+ people who are struggling with where to begin finding out more about themselves and their culture. There's nothing else like it with anywhere near this high a profile on the market in the UK, a really essential and fun asset.Show more"

He sent me some screenshots about different pages just after reading the small fragments I could already guess they book was not going to be of my liking. Based on his interest, I decided to give it a chance but I was proven right and by chapter 5 I had had enough.The first impression you get is that the book is out-dated, like it was written by someone open-minded but heavily uneducated trying their best to explain LGTB stuff to people in the early's 2000. But when you check it out, the book was written in 2015 which absolutely gives no justification to such mistakes. This book brags about inclusivity, and not only lacks it but it can be even described as transphobic. Although it repeats, page after page that any sexual orientation or gender identity is valid, it contradicts itself in the body of the book. First of all, although it promises to speak about the LGTB matters, it focuses mainly on cis male gay matters, sometimes mentions lesbians and poorly describes the rest of orientations or identities in the LGTB. I personally think this is a mistake after the bragging in the introduction, but I guess it could be ignored if it were not for the fact that when included, all the other are wrongly presented. The truth is the book is highly binary. It erases the non binary spectrum in both the orientation (bisexuality) and identity (non binary people) subjects.It confirms a given set of stereotypes that are not true, it defends that bisexuals and asexuals are valid but then when explaining why bisexuals are attracted to more than one gender says: ""who does not want to have sex with everybody"", which invalidates asexuality and defends that all bisexuals are the same in terms of sexuality and also gives the message that they do not really care who they are with.Finally, and the most clear thing is that the book is transphobic. Although it says trans people are valid from time to time, it assumes a direct relationship between genitals and identities. For example, instead of saying that lesbians do not feel attracted to men, it says that they do not like penises, invalidating trans woman. The most surprising thing is that the edition I got was written when the author identified (it is written in the book) as a white gay cis man, but looking for more info I found out she came out as trans woman the year after publishing the book. I sincerely hope that the author being trans does not make uneducated people on the matter think that the representation given in the book is appropiate. It could not be further from it and such thought is dangerous. And I really hope the author has become aware of the transphobic commentaries since then and formed a better idea on the rest of the matters. I wish they would consider a new edition changing all the mistakes.But until they do, this book is addressed to gay cis men that are starting to find themselves, but I would not recommend it even for them as it gives a very bad representation about the rest of the LGTB colective.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16836851-connie,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"January 2, 2015",1 like,0,"More of a 4.5, but alas, Goodreads does not have that option.This is my first non-fiction read of 2015, and most certainly won't be my last- it's a brilliant start towards what I'm hoping will be a big shelf or two full of interesting books that look at topics that I feel strongly about. This one centres around LGBT+ (obviously). One thing that I enjoyed the most about this read was the fact that, even though it's a very educational read, it was done in a fun way- it wasn't your typical text-book, here-are-the-facts-and-nothing-more, kind of book that, say, a school book based on this would have (haha, like schools would have any books about things like this). James Dawson writes in a way that just kept me intrigued (and giggling)- he wrote about the fun side to being part of this minority (only 5% of people in the UK identify as LGBT+, which is surprising, before I remembered some people choose not to come out), while also showing how, sometimes, the world is not so fun when it comes down to it. Particularly the section on STI's and countries around the world where falling under this spectrum is seen as a criminal offence. It has an almost discussion like tone to it- he writes as if he's speaking to a friend, or a student ('cray' made an appearance and I almost died laughing), and I loved that. The only problem I had was that, at times, it got a bit too chummy and happy- there were some topics where he made a comment and I felt a bit uncomfortable that it was made. It's also come to my understanding that transgender people disapprove of the term 'transvestite' and see it as a slur, a derogatory term, but I understand that he might not have been aware of this at the time of writing- he shows nothing but respect for all people throughout this.Another strong point was that it was directed at people who identify as lesbian, gay, bi or transgender (although mostly gay men, seeing as he is one)- it includes information about clubbing, using dating websites like Grindr, and even different ways couples of the same sex can adopt. I really liked that there was also a section on how you can come out to family members, as well as including people's own experiences (mostly older people wishing to share their insight in to the world to younger people, who may have only just come out). As someone who's quite young and is at a time where I'm questioning how I want to identify (at the moment, bi, but that can always change- like Dawson says, your identity is fluid and you shouldn't have to stick to it just because everyone says you should or would disapprove if you changed your mind about how you identify), I felt like this was very informative and made me feel a lot better about myself and only furthered my enthusiasm in to becoming involved in the LGBT+ community, and protecting it from homophobic bigots. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants more of an insight in to this community, whether you be LGBT+, or straight/cis (if you're looking for help on understanding maybe a family or friends' sexuality, James Dawson has a chapter dedicated to acceptance).

I have only read one other James Dawson novel, Under My Skin, which I read two weeks ago. I absolutely loved Under My Skin and knew I had to read more by James so I picked up This Book Is Gay and can honestly say that James Dawson is on his way to becoming one of my favorite authors! I am hoping to pick up some of his other novels this summer.This Book Is Gay is a wholly inclusive novel. This novel covers so many topics, while focusing on the LGBT+ , there are many references to a variety of different sexual orientations such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, asexual etc., and all are explained simply and discussed thoroughly in the novel. James does well to not put too much of a rigid definition on each sexual orientation and guides the reader through the novel in an open way. I really enjoyed the statistics and facts James included in the novel as they really grounded the reader and made me go away from the novel and think.The illustrations in the book were also very fun and the chapter titles made me laugh out loud! I also enjoyed the witty and humorous approach the author took to what could have been a very serious book. My favorite part of the novel was when the author discussed why people would be opposed to homosexuality and he discussed the religious argument against homosexuality and challenged this. I think this is the most referenced argument to marriage equality at the minute in Ireland as a result of the upcoming referendum and it was really interesting to see James look on how to argue against their argument. I think this book should be read by some of the people opposed to marriage equality in Ireland. I think this book is honestly one of the best I've read on this subject. The subject matter is so topical and honestly just something everyone needs to be more understanding and aware of. Honestly one of the funniest, most entertaining and all encompassing novels I've read on sexuality ever.  Hopefully the marriage equality referendum is passed in Ireland, so please vote YES to equality all my Irish followers of age! I will definitely be reading more James Dawson in the near future, probably over the summer when my college exams are finished! So please leave a recommendation below of which of is novels I should read next! Show more"

Die Rede ist von “How to be gay” von Juno Dawson.Dieses Buch habe ich schon im englischen Original gelesen und war sehr auf die Übersetzung gespannt. Aber bevor wir weiter darauf eingehen solltet ihr erst einmal erfahren worum es hier geht.OFFEN, UNBESCHWERT UND SELBSTBEWUSST Das ultimative Sachbuch zu Sex und Identität * Wie fühlt es sich an, zum ersten Mal in ein Mädchen verliebt zu sein, wenn man selbst ein Mädchen ist? Und was passiert dann? Wie findet man andere schwule Jungs? Kann sich deine Geschlechtsidentität von deinem biologischen Geschlecht unterscheiden? Mit über hundert Originalbeiträgen von lesbischen, schwulen, bi- und transsexuellen Jugendlichen, die ein unendliches Spektrum sexueller Identitäten repräsentieren. WORAUF WARTET IHR NOCH – LIEBT EUCH!* WARNING: Honestly explicit in parts! Dieses Buch räumt auf mit Klischees und wahnwitzigen Irrtümern über Liebe und Sex jenseits von hetero und sagt ehrlich, was wirklich Sache ist. Es ist ein Buch für außergewöhnliche, einzigartige und total normale Leute wie dich, mich, deine beste Freundin und ihren Cousin.Klappentext “How to be Gay” – Juno DawsonZu erst muss ich sagen, dass “ultimative Sachbuch zu Sex und Identität” etwas sehr hoch gegriffen ist. Ja, das Buch ist wichtig. Vor allem für die Leser, die sich an das Thema herantasten wollen. Aber als “ultimativ” würde ich es nicht bezeichnen wollen. Nicht nur, weil ich das nicht einschätzen kann, sondern kann es nur “ultimativ” sein, mit Menschen aus diesen Personengruppen zu reden bzw. diesen zuzuhören. Das kann einem kein Buch vermitteln.Ich persönlich habe bis lang kein Titel in diese Richtung gelesen und kann somit das Buch auch nicht mit andere vergleichen. Daher finde ich aber auch, dass es ein guter Einstieg ist. Für mich war alles verständlich und auch interessant. Aber jemand, der sich schon länger bzw. intensiver mit diesen Thematiken auseinander setzt wird wohl eher gelangweilt sein.Die Illustrationen in dem Buch finde ich gut und lockern das Ganze sehr gut auf. Es hat mich sehr gefreut, dass das auch so übernommen wurde.Man sollte bei dem Titel auch bedenken, dass sich die Autorin auch auf die Situation in Großbritannien bezieht, das wurde aber auch im Buch noch einmal als Hinweis abgedruckt. Und die Adressliste am Ende ist an unsere Region angepasst worden.Mein Fazit: Informatives Buch, welches Neueinsteiger in die Thematik gut empfängt und mit nimmt. Ich hoffe sehr, dass es sehr viele lesen würden.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8159106-beatriz,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"January 8, 2015",1 like,0,"*3.5 stars First off I have to say that I really appreciate/admire what this book set out to do. There are so few books about/for the LGBT community, let alone younger members of the LGBT community. It's awesome to see books like this being made. As a straight cis woman I am perhaps not the intended audience for this book, however I am glad I read it as I learned a lot of things I didn't know about the LGBT community, making me a more aware ally (Dawson makes this point in the intro as well). This is a good read, informative and thorough and presents the information in an approachable and often humorous way. Despite its many great qualities this book is not without fault. Right at the start of the book James Dawson discusses stereotypes of the LGBT community and how stereotypes suck and no one likes to be pigeonholed into an identity. However, throughout the book he makes some very wide generalizations and pigeonholes people (by saying things such as EVERYONES sexuality is fluid, EVERYONE likes sex, ALL GAY ALL LESBIANS etc). It really pissed me off that this book is about acceptance and becoming aware of the nuances of people yet he goes and makes these hugely generalizing statements. Another issue was the language used. I don't know if he was trying to be silly or whatever, but when writing about human genitalia he used terms such as willy, fanny, bits and more. THIS IS SO FUCKING IRRITATING and one of my biggest pet peeves. PENIS & VAGINA & BREASTS etc. is that so difficult? We're all mature here, why can't we use the proper terminology for our bodies?For a book that is supposed to be about equality and inclusion and acceptance there were several bits with a lot of body shaming. For example Dawson, when describing gay clubs or dating apps, urged participants to look their best as no one wants a fat, balding uggo (paraphrasing). Or this one ""Porn stars are selected on the basis of their fantastic bodies, huge willies and fake boobs. Not many people look like that in real life, and you probably wouldn't want to hang out with those who did."" pg. 172 Seriously? Are we shaming people for having large penises and fake breasts? Screw that. I am not okay with the subtle (and often overt) body shaming that goes on in this book. Lastly, this book tired to be inclusive of the whole LGBT spectrum, yet it was really biased towards gay cis men (which the author is). James Dawson could've brought in guest authors or something to be more inclusive and thorough in his discussion and inclusion of people other than cis gay men. Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4882193-paul,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"September 11, 2022",0,0,"From the blurb:There's a long-running joke that, after ""coming out,"" a lesbian, gay guy, bisexual, or trans person should receive a membership card and instruction manual. THIS IS THAT INSTRUCTION MANUAL. You're welcome.""This Book Is Gay"" is one of a number of young adult books targeted by right-wing culture warriors. They view it, along with other LGBTQ-themed books, as insidious pro-gay propaganda designed to lure girls and boys into deviant sex and transgenderism. This book in particular, billed as an ""instruction manual"" for LGBTQ youth (see the blurb, above), has been in their crosshairs for several years.Since its publication in 2014, ""This Book Is Gay"" has been challenged, and sometimes banned, from classrooms and school libraries in several states. In 2021, the American Library Association listed it as the ninth-most challenged title in the U.S.A. One notable challenge and resultant banning was recorded in 2016, when the public library in Wasilla, Alaska, was forced to relocate its entire young adult nonfiction collection to restricted shelves in response to threats from the community over ""This Book Is Gay"":Several Wasilla residents attacked the book at a city council meeting saying that “they didn’t want ‘gay books’ or books about gay people in the library at all.” For defending the sex education book for teens, the library director was branded as a pedophile in the highly controversial public debates.My comments:""This Book Is Gay"" is at its best in providing useful information for curious gay boys and teens; less so for other groups on the LGBTQ spectrum. Multiple reviewers on Amazon and Goodreads say the same, judging by comments posted by lesbian, bisexual, gender fluid, non binary, and asexual readers. To be fair, Juno herself admits she's stronger in certain areas than others.The main thrust of ""This Book Is Gay"" is helping young folks who suspect or know they're different feel better about being different, with useful hints on how to find friends who feel the same. In this, the book is similar to several other LGBTQ-themed YA books under attack around the country.Juno goes a bit further, though, offering specific and practical advice on how to find and meet like-minded people for socializing and sex. Some of her advice is tailored specifically for teenagers in high school. She frankly describes the different ways gay men and women bring their partners to orgasm. She includes illustrations (not of sex acts, but of bodies), less graphic than those in ""Fun Home"" and ""Gender Queer,"" graphic novels that feature in other book-banning attempts.Juno includes chapters on the dangers of promiscuous gay sex, STIs, genital diseases, and AIDS, and includes a thoughtful final chapter with advice for parents of children coming out as gay and/or transgender. The overall tone is friendly, intimate, and upbeat: Juno's an out and experienced gay person with answers, encouragement, and advice for gay- and bi-curious teenagers, a Dan Savage for the younger set.On the down side, Juno downplays the very legitimate fears of kids considering coming out. Never mind countries and cultures where being gay or transgender is literally illegal, even punishable by death, gay kids in North America and Europe are still ostracized, sometimes thrown out on the streets by their own parents, shunned by former friends and churches. It happens all the time, even today. Yes, Juno lists countries where being gay will get you killed, advising kids in Nigeria, for example, to stay in the closet for their own good, but in the next chapter and the ones after that, she makes light of these concerns and promises readers that coming out will be one of the most positive and freeing experiences they'll ever have. From my own observation as an outsider, coming out can be fraught with danger, even for kids in liberal enclaves within tolerant Western societies.I like that Juno addresses the importance of vocabulary, including acknowledging that tortured constructions like ""cisgender"" and ""cishet"" come from wanting to divorce sexual orientation and gender identity from the tyranny of ""normal."" When default majority sexual orientation and gender identity is labeled normal, what's left quickly becomes ""abnormal"" and eventually ""deviant."" I get that and always have, but apparently a lot of folks don't, so in a book addressing gender identity and sexual orientation, it's helpful to point out to straight, er, cishet readers how harmful and discriminatory vocabulary choices can be.Why this book should remain on high school and public library shelves, accessible without restrictions to teenaged readers:High school kids already have access to tons of information on gay sex, gay lifestyles, sexual orientation, gender identity and the steps one can take to change it. Not to mention online access to straight, bi, and gay pornography. If my long-ago experience as a teenager in high school is a guide, teens today have already studied that material, and more.You can't call anything in ""This Book Is Gay"" pornographic while keeping a straight face. Juno describes basic sexual acts clinically but never pruriently. You can pretty much read the same sort of thing in any other advice book for gay and transgender youth, not that there's much of that out there (which is why Juno wrote the book in the first place).This may be coming at it sideways, but I cheer when Billy Bob Thornton puts on a CPAP mask at night in the TV series Goliath. When I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, it felt like a weird, shameful weakness, something akin to erectile disfunction. And you never saw anyone sleeping with a CPAP on TV. After Goliath I felt less alone, less embarrassed.You don't know how important representation is until you're the isolated minority, finally seeing people like you in books and on the screen. Imagine how empowering and validating those first prime-time TV series featuring Black actors were to Black viewers. Or how important books like ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" are to Native American kids. Or how meaningful and affirming ""This Book Is Gay"" will be, and is, to thousands of frightened gay and transgender kids, every one of whom thinks he or she is the only kid in the world with the same feelings. Wouldn't you rather they read ""This Book Is Gay"" than log onto Pornhub? (As if we don't all know they'll do both and there's nothing we can do about it anyway.)I'll leave you with a link to a recent news story. It's about a prominent member of the main group urging angry ""parents"" and armed Proud Boy thugs to disrupt school and library board meetings to protest ""This Book Is Gay"" and other LGBTQ books: Moms for Liberty Activist Wants LGBTQ Students Separated into Special Classes.Because that's what this shit is all about. It's not the books. It's never the books. It's the kids who are different they're after. How are you going to react when they come after yours?p.s. If you decide to read the book yourself and go looking for a copy at your library or on Amazon, you may be confused by early editions listing ""James Dawson"" as the author. Dawson was a gay man at the time of writing and publication. She has since transitioned and new editions bear her new name, Juno Dawson. Since we're talking about the author, here's a link to her thoughts on the attacks on ""This Book Is Gay"": ""

As someone who supports said community but didn't know a lot about it, I gained quite a bit of knowledge. Ultimately, I am glad I took the time to read this book.Dawson covers a lot of ground in here. Maybe too much? I feel like there were some chapters that could have or should have been giving more info. But I am not the author and I am sure he made the decisions he did for a reason. He approaches everything with a lighthearted and humorous flair. I think with audience he is targeting that is needed. Especially trying to appeal to a teen who may not be ready to commit to any specific identity or societal restraints. For me, it got a bit tiring. And by the end of the book...things felt repetitive.But I did enjoy it and, again, I learned quite a bit. A lot of progress has been made in terms of the world vs LGBT, but we still have a long way to go. Sadly it's more spewed hate and prejudices that keeps us from moving forward. In the end, we are all human. My hope is that more of us will begin to base actions on this thought process instead of ignoring it. Would I recommend this book? Well...I'm stepping out with what I am about to say and taking a stance. Short answer: Everyone should read it. But the people who need to most likely never will due to a belief or discomfort with the topic. That, my friends is just sad not just for those unwilling but for LGBT.Long answer: I believe this book generates thought processes we need when thinking about teens. The question shouldn't be where do they go to get information about LGBT/their identity. The question should be where CAN they go? Sadly one place I would think they could (school) is still not the safest territory in a lot of cases. Those barriers are still yet to be completely broken. My heart aches for anyone afraid to come out. It is heartbreaking to know teens struggle with this and the dark places/roads it can lead to.

He doesn't judge and I admire that. The humor is excellent. I think this could have taught things to 14 year old me.

The community is crammed with entirely different people. He mentions this but doesn't go in depth. Talk about genderqueer people, talk about pansexual and the difference between them and bisexual, talk about ace/aro folks and the struggles they face with finding solid relationships, talk about the problems with prostitution and generally sexual abuse in the community, talk about being your own gay regardless of the culture, talk about other dating sites that aren't from gay men, talk about nonbinary folks and gender pronouns, talk about the intersections between gay rights, women's rights and equal racial rights, talk about the gray scale and demisexuality and the huge difference between romantic attraction and sexual attraction. It's very tumblr of me to say this but oh well. This book is excellent for gay men. It's often said that in the community, gay men fare the best so I'd hoped this book would be this massive guide for every type of gay. It's not. I want to love this book. I really did. I want this book to be that guide for new people in the community. I can't stand for the erasure of so many of the community (14 year old me felt finally comfortable when she heard about asexual and the gray scale, so thanks but no thanks to this book). Read it and then read more. Don't stop listening to everyone from the community. what I'm taking with me  • SAFE SEX ALWAYS GUYS AND GALS. • Alan Turing committed suicide after going through chemical castration. And he was gay.

To say that the citing of specific studies is few and far between would be an understatement. The entire chapter on biology made so many claims that weren’t substantiated by any actual evidence; simply the phrases “studies have shown…” and “research shows that…”. Later on in the book there are also a few tables discussing LGBT persecution, and one table in particular really bothered me: “Countries that officially have legal rights for LGBT+ people, but LGBT+ people face persecution,” which goes on to list Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Poland, & Russia. While at first glance this might seem fine… the author never defines what “persecution” is; not to mention, never describes her methodology for assembling this and the other tables in the book. If she defined her terms, maybe I wouldn’t be complaining, but that list looks awfully small! These are only a few examples of these occurrences, but while reading this book, I couldn’t help but think how if I, as a college undergrad, ever presented data in one of my papers the way that this author presented her data, I would be (rightfully) torn apart by any college professor who takes their job even slightly seriously. Another issue, this book, while giving a nice review of queer life, is also pretty outdated. The book might’ve been super accurate in 2014, but it doesn’t hold up quite so well almost a decade later— which is fine, culture is always evolving; but, this should still be kept in mind, since the self branded “gay instruction manual” might be an outdated source for anyone trying to understand queerness (especially Gen Z queerness) in 2022 and onward. Overall, it pains me to be so harsh in my review, as this book really is full of heart, and the author’s sentiment is really felt throughout the work— but my grievances referenced above really robbed any pleasure I could’ve extracted from reading This Book is Gay.

As a queer person (I am a genderqueer demigirl who is also demipansexual and quoiromantic) who has identified as such for many years, I didn't think that I would actually get anything out of this book. Boy, was I wrong!Juno Dawson's very personal and keen insight into her own as well as her fellow queer people's lives inspired me to revisit the bisexual-or-pansexual . . . issue? debate? . . . and really think critically as I questioned my opinions and my identity. Formerly, I identified as a bisexual person. I still sort of dislike the term ""pansexual"" because of biphobia, because trans* folx are their proper gender, because the term ""bisexual"" still works under the ""your gender as well as other genders"" definition, and because parts actually kinda do matter to me because I like different folx for really different reasons (even though GEEZ I LIKE THEM ALL) . . . All that said, reading Juno's book has changed my perspective a bit, and I am very grateful for it.If you are curious about the bisexual-or-pansexual topic, here is an article that resonates deeply with me: https://radicalbi.wordpress.com/2011/...Anyway, I really do love and believe in this book. I am recommending it to everyone, queer or cishet. My cisgendered, heterosexual boyfriend has been asking me about my queerness, about what it means for our relationship, and this book was just a godsend. It put words to so many of my thoughts! I also recommended it to one of my co-workers, who suspects that a member of her family may be gay and isn't sure what to do or how to approach it, and to one of my students (I am a paraprofessional—or teacher's aide—who works with middle schoolers) who is trans*[to-be-determined]. It's an incredible baseline for anyone new to accepting their identity, anyone questioning their identity and/or their orientation, anyone who is curious about what it means to be queer; it is invaluable.Seriously. Everyone should read this book!Show more"

I really wanted to like it, but it's just. Not good. There are so many flaws in this book, but it all boils down to hyperfocusing on cis gay men 90% of the book. Sure, there is a brief mention on asexuality, but then when talking about sex says things like 'Everyone wants to have sex!'There's a brief mention of nonbinary identities, but for the rest of the book exclusively uses phrases like 'Both genders'.There are some mentions of trans identities, but when talking about men, women, and sexual attraction between them, every time says that men have penises and women have vaginas. Trans identities are very much an afterthought in every part of this book.There are mentions of bisexuality (none for pansexuality unfortunately), but exclusively refers to m/f relationships and sex as 'straight' and f/f or m/m relationships and sex as 'gay'.Every single part of this book misses the mark completely and never does a good job of including any identities other than cis gay men. (Lesbians are also included a lot, but often inaccurate or attached with harmful remarks).It's a book published in 2013, so up to a certain point i can understand that things change 7 years and not everything can be included, but 99% of these things AREN'T NEW. these are things that have existed and (mostly) accepted in most of the LGBTQIA+ community. the only change is that they're becoming more broadly accepted by society in general, which means it's more of a subject. BUT STILL, if you're writing a book to educate people on the queer community and queer lives, i would expect you'd do your research and learn about these things.Show more"

He gives you definitions and talks a little about each aspect of the acronym. But he honestly, slowly just starts veering off and talks mostly about bi and gay men(he still talks about lesbians some, but he has an expert say some things and then basically lesbian and bi women are pushed off to the background of the white gay male). He did really well with including sections on Transsexuals at first, but again like the homosexual and bisexual women, it all just became background.As for the QIA aspect, he basically did a little bit of a definition and then hey it was like those letters no longer existed. The book was funny and insightful and even opened my eyes about some things. buuuuuut, I honestly think I would have liked this book more if he hadn't tried to include the TQIA section in the beginning. (I AM NOT SAYING THAT OVERLOOKING ANYONE IN THE LGBTQIA IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. THE HETEROSEXUAL COMMUNITY DOES THAT ENOUGH AS IT IS. But he made it obviously clear that he was either not well educated/researched on the TQIA section or that he was a bit more biased about what he wanted in his book. Which is fine, it is his book and he can write what he wants. But like I said, it becomes obviously clear that (especially) the QIA individuals are being overlooked completely other than a quick introduction at the beginning.

Anyway, something caught my eye: even after going through some kind of proof-reading before re-publishing the book under the author's new name, there were still many mentions of being a gay man. But the serious mistakes were the several cases of transphobia, specially because the author is actually trans! WTF. Phrases like lesbians like vaginas, ignoring that there are women with penises or implying that if there's a penis, there's a man, also ignoring that there are men with vaginas.Maybe that was the author's internalised transphobia when she still identified as a gay man, but I cannot know for sure. It was pretty shocking, to be honest.Other than that, which is a very big that, the book was informative for someone who is not much into LGBT+ topics and very supportive for those still questioning their identities, told in a funny way. As I had an issue with the transphobic comments, I lowered my rating.

It includes so many things that are important to me: different sexualities like asexuality; feminism; sexism; arguments on why religion has nothing to do if gay couples should get married or not; representation of LGBT* in the media and more.This book tells you how to talk to your parents, how to argue about your points and it educates you. It made me feel a bit more like a part of this community and I appreciate that a lot. Of course the book isn't perfect, you could argue that here and there James Dawson could have chosen a different sentence or whatever, but that's rarely the case. The said he's not an expert in everything and he's not trying to tell other people about the things he can't possible understand. He started a survey before writing this book and it's very interesting to read the opinions of so many people, to get a glimpse in their life and to see how different they are, how they deal with being LGBT*, what problems they have encountered but also what great things they had in their lives. This is a book you can smack into every homophobe's (or transphobe's) face. It will not only hurt but then they can open it and READ and maybe stop trying to be assholes.I can recommend this to literally everyone. You don't have to be L, G, B, T or *.

This certainly wasn’t the case with this book. It made me laugh out loud and it made me appreciate what some people experience because they are LGBT. It didn’t matter to me that I was reading this book as a heterosexual. I don’t think it matters whatever sexual preference you have and that’s a bloomin’ fantastic thing.

I imagine that this book is going to be a massive support to those that are struggling with their identity- teenagers or adults. James’ writing makes you feel like you’re talking to a friend that’s giving you some well thought out and intelligent advice.

I think genderqueer got used once, but it was conflated more so with gender non-conforming. non-binary, genderfluid, genderqueer, etc are not included in the list of / definitions for LGBT+ identitiesasexual does get included in the list, but the definition is wrong. Dawson says asexual people have little interest in or desire for sex, then says asexual people MAY have sex, but only to please a partner or try for kids. she also says she's seen a lot of teenagers identify as asexual while figuring out their orientationso. idiot parent sticks their head in the room for three seconds, sees ""the young folk"" are doing something new, and then just sort of toddles off with their own assumptions about it without ever actually asking anyone what it is or what they're doing(the definition of asexual is ""does not experience sexual attraction."" if you just define it as ""doesn't want to have sex,"" then any other statements about it not being abstinence or how asexual people can still have sex just sounds stupid and confusing. The Pride Guide does a much better job of explaining this, and even gives a decent example of how you may still want to eat cake--bc it's yummy--even if you're not hungry, versus someone going on a diet or hunger strike.)Dawson's definition for bisexual: ""bisexual people want to have sex with both men and women."" again, he's just completely forgotten about any other gender or lack thereof, and also it's pretty suspicious that gay and lesbian get language like ""attracted to"" or ""interested in"" while bisexual people get ""want to have sex with"" *thinking face* HMMMMMpansexual is not included in the list, despite having at least one quote (that I specifically remember) from someone who says they identify as ""pan"" and a brief reference in the text that said something like ""bisexual and pan people."" also a little weird that ""pansexual"" itself was never used, just ""pan""??SUPER outdated language for everything about transgender people. even for 2015. repeated use of ""transgendered"" and even ""transgenderism"" as a headline. never ACTUALLY defines it though??the section on Transgender first of all starts with ""Why are transgender people in this book"" and this is real. yeah, Dawson uh ... ""defends"" our right to be here, but I'd honestly rather she just. shut up. at that pointafter that, she says ""Let's get this straight first of all"" and then """"defines"""" transgender in the most lackluster terms possible. ""an umbrella term for anyone who experiments with or moves between gender."" which is possibly the weirdest, most non-definition definition I've ever seen. the next definition is transsexual though, which she continues to use as the default word for transgender people throughout the book, that was published in 2015 actually, and not like,, 2005. or 1995. she defines that as ""A person who feels they were born into the wrong gender. Will sometimes seek to correct their gender, sometimes with surgery.""so Dawson clearly thinks ""transsexual"" is the actual term and ""transgender"" is just some woo-woo shit thrown in on top of that. maybe this is just a product of someone out of the loop writing from 5+ years ago, and that's why it seems so painfully dated and misinformed now, but I was already an adult and active in the community in 2015, and we were all using transgender then too. ""transsexual"" had already been phased out and considered a borderline slur by 2015, in my experience, and this was my experience in the Bible Beltanother direct quote: ""I cannot state this enough: lesbians like vaginas.""like some other reviews have said, this is great for gay men. good for lesbians. possibly-good for bisexual people too, if you don't mind her weird pity-attitude with actual phrases like ""poor bisexuals, left out in the cold."" and then it's like Dawson just skimmed on everything else, because how much research would she need to do?? at the time, Dawson identified as a GAY MAN, so clearly that represents the GAY COMMUNITY :) :)I would really only recommend this on the basis of the sexual education portion. it's also not super great for trans people, with very cissexist language on what a man and woman is / the genitals they OBVIOUSLY have, but it's otherwise educational and I think would answer a lot of questions teens might have on what sex acts actually are, how they work, using adult terms, and a good section on safe sex practices and STDs as wellShow more"

This is such an important yet quite frankly not addressed topic in LGBT+ books as the phrase 'That is so gay!' still exists. Secondly, I like that the author invited other people of all ages to talk about their experiences - which helped him to stop the book focusing on only gay men and to educate readers further whilst still talking about taboo topics. This Book is Gay is more aimed at LGBT+ people themselves instead of allies but it is still certainly a useful guide for everyone and I am so glad I read it because I didn't realise how much I didn't know and I feel like that now I know more, I'm on the road to becoming a better ally (I hope). Aside from just talking about what gay means etc.... he also talks about sexuality and religion and about the laws on sexuality, same-sex sex and gay marriage in countries.

In fact, I wish there were books this good for straight people to learn the ins and outs of sex and relationships! Be forewarned that there is direct talk about sexual activity in this book (""Doing the Sex""), which many people will find refreshingly informative, but some may not be interested, ready, or open enough to read yet, and that's fine. Dawson encourages these readers to skip this chapter, and I agree. The only criticism I would have is that as a gay man, the author speaks most knowledgeably and passionately to that audience, and I suspect does not do justice to all, glossing over topics that do not pertain to him.

The writer is clearly older than me, but is trying to sound hip and it just comes across as wrong. Also, as the writer is gay (and if I’m not mistaken, has a drag persona---He credits his female half [EDIT: The writer is a Trans-Woman, the published edition in the US just has not updated itself to reflect her coming out]), the books is a bit light on the rest of the LGBT bit. He attempts to balance this with statements from LGBT around the globe but really it falls short. There’s quite a bit about gay sex and the gay scene, but if you’re lesbian or not really into the gay scene (which is ok!), then there’s not as much there. Also this book is heavily bent toward a UK audience, which makes the audio-book a bit strange, especially with Britishisms and slang coming out of an American accented reader. Equally, certain laws and rights referred to, sadly only exist in the UK and not in the US. This can be a bit easy to confuse, so it’s disappointing that the US publisher did not think to have an Americanized edition published. Still, seeing the lack of LGBT intro books, it’s not horrible.

For the young person who is trying to cope with their identity, this can be a great guideline, and hopefully a tool to be more sure of who they are and who they want to be, no matter their sexuality or gender identity.For the parents and other grown-ups, this book is very informative about what the young people they might be dealing with every day may go through and struggle with. It can help these grown-ups to offer the best kind of support to the young people.The language in the book has a great flow and the illustrations are very entertaining, so it gets easy to read and get through.That being said, the book could easily have been much longer or have a sequel (if it's still called that when dealing with non-fiction) to work around other parts of the LGBT+ community, so even more people might have the feeling of being seen and represented here.Show more"

Sadly, it wasn't as inclusive as I hoped it to be. The topic of gender and other sexualities were barely talked about. Nonetheless, this book does offer a lot of important information on the topic of sexuality and safety for queer folks.I do not regret buying or reading it, but I still hoped for more information on other identities and sexualities. The main focus of the book was mostly on gay men, but also gay women.Even though Dawson does give some basic information on different groups within the LGBT* community the main focus was on the LGB part of the community. In conclusion I'd still recommend reading the book since it offers a lot of information regarding sexuality, political issues and safety for queer people regarding identity, coming out, dating and sex.Dawson is really open on these topics and the book offers education on topics where school's lacking.

But god the information is so so important and worth the read for ANYONE, I urge you to read this please. On the other hand, although this book (very very acutely) touched on being non-binary (in literally one sentence I believe) it'd be really interesting to see this worked further- as well as including more about those who are intersex, gender fluid, etc etc. As someone who is friends with a few non-binary people, I found that once I finished it I didn't feel it was very inclusive to them. Also, in a personal sense I found it was very fixed on strictly ""Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual"" and didn't really include the range- specifically for me pansexuality (obviously), but also asexuality, etc. Other than that I really enjoyed this and have a few people in-real-life I may recommend it to!Show more"

It's what every queer teen needs to hear - you are not bad - and what every parent needs to hear - this is not about you. Best quote in the book: ""it's not that your kid has changed, you're just finally seeing the whole picture."" ♥️If you're a parent trying to educate yourself to be more accepting and a better resource for your kid or any kid, read it (maybe skip the sex chapter). If you're a kid who is questioning read it all. If you're a human who wants to be a better advocate, regardless of age, read it (skip the sex chapter, it doesn't concern you), then buy a copy for your friends. I had wonderful family and friends when I came out. My joy in this book is not a ""damnit, they needed to read this,"" but rather ""I am so very glad this exists for all of us to read now and be better humans for future generations."" Keep in mind, this is not the end-all-be-all for queer culture and labels. But it is a very good start at demystifying the queer community on the road to inclusion.Show more"

Safety is promoted, and there are many resources at the end of the book for those seeking assistance/more information. Although I am very pro-intellectual freedom, I would probably save recommending this book for older teens and recommend alternatives to younger teens, due to the extremely blunt mature content.

But, those were the days of Section 28; being gay was odd enough and certainly nobody knew what a transsexual was. Now, there are better resources for gay, bi, trans and questioning young people, so how does this book stack up? It certainly knows its audience. Writing that has a 'down with the kids' style is often an awkward read, but this author pitches it right most of the time. It's certainly not stuffy. It's matter-of-fact, reassuring and deals with the big issues for a young gay person (gender, sexuality, self, friends, school, parents, religion, being safe). It's a bit light on trans matters, and a 'this book is trans' follow-up might be nice. But, copies of this should be in all school libraries, and required reading for all teachers who are not gay or trans themselves, so they have the basics - and especially the terminology - correct for when they need it.Show more"

Identities such as pansexual and asexual are given a passing mention (with barely a definition to their name) while the spectrum of asexuality is not at all explored meaning if a reader is Demisexual they will not be reading about themselves in this book.Furthermore, there is a list of terms at the back under which 'golden showers' and 'scat' are listed but non-binary is not - that just seems bizarre considering the intention of this book.However, I cannot slate it entirely as I guarantee that this book will tremendously help (and maybe even save the life of) any cis-gay male readers.Show more"

I don’t often give reviews, so I tried to break my thoughts down as concisely as possible.The Good:1. It’s so uplifting and positive at the idea of being yourself*.2. The provided links/information at the back is always appreciated.3. There is a lot of truth to certain societal expectations/norms that don’t get spoken of enough.4. The information about other countries felt very important and necessary to put perspective for those who do not know how dangerous being part of this minority group can be.5. The beginning focuses on inclusivity and pulling all types of readers in.6. The book is extremely accessible and is quite funny while also being informative.7. There is a great amount of “real life” individuals from the survey sharing their thoughts!8. The footnote at the back for adults was particularly helpful for someone like me who was partially reading this from a teaching lens.The Personally Disappointing:1. As a high school ELA teacher and a co-advisor for our school’s LGBT club, I had been hoping to find a read to suggest to my students. Alas, between the consistent mentioning of sex and said mentioning being done so in a humorous-but-inappropriate way, I will not be able to mention the book to my students as their teacher.2. As an asexual woman, I would’ve loved more (or actually any real) page time dedicated to being ace. Yes, the book is literally about being gay, but the beginning sets it up as inclusive, and like it or not, the LGBT community has a habit of “gay” being a catch-all term for all the identities. Especially during the chapters on sex, having SOME information about being asexual would’ve been amazing.The Bad:1. I feel this book is titled incorrectly; instead, it should be called “This Book is Gay and Horny”. Sex is fine and can be an important topic, but it isn’t everything in the community.2. The book is marketed from the get-go as a “guide to coming out”. And yes, the beginning gives some hints of that, but it turns into a hormone-induced discussion surrounding the idea of physical relationships pretty quickly and doesn’t back down from it really at all. Coming out and being attracted to people of the same sex are not the same thing, and this book is more of a guide to same-sex sex than how to be proudly yourself in public.3. *While this book is about being proud, it also latches onto some interesting generalizations. The different areas discussing sex really seem to assume everyone’s default is being horny a lot, wanting lots of partners to shake things up, and being wholly interested in all things physical. When it says “if not, that’s okay!” it still comes across as “Oh right some people may disagree, probably should put a disclaimer.” Not everyone, in any community, fits into generalizations. I understand how hard it can be to try and write about a group without generalizing, but entire chapters seemed to act as if gay individuals are SO DIFFERENT from straight individuals in terms of not wanting to settle down, have one partner, and maybe even have kids. That just doesn’t seem fair; represent both sides. It is possible.4. For the discussion at the beginning being about inclusivity, there was one heck of a gender binary and very little mention of anything not gay. Heck, even the lesbian discussions often seemed to say “same for girls, just lesbians instead of gays!” I wish it would have dropped the inclusivity claim and just focused on being gay and been upfront about that from the beginning.5. This opinion may be controversial as I do not know Juno Dawson personally, but more than once I was asking myself if she was writing not from the community’s perspective but her own. Again, the multitude of “ALL people want THIS VERY SPECIFIC THING” felt… odd. Almost like she was trying to justify her own feelings more than what the community as a whole genuinely feels.6. I do not know that I would classify this book in the young adult section. Not that I think teenagers can’t and don’t have physically intimate relationships, but more because MANY of the chapters essentially say “if you’re under 18, you won’t have this chance yet, but-“ which defeats the purpose of marketing to teenagers, right?7. This may belong in the personal disappointment section, but I actually think after finishing and seeing Juno was also a teacher that I’m putting it here. The book ridicules and criticizes schools for not giving proper education about same-sex sex/couples; how great would it have been had this book been school appropriate so the schools had a choice to provide some proper, real-world information? I suppose it just felt like it was leaning into the stereotype that learning about being gay is not school appropriate, but also ridiculing that very notion.The information seemed good, helpful, and important; however, I feel the marketing in the beginning was just false. Had we not put this in the young adult section and not pretended it was about anything other than being gay, I think this book could count as a 4.5/5 stars. Due to the marketing giving false expectations, though, the highest rating I can give this story is 3/5 stars, and that is namely for the sake of having ANY a information accessible for teenagers confused about being gay.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/148671534-pin,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"July 2, 2023",1 like,0,"I had such high hopes for this book... Even more when I found out it was written by a trans person. I went in, expecting and hoping to learn more about my community. This is supposed to be a book for teenagers and adults who want to learn about themselves, the community or how to be an Ally. Instead this book teaches queer people that they are disgusting creatures and all of their behavior is based on self-hatred. Everything in this book feels like it is not supposed to normalize queerness but instead give homophobes a base and a reason to hate on us. While there is a chapter about stereotypes and cliches it doesn't do much on trying to wipe them away or talk about how hurtful they are. The author instead chose to create more cliches and stereotypes and base them on complete hate within the community but also simple self-hatred. The author also stated that the book is all-inclusive towards the community which - surprise - it isn't. It mostly focuses on gay and lesbian relationships and also most of the time only on the binary spectrum of gender. Talking about gender... With the author being a trans woman I had so much hope for the Trans-Talks in this book. And they were (besides the aspectrum presentation) probably the most horrible of all. It talked more about insults towards trans people than the actual trans spectrum while ""Don't call people a 'tranny'. It's disrespectful and disgusting."" would have done the job. You basically don't learn anything about Transgender from this book, except the slurs. And even though homosexual relationships and their sex life got talked about plenty, the author didn't even really seem to bother including same-sex-attracted trans people into this talk. The one time it did happen (Chapter 9, part 3 ""Trans-Sex"") there barely was a mentioning about fetishization of trans people and their bodies or how dangerous certain situations in dating or sex can be for trans people. And yes, it is a horrible topic to even have to talk about but it is important that we talk about it. I find it incredible how ignorant this book is towards trans problems even though the author is trans herself. And then there is the problem of the gay-talks... I know that Juno Dawson wrote that book before she came out as trans and therefor still lived as a man to that time. However, I also know that this book got edited after her coming out. Still, the parts of her speaking on behalf of the gay community got not cut which I do not understand. As a woman, Juno Dawson has no right to talk on behalf of gay men/non-women interested in non-women. Therefor these parts should have been edited out of the script and she still could have talked about gay relationships that way (ignoring that the ""I'm gay as well"" parts kind of functioned as a ""I'm allowed to talk about gay people like this because I am gay so it's not disrespectful or homophobic"").The humor in this book... Not my cup of tea. Most of the time, it went way too far or even got too a point where you couldn't even count it as humor anymore. I had to close this book so often because I got too much second-hand-embarrassment or felt disgusted by the way Juno Dawson talked about different parts of the community. This book made me feel disgusted by myself, even though I am not easily affected by cliches or stereotypes or other things going in this direction. There was so much judgement in this book... The author condemned so many groups of people for basically no reason. All this book is doing is telling you how not to be, to be embarrassed and disgusted by yourself and to not be proud of your identity in any way, but instead to be ashamed. And, of course, a group of people that needs to be talked about so much more... The asexual community. For ace people, none of the advice, even if it would be good advice - which it isn't -, in this book would be helpful because it only seems to be useful or even apply if you feel sexual attraction and all you think about is riding dick all day (yes, dick, because even while being one of the main focuses, lesbian attraction was nearly not talked about at all).Now to the aromantic community. I could say that I will talk about this part of our community as much as Juno Dawson did but then this review would end here. There was not one mentioning of the possibility of being aromantic and even if there was, it was so small and seemingly unimportant that I forgot or didn't even notice it was mentioned. And then we ask ourselves why people on the aspectrum think there is something extremely wrong with them. Yeah... I wonder why...In general: Never have I been so disappointed by a book. I can't put into words how much I hated it. It's unbelievable that I wasted so much time and money on this. If you actually want to learn something about the queer community... Read a different book.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51197159-connor-whittle,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"February 7, 2018",0,0,"I would never have picked this book up if I didn't already *Somehow* own it because it comes across as and is too much of a self-help book, and honestly, I've never felt like I need help with my sexuality. As it was a short read though, I read through it in a few hours because it feels weird that as somebody who apparently knows a lot about sexuality, I've never actually read a book about it. ""This Book is Gay""--Awesome title, average writing and a lot of grazing over important things. This book suffers from, 'Lots to say, not a lot of time to say it.' Which makes a lot of the chapters, (Like the Chapter on Stereotypes) completely void of any real substance, and actually creates further homophobia by attacking LBGT members because of their attractions. This chapter seemed to think that if a gay man doesn't like femininity in a man, he is insecure. If a gay woman doesn't like the Butch Lesbian lifestyle, she is apart of the problem. It's an oversimplification to say the least. Attraction and what attracts certain people to certain people is hardly mentioned, and it really let's down this segment of the book. I also wasn't a big fan on the support, and simultaneous rejection of labels; ""Some people like labels, some don't.""--Yes, we know that. Why no discussion on why labels are inherently wrong, but for the time being, seen as necessary? The entire chapter boiled down to, ""They can be good and they can be bad."" This book would be great for kids though. It should be taught in school, probably around the ages of 11-13. The language would be a perfect fit for children and the subjects that are handled well could really help them.Coming out--A good chapter, with a lot of details and I can actually see how this chapter would help a lot of younger people. Overall it was informative, comforting and I feel it would really help younger LGBT people get over their fears. Relationships/Sex--Handled better than school. Decently written up, covered most of the basics and explained the differences between porn sex, and real intercourse. Again it made me feel like the book would be better for younger children, but I think adults would learn a little from it too. The most important message in this segment was understanding your partners needs, etc. The relationship side of things was better--Learning when you're ready to be in a relationship, and understanding the signs of a bad relationship. It deal with loneliness, desperation and how to deal with both. The history in this book was minimal but interesting. I enjoyed the little written about Alan Turing, the history on aids and gay marriage. I enjoyed the current political teaching too. (I actually learned a little I didn't previously know here) too.The stuff on bullying and religious discrimination is well-written. I think it deals with both very well. It would certainly be a help to religious LGBT persons and maybe their families. My favourite two things about this book are this though. 1. The Author has obviously put himself into every page. This isn't a dull, 'This is what being LGBT is all about!' book. It's almost like speaking to a teacher or something along those line. Hopeful and inspiring. 2. The peoples stories--this is the biggest reason I think this book should probably be taught in schools. It really helps to humanise a community who is very often seen as sub-human. The stories range from beautiful to sad. They are funny, well-written and deeply personal. If you're an out of touch parents, grandparent or guardian of an LGBT teen, read this. If you're a closeted, or, ""I have no idea what I am."" Read this. If you're a teacher trying to understand more, read this. If you're like me, an older, completely secure LGBT person--I'd give it a miss, but show it support anyway. Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10912812-christine,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"May 31, 2023",0,0,"I was so disappointed that I didn't like this book.I'm pretty staunchly opposed to book bans, so when this book was put up for banning in my area, I had to read it for myself. Even when a book is not ""for me"" a high quality book for the ""right audience"" can be a life raft, and I rankle at the thought of denying others the experience to judge for themselves. I've never read a book that shows up on ""banned book"" lists that I feel should be truly banned. Unfortunately my biggest gripe about the book is that the quality is not great. So low that I worry it might not even serve it's intended purpose for the ""right audience""By claiming to be for all, it's really for none. Is this book written for people who are coming into their queerness as adults with adult responsibilities? If yes, then including the quite lengthy portions on ""sex apps"" and adult clubs makes sense. But if this is the case, do we really need an anatomical diagram of body parts? Do we need cutesy terms like ""peen"" and ""va-jay-jay"" littered throughout? (even if it's for kids, I would appreciate more accurately named anatomical references.)If the book is for middle and high school students, why talk about the drug scene at the clubs? Why talk about sex app etiquette? I wish the author would pick an audience. On that subject, and I know this seems odd given Dawson's transition to female by the time the second edition was published, but while ""This book is gay"" purports to be for everyone, it is very heavily skewed to be read through the lens of a gay men, which is how Dawson identified at the time of first publication. There is a flow chart, for example, that asks readers to choose a gender at the top and the choices are ""male"" ""female"" and ""Unsure"" - this isn't all that inclusive. There are implications throughout that everyone is interested in having a lot of sex, and while I think it's OK to normalize that level of sexuality, the full spectrum of sexual desire is barely given lip service. Perhaps the problem is that there is simply TOO MUCH of Dawson's personal voice in this non-fiction, non-memoir book. Another way in which the book tried to reach too broad of an audience was geographically. Dawson is British, and there are references to American laws, but they seemed loose and out of date, written without a deep understanding of how broad American culture (and laws) are. I wish Dawson would have either edited out the bits relevant specifically to America, or really delved into it. I'm not sure this book gives the complete political picture a young queer American would need to be equipped with in order to feel confident navigating adulthood. There are refernces to other parts of the world that seem incomplete as well, and I wish for those parts had either been fleshed out or cut out.Lastly, there are no citations, no references, and no bibliography. Dawson's findings are based on her survey of around 300 people who identify as queer. That's not scientific. There's information about STI's in here. Outside of a memoire I just can't abide a non-fiction book without citations or references. At the end of the day, when I think about whether or not a book should be ""banned"" I ask myself: ""Would I rather my child google it instead?"" - And to that I say, this book is definitely a better resource than what you might find if you google certain key words based on it's content, but I can imagine a better book to pick up.I felt the most valuable part of the book to be the blurbs throughout- quotes from queer people who have been where readers find themselves, and sharing their experiences. I think it's really important for young queer or questioning people to feel less alone through learning about the experiences of others. The concept of the book is an important one. A queer handbook for kids should exist, I'm just not sure this one should be it.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1537857-michele,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"March 5, 2017",0,0,"As a straight person looking to be more informed and open minded, I found this book to be informative, funny and well written. This book was clearly written for a generation younger than mine, but I still found this to be a good read. However, there were a couple of places where I had some issues.1) It took until the end of the book (page 231 of 264) to mention that us straights aren't in some bitter war against LGBT folks. Those assholes that want to engage in some sort of war are slowly dying off, are getting more educated and becoming a smaller group everyday. I wish that this had been a more prominent message throughout the book.2) When talking about ""How To Make A Baby The Gay Way"" it kinda of pissed me off when the comment ""it hardly seems fair that straight people only need to neglect a condom and BOOM, they get a family"" was made. Is it easier for straight people to make babies - yes it is. It's called science. It's what nature does and I feel it was an unfair passive aggressive guilt comment that was unnecessary. And let's be fair, there are a number of straight couples that struggle everyday to create a family. I personally know a number of straight couples that have had to seek medical help to have a baby. Let's not even talk about the tens of thousands of dollars they've spent during this process. Omg, the emotional stress is a whole other topic. Adoption and using a surrogate is tough for anyone unless you're anything but an affluent, straight, white couple. Believe that.3) In a book that takes every opportunity to mention the importance of having safe sex, I find it terribly irresponsible to include Kristian's story (page 196). ""Would I go back and do things differently given the chance? Maybe."" Really? Maybe? He said that having HIV has taught him responsibility, compassion and has made him a lot less selfish. That's what your parents should teach you. You should figure a lot of that out on your own just through general life stuff and being an adult. He needed HIV to realize he was an asshole? He later goes on and gives people grief about not wanting to have sexual relationships with people that have STDs, especially HIV/AIDS. He says it's out of fear and ignorance. No, it's called taking responsibility for your health. Is HIV the death sentence it used to be? Not at all. But getting gonorrhea isn't a death sentence and I don't want that shit either. This guy reads like a self centered asshole that can only deal with how things relate to him. This book could have done without his story.Also, I've noticed in a number of people complaining about the book not fully covering the entire sexual and gender landscape/spectrum. I don't think any one book will every be able to cover everything about gender and sexuality anytime soon. I surely don't expect that from a book that was written for a YA audience like this was. Dawson never stated that this book would be a definitive, all thing gender and sexual and a manuscript for the ages. I honestly think that the hardcore dissenters of this book feel owed something by this read that was never promised to begin with. Yes, there is limited discussion of asexuality, nonbinary gender, gender fluidity, etc. but he never promises to cover all that. And to be honest, I'm glad he didn't. That's a entirely separate book for me. Most people understand, regardless of if they agree with it or not, what being LGBT means at its basic level. This book does a good job at covering those bases. But you're going to need much more space and mind share to talk fully about asexuality, people that identify with being gender fluid, etc. to really give it its due conversation and be clear and effective.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60631966-jasmin,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 1, 2017",0,0,"I would recommend this book not only to members of the LGBTQIA+ community and people who are wondering about their sexuality, but also to heterosexuals. Educate yourselves, people! Who knows you might just learn something new about yourself or others. I think that James Dawson makes some very important points in this book. Just because something goes against what society has decided is the norm does not mean it is 'wrong' or dangerous. I think it is so important for parents to be aware that everything they do and say affects their children. Accepting heterosexuality as a given is damaging to your child. Only buying gender-normative clothes or toys for your child is also severely limiting. I may not agree with everything James Dawson says; if people including your family and friends don't accept you as you are then they are not worth your time. It is not okay if they 'need time' to come to terms with you sexuality or gender. The only reason they 'need time' is because they always assumed you were the norm, which I can see no valid reason for doing. Maybe I'm just pissed at society for being small-minded and discriminating towards so many people for so many reasons, but surely we as Homo sapiens are evolved enough to make our own decisions and form our own opinions that don't necessarily to along with that of the society we live in. You are allowed to think for yourself. Society doesn't own you and neither do other people no matter how prominent they may be in society or your personal life. It astonishes, frustrates, and angers me deeply every single day how far the world and even the most 'evolved' societies have to go in terms of equality. I just can't comprehend why people choose to be ignorant and hateful. An area where I didn't feel James Dawson went enough into depth with in this book is choosing not to label yourself (yes, he says not wanting to label yourself is fine, but he does not go that much into depth with it, so just hear me out, okay?). I, personally, find labels nothing but restrictive. I don't want to label myself as anything, since I don't feel I can say with certainty that I will feel the same way my entire life. You don't fall in love with genitalia, you fall in love with a person. You are attracted to a person, so why limit yourself to a certain gender? Couldn't I just then identify as bisexual? No, because I am not bisexual. I am none of these labels. I refuse to label myself, because that will affect both the way I see myself and the way others see me. I want to be free to be attracted to whomever I find attractive without having to check a gender or sex box off first. The only thing I can say for sure is who I've been attracted to in the past and who I am attracted to now. Yes, I have only ever been attracted to one gender, so people expect me to call myself heterosexual, but why should I? Just because someone is mostly attracted to a certain gender or sex doesn't mean they are automatically attracted to everyone who is that sex or gender or that they could only ever be attracted to that one gender or sex. It's ridiculous. That being said I completely understand that some people feel the need to label themselves. I understand, and I am not judging you. Your sexuality, gender identity, and body are your business and yours only. What other people say or think doesn't matter even if it may feel like it. You are you, and you should be proud. I am proud of anyone who has the bravery to be who they truly are whether that be part of a minority or majority. The only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself.All in all I want to thank James Dawson for writing this book. I don't doubt that many people will find it immensely helpful (or educational as I have).Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109026117,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 23, 2022",0,0,"I think that this was a really cute way of introducing subjects surrounding the LGBTQ+ community. Even though I've already been out and open about my identity, I was still able to get something out of this book; I can imagine that someone new to the community would get a lot out of it. The one thing that I object to is the way that nonmonogamous folks are portrayed. In the chapter about nesting (living together, having kids, etc.), the author talks about the differences between being ""monogamous vs promiscuous"", which basically implies that all nonmonogamous people are promiscuous. While that can be the case, its not always. She does talk about open relationships, which is in fact under the umbrella of nonmonogamy, but its basically implied that people are only open because they can't suppress their urges to be with other people. I think it would be cool to have more polyamorous representation in an updated edition of the book, given how there's a good amount of LGBTQ+ folks in loving, committed relationships with multiple people. Again, polyamorous or nonmonogamous people aren't always promiscuous, and its not fair to dismiss them all as being such. One of the recurring principles of this book was how people can't be written off into stereotypes due to their sexual identity, gender, etc., which is a point that I liked a lot and feel as though it should be extended towards ENM folks too.Some other issues that I had with the book includes: the nonbinary erasure within the book. It has some points about trans folks, but barely any mention of nonbinary folks. It sort of just assumes someone is either male, female, or trans, which I don't think is really fair. (I wonder if that'll be fixed in her other book, Whats the T?). It also barely mentions asexuals. It lumps in romantic and sexual attraction into one-- while that can be the same for some folks, its not always.One last thing that I had a problem with is the fact that the book is written in a very privileged perspective. While it does talk about the ramifications of coming out and whatnot, a lot of the solutions are centered around ""your school should have resources to help!"" (what if you live in a state or country where there *isn't* resources, due to institutioal homophobia?) ""just don't go to countries where its illegal"" (what if you're from an immigrant family and have to visit the folks back home?); and I quote, ""The fear that you'll be disowned, shamed, and tossed out into the street is absolutely the worst case scenario and one that rarely happens.... The worst fear is that your family, especially your parents, might react badly. At first many do-- I won't lie-- but with time, nearly all build a bridge and get over it. If (and I can't stress enough how rare this is), the situation becomes so bad that you have to leave home, there is support out there.""This is extremely dangerous to be telling young queer folks, especially those who don't come from Western families. There are *many* cases of kids being kicked out of their home for coming out, sent to conversion camps, and in some cases, some are even maimed or killed for it. People have gone through unspeakable crimes for coming out. And unfortunately, these things happen way too often to gloss over with a ""oh your parents will most likely get over it."" That's straight up misleading and dangerous. Trans kids have some of the highest rates of homelessness, and you're gonna tell me that's a rare minority?Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6167794-wayward-child,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"September 30, 2023",0,0,"People who know me as a reader know that it’s nearly impossible for a book to make me laugh. Some of it’s down to my tendency to gravitate toward “heavy” subject matter. For the most part, it’s simply because it’s hard to make me laugh in almost any context. Sure, a book that makes me chuckle does occasionally come along, but those are few and far between. Not so with This Book Is Gay! The writing style genuinely had me laughing out loud, even howling at times. Even when I wasn’t full-on LOLing, I still wore a smile throughout these 273 pages.Speaking of the writing style, it didn’t always work for me. There were definitely times when it felt like the author was trying a bit too hard to sound like a kid. I get the intention behind the decision. After all, this book is predominantly aimed at young readers, so I understand what Dawson was going for with all the youth-y, internet lingo. Even so, at times it still felt like trying a bit too hard, like that Steve Buscemi meme.Other than that, this book is a fantastic exploration of the contemporary joys and issues a young queer person might experience. It’s uplifting, candid, and beautifully sex-positive. Honestly, reading it felt like being hugged by the most loving person on the planet. Though it’s also a bit disheartening that it has to exist in this day and age. Like I wrote in my review of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists, it’s great that works like these exist, but a part of me definitely feels discouraged by the fact there is still a need for them in the twenty-first century.I’ve spent the majority of my life in countries Dawson labelled as not the best when it comes to LGBT rights, and am thus underinformed of the struggles this community faces. So, it’s no wonder I kept muddling up certain terms or using them interchangeably, not really sure what individual concept each word represented.For example, there are so many terms that begin with ‘trans’, and I had no idea what each stood for. What is the difference between a transsexual and a transvestite? Are all these terms synonyms? Are any of them slurs? Am I allowed to use them?, etc. etc.Like many before me, I decided to educate myself.I’d also be remiss not to acknowledge that, as accepting and open-minded as I consider myself to be, I am still a cis straight woman raised in a cis straight world. As much as I hate to admit it, I recognise there are still tiny pockets of internalised homophobia and transphobia in me that I will do everything in my power to excise like the tumours they are.And that, ultimately, is why books of this ilk are so important. They hold a mirror up to our deeply ingrained biases, challenge us to be better and do better. For a queer person, especially a young one, I imagine they serve an even more vital purpose, guiding them along a path paved with love and acceptance. As I already mentioned, reading This Book Is Gay really does feel like being embraced the entire time.Also, this book features one of the best sentences I’ve ever come across in fiction and nonfiction alike. “We have to be able to talk about sexuality and identity in a non-hysterical way.” Words for our time.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106520560-selina,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"December 28, 2023",0,0,"This book had the chance to be a great introduction to sexuality and gender for teens or anyone who just started questioning their identity. Instead it’s a mess of a book that I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy.First of all, this book is incredibly outdated. Sure, it’s from 2014 so that is to be expected. However, I did not expect the casual use of slurs (d slur, t slur, you name it), or the opinionated and close-minded views this book has. Some of the discussions Juno Dawson starts could have genuinely been interesting if she spent more than a page on them. For example she starts a conversation about monogamy vs. promiscuity (which btw is not the opposite of monogamy but let’s ignore that for now). This is a topic that people have written entire books about yet her main argument boils down to: monogamous relationships will give you stability but you will feel like you’re missing out whereas “promiscuity” will grant you freedom for the small price of herpes and having to sit at the freak table at weddings (yes I am directly quoting her…she actually said that. Check page 207). This book is mostly directed at cis gay men. Sure, there’s some mentions of lesbians here and there but we don’t really go beyond that. With the constant talk of men and women it is also very much focused on the binary. If you think she is going to have anything thing to say about non binary, agender or genderfluid identities, you have the wrong book. Gender is only really mentioned in terms of transgender people and what she has to say about that topic isn’t all that great either. Surprising, considering the author is trans herself, but oh well seems like she still has to work through some things. Most identities are merely brushed over in the intro chapter. Intersex people get half a page that basically says “hey they’re not trans”. Bisexuality gets pretty much disregarded by her constantly differentiating between gay and straight only. Asexuality is something that she introduces very briefly just to then mention that it is often used as a stepping stone by teenagers while they figure themselves out. An idea that is reinforced by her later screaming at us in all caps that “there is one universal truth of the universe: WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE” (p.210). Yikes.And that is also a quote that pretty much sums up the majority of the content of this book. Because when talking about sexuality, Juno Dawson really means: sex. Specifically sex between cis men. I absolutely understand why this is part of the book and I do like her emphasis on safe sex. However not every queer person is thinking about sex 24/7 like this book wants to make you believe. We get tips where to meet hook-ups, what lube to buy and some pseudo facts I would love to know the source of (I don’t actually believe that it’s been statistically proven that gay men are hornier than straight men or that there are any other biological facts that are directly related to a person’s sexuality). There’s also a whole lot of talk of HIV which yeah…I don’t really want to get into.This book tries awfully hard to be funny and quirky and stays very much on the surface of things. You can tell it was published in 2014 by its tumblresque quality (larry stylinson and the word cakealicious make an appearance) but none of that can cover the fact that it is horribly researched, outdated and more offensive than helpful.Show more"

Stand auf meiner Ausgabe nicht James Dawson? Doch nach kurzer Recherche stellte ich fest, ok, die Autorin hat sich in der Zwischenzeit als Transgender geoutet. Und auch aus dem Grunde war es mir ein Anliegen, über das Buch zu schreiben; denn ich war bestimmt nicht die erste, der das passiert ist, und bestimmt gab es da auch Reaktionen, die nachhaltigere Irritation beinhalteten. Und genau darüber klärt das Buch auf.Ich habe es 2016 in einem kleinen Buchladen in der Dubliner Innenstadt gekauft, habe also nur die englische Ausgabe hier, aber ich denke, was folgt, trifft auch genauso auf die deutsche Version zu. Ich habe das Buch gekauft, als ich selbst noch damit beschäftigt war, mich selbst und meine Identität zu finden. Ich war zwar ganz gut über die LGBT*-Welt informiert, aber ich wollte mehr wissen. Und außerdem habe ich alles gekauft, wo ein Regenbogen drauf war.Trotzdem war ich vermutlich schon etwas zu alt und ""drin"", um aus How to be Gay noch wirklich etwas neues rausholen zu können. Trotzdem hat es mich, besonders für ein Sachbuch, sehr gut unterhalten. Damals hatte ich immer mal wieder längere S-Bahnfahrten zu bewältigen; und dafür war es genau das richtige, da man auch praktisch überall Absätze machen kann. Das einzige Problem war nur die Angst, dass mich jemand Falsches mit dem Buch in der Hand sehen könnte, was aber zum Glück nie passiert ist. Achja, das zeigt doch gerade, wie sehr man solche Aufklärung noch braucht.Jedenfalls ist das Buch wirklich süß aufgemacht, mit schönen Illustrationen, sodass es eben nicht wie ein langweiliges Sachbuch wirkt, sondern auch Spaß beim Lesen macht, und hoffentlich auch jüngere Menschen erreicht, die vielleicht noch Unterstützung dabei brauchen, herauszufinden, wer sie sind. Und: es nimmt weder ein Blatt vor den Mund, noch wirkt es in irgendeiner Weise vulgär. Dinge werden bei ihrem Namen genannt, und wenn sie doch umschrieben werden, dann mit schönen Begriffen.Was das Buch besonders realitätsnah macht, sind die vielen Erfahrungsberichte von Lesben, Schwulen, Bisexuellen, Transmenschen, und sich anders definierenden Menschen. Sie erzählen von Angst, Leid, aber vor allem auch Freude und der Appreciation (wofür mir kein passendes deutsches Wort einfällt) der eigenen Vielfalt.Das Buch verbreitet die Aussage: Jede*r ist richtig so wie er*sie ist, und es ist ok, sich selbst nicht 100% einordnen zu können; denn man ist so viel mehr als der Begriff, mit dem man sich versucht eine Identität zu geben. Jeder Mensch ist ein facettenreiches Individuum.Damit ist das Buch genau das richtige für alle, die wissen wollen, wer sie sind; vor allem die jüngeren Mitglieder der LGBT*-Community. Aber auch für alle anderen, wir wollen uns doch gegenseitig verstehen, oder? Also, Unbeteiligte, Freund, Eltern, Lehrer, lest dieses Buch!Am Ende des Buches (zumindest der englischen Ausgabe) sind einige Adressen, Telefonnummern, und Anlaufstellen zusammengefasst.https://wolkenwetter-und-leselust.blo...Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12129581-mitchell,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"February 26, 2019",0,0,"I don't think I'm going to have any particularly new ideas to share about this book, but I can say that I agree with the predominant opinions that this book is dated in its cissexism, ableism, and general demeanor. In a phrase, it's useful but not good.Some other people have had way better thoughts coming from their own perspective, so I thought I'd highlight a few reviews that have already noticed some of the concerns that I did, especially if their identity was collateral damage in the book:Izzy's review hits on a lot of the missed topics, including limited definitions of genders and orientations, the lack of racial nuance, and the absence of safe sex for women partners. (But it's a great 13-item list and I'm just being the hype man here, so go read it.)Dahlia Adler's review is both concise and scathing, which is beautiful, but also notes that the discussion of religion is really problematic as it pertains to Jewish folks. Jennifer's review points out that intersectionality does not get the attention it deserves, and other problematic elements.Dylan's review notes the ableism and the cissexism, and the limited perspective. Within the first few pages, I knew I would have my doubts about this book. Not only is the trans language outdated, but the book's guidance is compared to Rafiki in The Lion King—an iconic character who falls into the ""magical negro"" trope. I don't quite know what else to say except I felt that Black kids probably weren't going to find a home in this book. (For what it is worth, I scanned to see if there were any Black reviewers of this book going off of their profile pic, and didn't find any for sure in English.)Other problematic quotes that I bothered to write down:""[Discussing the t-slur, and you should not use it.] This is because a lot of trans people find it offensive, so why would you want to go around upsetting people? Are you a sociopath? No, so don't do it"" (30). (An example of ableism.)""The myth of the 'angry lesbian,' the idea that all gay women are militants who seek to kill and scalp men"" (63). (While this is meant to be supporting gay women, the use of the word ""scalp"" has negative connotations that tend to recall Native Americans.)""...prostitution (which isn't a brilliant career option, let's be honest)..."" (108). (I'm the last person to know how sex work should fit into a book for teens, but when this is the ONLY MENTION and it's demonized across the board, there should be something else.""Self-hugging is only for people in straightjackets"" (138). (More ableism!)So, there was a lot of outdated information, some really unfortunate stereotypes and cissexism, and to top it all off,

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11622208-rakkasei,This Book Is Gay,Rating 4 out of 5,"September 13, 2020",0,0,"Besonders gut hat mir der Aufbau des Buches gefallen, denn es wird mit vielen Vorurteilen aufgeräumt und man erfährt einiges über die aktuelle Situation vieler LGBT weltweit. Hauptsächlich geht es jedoch um LGBT in Großbritannien, wobei die Adresslisten am Ende des Buches an Deutschland angepasst wurden.Vieles war mir im Vorfeld schon bekannt, da ich schon einige Sachbücher in die Richtung gelesen habe und somit habe ich jetzt nicht viel neues erfahren. Was ich jedoch wirklich schön finde an dem Buch ist, dass hier eben nichts geschönt wird und einige wirklich wichtige Themen wie STD/STI angesprochen werden. Und auch sonst kommen Themen vor, denen ich bisher in solchen Sachbüchern noch nicht begegnet bin und die Erklärungen sind durchgehend einfach und verständlich gehalten. Gegen Ende des Buches gibt es zudem ein Kapitel welches sich an Eltern wendet.Die kleinen Illustrationen lockern das alles ein wenig auf und sind teilweise sehr witzig. Zudem kommen immer wieder verschiedene Menschen aus der LGBT-Szene zu Wort und oft liest es sich so, als würde die Autorin einem selbst das erklären. Natürlich spiegeln diese Aussagen nur einen Bruchteil der Erfahrung derjenigen wieder und das wird auch immer wieder erwähnt. Nur weil man selbst noch nicht mit Diskriminierung und Anfeindungen konfrontiert wurde heißt es nicht, dass sie nicht existiert. Nicht umsonst ist das Thema outen so ein riesiges Thema, welches angesprochen wurde. Heterosexualität ist nun einmal die Norm und leider gibt es genug Menschen, die nichts anderes akzeptieren.Es ist vieles wirklich sehr umgangssprachlich gehalten, was wirklich gut zum Thema passt. Schließlich gibt es nichts schlimmeres als Oberlehrerhafte Aufklärungsbücher mit kuriosen Bildern/Fotos. Auf diese wird hier verzichtet, was ich aber ganz okay finde. Schließlich weiß man ja was gemeint ist und so ein geschriebener Text ist ohnehin meist aussagekräftiger als eine schlechte Illustration/Grafik. Man bekommt einen relativ guten Einblick über die verschiedenen sexuellen Orientierungen und Identitäten, weshalb sich das Sachbuch auch wunderbar als Einstiegslektüre eignet. Wobei das Hauptaugenmerk hier eindeutig auf Lesben, Schwulen und Transsexuellen liegt. Für ein ultimatives Sachbuch über Sex und Identität fehlt mir einfach das Wissen zu all jenen Orientierungen, die hier nur als eine Art Randerscheinung dienen. Und wenn man es ganz genau nimmt geht es hauptsächlich nur um schwule cis-Männer, was für ein so inklusives Buch einfach nur traurig ist. Wer also mehr über alles jenseits von LGBT wissen möchte wird hier wahrscheinlich nicht fündig.Fazit:Gerade für Neugierige und diejenigen ohne viel Vorwissen eignet sich dieses Buch. Man bekommt wirklich viel Wissen vermittelt. Natürlich ersetzt es kein Gespräch mit LGBT-Leuten, jedoch verschafft es fürs erste einen guten Einblick. So wirklich inklusiv ist das Buch jetzt nicht, aber im Titel steht ja auch ""gay"" und darum geht es ungeachtet des Klappentextes hauptsächlich. Show more"

I am not a teen anymore and I know who I am, but I imagine this book would be a life raft for anyone out there who is questioning their gender or sexual identity or orientation. It explains the labels and what they mean. It allows for uncertainty and offers some ways to think things through so a reader can clarify their feelings about who they are. It is open and matter-of-fact and safe. There is acceptance and joy and no shaming.I bought this book in part because I was on vacation somewhere else and had the conscious thought that this book, with this title needed to come into the state of Florida at this point in time. But I also got it because I was interested. The book reads as though reader and author are having a frank conversation and the reader has asked the author questions and the author just opens up and explains everything and makes it clear. I loved the clarity and informality. It took a subject that feels weighty with decades of shame and secrecy and brought it out in the open and dusted it off and showed that it's not so complex or scary after all. The author tackles the definitions and differences and gender identity and sexual attraction in a way that makes them easy to understand and everyday rather than exotic.A completely new idea for me was the author's point that sex education in schools is and has been heteronormative and homophobic. I had never thought about it before, but I completely agree. All of the information in this book could and should be taught as part of health and sexual education from the earliest ages onward. We won't create more LGBTQ+ people, but we might make the world a safer place for the LGBTQ+ people we have among us. Imagine.I really loved the chapter on various ways of sexual interaction and how to have sex, have sex safely and how to talk about it. How refreshing to normalize sex and sexual activity to make it more talkable and less scary and less fraught. If it's less fraught, then it's easier to have conversations about likes and dislikes, health and safety, and to give consent. These conversations become normal and not scary/impossible to imagine having. And then people are making wiser, more informed decisions about what they wish to do with their bodies, rather than caving to peer (or partner) pressure, or to their idea of what ""everyone else"" is doing. In my experience a person who is afraid of something will unconsciously act in such a way as to make it more likely to happen. In our culture's collective fear of talking about sex and sexuality to our younger members...or even to our own sexual partners, we make STIs, rape and unplanned pregnancy more likely to happen. This book shows how easy the conversation and information sharing can be. And it broke my heart a little to be reading it in Don't-Say-Gay Florida in 2022. But, onward.Side note - the information in this book is useful and appropriate for all young adults whether LGBTQ+ or straight. Show more"

I appreciate what the author was trying to do, giving a kind of sex ed for queer/questioning teens is a very good idea, I personally definitely didn’t receive any queer sex ed in school and I believe it should be mandatory just like heterosexual sex educationbut here are some of my issues listed in no particular order - there were spelling and grammatical errors in this book which always makes books seem hastily written and edited and unprofessional- many things in this book are oversimplified, you can’t draw a straight line from from a to b when it comes to sexual orientations imo and many “helpful” advice was simply not true and accurate. Eg. we live in a very heteronormative society that trains us from early on to think relationships and sex is heterosexual, so it’s not as simple as to say when you think about a man and a woman having sex you’re straight and when you think about two women you’re a lesbian, because even I - a sapphic woman - grew up with such a straight idea of sex but it didn’t at all mean I’m straight - the author uses a language that is supposed to be ✨relatable✨ but often comes across as inauthentic and wanna be hip and cool, too many uses of modern day teen slang will make books lose their relevance and fade more quickly which for a nonfiction book about a subject that will concern many teens for the next years is a shame, the book is 6 years old and already many of the slang used is outdated and from my own teen years- often I felt like the author didn’t take the subject very seriously, there is a difference between adding humour and wit to your “dry” nonfiction book yet in this case sarcasm and other undermining rhetoric was simply overused and it made it seem like the topic wasn’t serious- one thing that made me bump my rating down to one star was how the author was honestly factually wrong and misinforming the audience- on numerous accounts did the author equate gender to sex, eg. “man has a penis” “lesbians like vaginas” no, not all men have a penis, and lesbians like women and that includes trans women who may not have a vagina - very annoyed by the wrong definition of bisexuality (bisexual people are attracted to all genders, not just the binary two) - “Universal truth: we all want to have sex with loads of people” in a book about lgbt* people forgetting about asexuals seems careless at best and offensive at worst - I’m honestly shocked I have to explain all this to a queer author who I would assume is more knowledgeable on queer theory than the average human but apparently I’m wrong These were the things that bothered me a lot while reading, there were a few other moments that made me shake my head. Overall I’d say this book can benefit cis gay teen boys who are very new to figuring out their sexuality but sadly everyone else will leave this book just more confused.Show more"

Durch dieses Buch möchte er zeigen, dass all das gar nicht so kompliziert ist, wie es ausschaut…Ich habe dieses Buch noch in der Ausführung, wo die Autorin noch im falschen Körper steckte. Ich weiß nicht, ob sich das Buch dann sehr unterscheidet, aber ich denke nicht. Außerdem möchte ich auch nicht den Dead Namen nennen, denn dazu habe ich überhaupt keine Berechtigung. Von daher werde ich in dieser Rezension die Autorin Juno Dawson nennen, dass dient nur zur Orientierung. Trotz allem ist dieses Buch eine dicke Empfehlung, denn jeder kann etwas daraus mitnehmen!Bei diesem Buch hat die Autorin eine Menge Arbeit reingesteckt. Das merkt man daran, dass sie bereits einige Erfahrungen gemacht hat und diese hier mit eingearbeitet hat, aber auch, dass andere Menschen zu Wort kommen und die Möglichkeit von ihrem Leben und ihren Erfahrungen zu erzählen. Und alleine das ist für mich ein sehr großer Pluspunkt, denn dadurch wird das Geschriebene noch einmal unterstrichen und bei Bedarf noch näher erläutert.In diesem Buch gibt es so viele sexuellen Orientierungen, Entwicklungen, Meinungen und Religionen rund um das Thema LBGTQIA+. Auf wenn man sich für einen bereits sehr aufgeklärten Mensch hält, so wie ich das bei mir dachte, bekommt man dennoch immer wieder neue Informationen aus der Commuinty und klärt uns Menschen noch weiter auf. Ich bin wirklich sehr überrascht über dieses kleine Büchlein und bin Juno Dawson total dankbar dafür, dass sie dieses Buch geschaffen hat.Der Schreibstil von Juno Dawson war für mich neu, da ich bis dahin noch gar kein Buch von ihr gelesen hatte. Trotz allem konnte sie mich mit diesem Buch komplett von ihrer Schreibweise überzeugen. Sie schreibt locker, leicht und total flüssig, weshalb man sehr gut durch den Inhalt kommt. Außerdem finde ich es richtig toll, dass sie ein bisschen Humor und Sarkasmus mit eingebaut hat. Das sorgt dafür, dass das Buch nicht so stumpf ist, sondern auch ein bisschen Witz beinhält.,,How to Be Gay‘‘ ist ein sehr wichtiges Buch, was sich jeder Mal zu Herzen nehmen sollte. Auch wenn ausschließlich in dem Buch von der LGBTQIA+ Commuinty die Rede ist, kann sich wirklich jeder etwas aus dem Buch mitnehmen.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121865185-zuzu-boomer-knapp,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"March 25, 2023",0,0,"*This review is based on the 2020 releaseA validating and optimistic - if simplified and outdated – primer on the queer community that focuses almost exclusively on cis gay men in the UK. Covers an almost too broad range of topics from defining identities, coming out, sex, dating, bullying, religion, and more without much specificity. Definitely shows its age in the language, humor, and statistics, but Dawson comes off genuine in her enthusiasm and pride for the community. This Book is Gay is an adequate beginner’s guide to an older generation of the queer community that still holds some truth and merit, but is lacking in intersectionality for sure. Recommend to older queer and questioning teens with a grain of salt. Not a bad start, but you’re better off with some newer material (The Pride Guide, The Quick & Easy Guide to Queer & Trans Identities, A Queer History of the United States for Young People).Pros:-Validating for younger queer people just starting to understand their identity-Quick-and-dirty summary touching on a broad range of topics all in one book-Fast read-Affirming and educational for younger queer kids who may not have been exposed to much/any queer content-Frank explanations of queer sex-Emphasis on safe sex practices with several notes on risks of certain behaviors-Anecdotes from older queer folk who have lived and learned through several experiences that are still relevant to queer teens today. I think It’s always affirming to hear from older queer people (except for that story about the 16 year old British guy who hooked up with an older, married man, oh my GOD, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS??)Interesting, if brief, insight into queer historyCons:-Gay, Cis Male-centered. A lot of the content catered exclusively to this community. Not necessarily bad, but also not necessarily comprehensive.-Uk-centered. America doesn’t have the same legislative protections for queer folk as the UK, which could lead to an inflated sense of security in younger queer kids. ALSO, I was definitely thrown off by some of the more crude UK slang.-I am no scientist, but some stats definitely seemed out-dated and off? Seems like rates of depression/suicide as well as number of youth coming out are higher now?? (Correct me if I’m wrong)-Over-the-top in its assumption of EVERY queer person wanting A LOT of sex ALL THE TIME. Doesn’t compensate for personal preference and leans into the stereotype of queer relationships being ALL about queer sex. Would have appreciated more emphasis on the romantic aspect of queer dating.-Unfortunate 2013 Tumblr humor/language (“le sigh” omg I had a war flashback when I read that)-IMO speaks on an older generation of the queer community that is not as interchangeable with young queer teens todayShow more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5066657-becky,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"March 29, 2023",0,0,"(Review of the first edition for reasons explained later on)I'm not *quite* the target demographic for this--there is a tiny little chapter at the end for parents, but that's it--and though I found it a quick and engrossing read, even I could see that it's not the most balanced book out there. If you're a young cis gay person, there's a decent amount of info for you. Lesbians and bi folks don't get as much page time, but an effort was made. Trans issues are...covered, to an extent. But right off the bat (literally on page 2 in my copy) the author says Sometimes a man might want to be a woman.Sometimes and woman might want to be a man. which again, I won't even pretend to be an expert or even terribly knowledgeable about this topic, but--that's not how it works? WTF?And I get why they went with using LGBT* here for their label in the actual text, but to give asexuals three whole paragraphs and then nothing else for 262 pages--especially when one of those pages contains the ""universal truth"" line (bold and in all caps), ""we all want to have sex with loads of people..."" (Apparently one of the revisions in the second edition is to add ""(unless you're asexual, obvs.)"" to that--thank you, Amazon's ""look inside"" feature--but still.) ""Loads of people?"" Um, no. (Pansexuals and non-binary/gender nonconforming /genderqueer also get very limited page time. Of course less than 300 pages isn't going to be super inclusive, but come on...)The author's seeming irreverence--I know, they're trying to connect with THE KIDS, which I am not--was a bit cringy at times. I feel if you have to put so many ""kidding!""s into your manuscript maybe you shouldn't do so much...kidding? Hopefully the author had a lot more input from readers of all types and backgrounds before sending the second edition out into the world, to not only shift some of the imbalances but also to add in a lot more sensitivity.What I did like: Strong emphasis on safe sex and condoms (though again, only a cursory mention about how to be safe if no one involved actually has condom-wearing equipment. Blink and you'll miss it). Arguments for normalizing comprehensive sex education. The bits (sometimes a paragraph or two, sometimes a few pages) taken from interviews with actual people--honestly, I think those were the best parts of the book. Our library system has FIVE copies of the 2015 version, and only ONE of the 2021 one--not realizing the difference, I ended up ordering one of the original copies...which of course desperately needs updating. So my rating is strictly based on the version I read with the sincere hope that most of the much needed updates were made on the second edition. There's 40ish more pages, so fingers crossed?Rating: 3+ stars / BPrint copy borrowed from the library.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139725389-jack-potter,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"October 22, 2023",1 like,0,"As someone who is currently in the process of coming out I was curious about this book and the controversy around it. I went to my local library and picked it up. Having read it I am shocked that anyone would think this is a suitable book for children.“Frankly, if you want to identify as a carrot, I will march in the Carrot Pride parade with you.” this is a quote from the author and clearly gives you an idea of what this book will contain.This book is absolutely disgusting, how it makes it way into libraries (especially in the children's section) is horrifying. This books states that people used to be 'super open-minded about gay shiz' is an absolute lie (there was a law in ancient Rome about being able to get gay men (or suspected gay men to move if they sat next to you), and then goes on to blame Christianity for all homophobia. The book takes a few attacks on Christians for being homophobic, I hope that the author has looked into the treatment of gay in some middle Eastern countries. The book also makes the claim that gender transitions (remember sex cannot be changed, it is genetics) are not instantly given to children, again the author ignores whistle blowers from quite a few gender clinics all coming out saying how quickly children were given hormones and rushed into surgeries. Another part of the book bemoans the fact that straight sex is taught to 11 year olds while gay sex is not taught. At least with this point the author does admit that only 5% of the population is gay. Trying to cater for such a minority at all times is not practical. Straight sex education is taught because it is much they are the majority and essential for the continuation of the species.The books goes onto to describe boy on boy sex, which I have such an issue with. Boy sex such not be such a thing, boys are children and children should have nothing to do with sex. While it is important for people to understand sex, they should get instructions from a book that is written as though it is for children. Having read through this book, it becomes effectively a sex manual for children. The sheer fact that the book mentions bath houses is an instant red flag for me, it does continue by discussing sex apps, open relationships, glory holes, scat, water sports/ golden showers.In another section of the book, the author attacks monogamy by saying that it is outdated. This completely flies in the face of so many facts and statistics about the absurdly high level of child abuse in open relationships. They are not safe for children and this book should not be encouraging it. I will balance this with if the individuals have no intention of having children, I have no issue with someone deciding to have an open relationship. Show more"

Being this a self-help book/guide for queer people (mostly the LGB part of the community), I found myself skipping some chapters or simply skimming them because they were about topics i had already figured out (identity and labels) or about topics i have no interest in atm (eg having kids). I will give this book 3 stars only because of the Italian translation (which is the edition i've read in paperback), as at times it used somewhat derogatory terms for trans people, and more generally it often overtranslated terms as ""coming out of the closet"" or ""bear"" (as in hairy gay man) for no reason apparent reason. I would brush it off on the fact that this edition dates back quite a few years and sensibility about topics such as the lgbtq community has been growing in Italy since then (albeit at a slow pace); however it doesnt sit right with me and it's pretty obvious the translator was out of his depth when working on this book because he even overtranslated ""My Little Pony"" (the kids show) as ""Mio mini pony"" despite the italian version keeping the original english title. -----------Il libro in sé è ben scritto, spesso porta anche un velo di comicità per alleggerire temi altrimenti pesanti o più tristi, e in generale svolge il suo lavoro abbastanza bene. Essendo questo un libro self-help in veste di guida per la gente queer (principalmente la parte LGB della comunità), mi sono ritrovatə a saltare alcuni capitoli o semplicemente a leggerli distrattamente perché riguardavano cose che avevo già capito per conto mio anni fa (ex. identità ed etichette) o argomenti in cui non ho alcun interesse al momento (ex. le diverse opzioni per avere figli).Darò a questo libro 3 stelle solo a causa della traduzione italiana poiché a volte usa termini un piuttosto dispregiativi nei confronti delle persone trans, e più in generale spesso traduce innecessariamente termini come ""coming out of the closet"" o ""bear"" (termine che in inglese si rifà a uomini gay e pelosi) senza una ragione apparente. Vorrei giustificare tutto ciò col fatto che quest'edizione risale a un po' di anni fa e la sensibilità su temi come la comunità lgbtq è cresciuta nel nostro paese da allora (anche se a ritmi ben troppo lenti); tuttavia non lo ritengo accettabile per un libro che si vuole guida deə giovani queer ed è abbastanza ovvio che il traduttore non fosse nelle sue acque traducendo questo libro perché ha persino tradotto ""My Little Pony"" (lo spettacolo per bambini) come ""Mio mini pony"".

Telling people they get to choose their identities made it feel like the author was implying sexuality was a choice and the lifestyle is a choice- despite repetitively saying preference isn't a choice.The age it is aimed for is YA which is 12-18. The author also claims it's not for children on her Instagram. Yet the tone in much of the book is geered toward the 8-15 mentality. (Reminded me very much of the YouTubers who aim their content for young kids /pre teens. You know, the ones that like to shout random ""funny"" things)I found this strange, especially with his (at the point the book was written, Juno Dawson said she was a gay man, so going off that) private thought comments throughout the book. Going from his crush on Dean Cain to being exicited about the claim that gay men typically have thicker longer penises. With the age group being 12-18, the section on sex apps and how to use them seems inappropriate, despite the disclaimer that you have to be 18+ to use them. The section gives advice on how to meet up for sex, and does not suggest meeting that person with friends first which is straight up dangerous and one of the first ""rules"" for online dating. Followed by the warning that if you're on sexaps and under 18 swapping naked pictures is illegal... Again, under 18 is the demographic people believe this book is aimed for and is targeted. It lacked safety measures and felt straight up dangerous and reckless. There also seems to be the misconception that sex ed in school is meant to teach children how to pleasure themselves and each other, instead of the basics of how babies are created and safety/health. The section on having sex /pleasuring your partner is above the age group the first half of the book established itself for. Yes, useful knowledge, but for older teens /adults. The content about stds and handling them, I felt was important. Including ""scat: poop eating"" felt homophobic. I think if this book had toned back the, ""I'm your quirky gay friend!"" and was marketed for 16+ it would be more accepted (aside from the outdated material now). The problem is the book market doesn't have a term for this yet. So it got lumped with YA, and people having not read the content feel it's appropriate for that entire demographic. 2 stars for not only bring outdated, but because the author's YouTuber tone was obnoxious to read after awhile.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80421844-emma-katherine,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"June 8, 2021",0,0,"This review contains my personal opinions!I don’t have much to say about “This Book Is Gay” except that I am very disappointed with it. I expected more after hearing such praise and learning that, like me, Juno Dawson is a trans author! However, the book strayed from topic to topic (not all of which pertained to the LGBTQ+ community) and included anecdotes from LGBTQIA+ teens that painfully hit the extremes: the stories either had nothing to do with the chapter or they were blatantly written to fit the section’s theme. Nothing felt natural, except the flow, which was so natural that it was difficult to follow. In my speculatory opinion, Dawson wrote the entire book without any plan or editing in order to “relate to teenagers” as if they learn from chaos instead of structure. It was difficult to stay engaged due to the casual writing style, but I also found the content offensive and irrelevant for the targeted audience. ""This is that instruction manual"" and ""this book is for everyone"" are not the phrases I would use to describe “This Book is Gay” - in fact, I believe a better title would be “This Book is Mildly Offensive But Gets Away With It Because The Author Directly Addresses The Jokes By Saying ‘LOL Just Kidding’”. As a trans and queer reader who has experienced HBT bullying, I sincerely hope uneducated cisgender/heterosexual readers don’t pick this book up and learn that, as one example among others, cutting down the LGBTQIA+ acronym to LGBT out of convenience is acceptable. If there is one place to learn about the LGBTQIA+ community, feel safe to discuss questioning your sexual and gender identity, and feel accepted by the author, shouldn’t it be this book? I'm aware shortening the LGBTQIA+ abbreviation might feel like a small example of writing a half-hearted book, but remember that adding QIA+ would take less than five seconds and would mean the world to thousands, if not millions of readers. Considering this is the book for LGBTQIA+ readers, it was a sorry attempt at supporting the community and teaching readers how to treat others not based on sexual and gender identity. I sincerely hope you learned from and enjoyed this book, but if you’re considering reading it now, I would recommend you choose another LGBTQIA+ novel that draws a clear line between insulting and teasing.Note: I am a member of and ally of the LGBTQIA+ community. This review is based off of the book's style and tone, not what it supports.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1490224-jennifer,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"August 22, 2017",0,0,"While this book could fill an important gap on bookshelves, it is unfortunately too strongly from the POV of a white, cis, Christian (at least culturally) gay man, though to be clear, that is not the complete and complex identity of the author. If Dawson limited themself* to writing simply to that audience, I would absolutely applaud it. But they write about, and dismiss/erase, other groups even when they are trying to support them (for example, they attempt to critique gendering fashion when defining the term ""lipstick lesbian,"" which has the effect of seeming to diminish the term itself). And this book *absolutely* attempts to address the whole rainbow, let me acknowledge and appreciate that; it just, simply, fails. Christianity gets a nuanced treatment that no other religion does; intersectionality is mentioned in passing, but not understood; asexuality seems not to even exist; lesbians and bisexuals given a small fraction of the word count, which perpetuates the idea that they are only a small fraction of the LGBTQIA community and keeps gay men front and center; and trans* issues, as other reviews have mentioned, are just stomped all over, as Dawson repeatedly jokes that being gay is a matter of being attracted to penises. However, the goal of this book - an explicit, funny, uncomfortable-to-many-adults discussion of what it means to be a member of the LGBTQIA community, to question and discover your sexuality, to come out, to fall in love, to have a mature sex life, to have an *immature* opportunity to giggle at and revel in being a sexual creature the way hetero people do (see: a million ""that's what she said"" jokes by straight people everywhere) - I applaud that and I want to see more of that. Just...not quite this way. A for effort, please try this again with a more inclusive heuristic or even with an acknowledgment that the book is directed solely towards one segment of the LGBTQIA community, so that the others aren't harmed through inadequate representation.*I use gender-neutral pronouns in this review, although Dawson is a woman, because she wrote this book with a male point of view and I feel that it did negatively affect the book. I need a way to represent the non-female point of view *within this book.* Dawson is a woman and is properly addressed with female pronouns.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149205990-lucy-she-her,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"July 13, 2024",0,0,"* I read the revised version of this book, by Juno Dawson *this book wasn’t great. “what’s the t?” is way better, but still not fantastic. i feel like juno’s non-fiction books are always somewhat lacking. here are my notes:- if this is the revised version, i can’t imagine what the version before it would’ve looked like. i get that this may be really really simplified for people with no clue but it comes across incorrect, offensive, and belittling - the cartoons are really ugly - “both sexes” - “either men or women” - implication that asexuality is often a stepping stone? and that they’re all sex repulsed?- “don’t ever use it or he/she” okay, obviously not as insults or whole words (e.g. “heshe”) but as pronouns some people use he/she or it/its - i feel like this information is either outdated or just badly explained - the “identify as a carrot” ‘joke’ reminds me of the attack helicopter stuff, and is completely stupid because it implies that we accept people’s identities because they tell us to and not because they’re science-backed and logical… i don’t know, it just feels kind of insulting to act like you’re just humouring someone by respecting their identity, or like you’re just playing along. non-binary people are real. - “one gender more than the other”- poor editing - referred to herself as a gay man in the book, using “we” when talking about gay men - misandry isn’t real, full stop- “swapping gender” isn’t what being trans is- it’s nice to call queer people strong but it kind of glorifies facing adversity - the advice on bullying is good- i appreciate the stats about queer girls’ depression vs queer boys’, but how about vs straight girls / boys?? i feel like that’s the necessary comparison here- “mankind and also womankind”. okay. to be honest, it feels like juno’s head is switched to the baseline knowledge that there are only 2 genders, until she reminds herself there are others. this shouldn’t be how your brain functions. it should be common sense to you, a simple fact, that non-binary people exist. they are just as real as men and women. - weird attitudes to sex workers - juno being oddly offended that “gay” was historically used to refer to prostitutes - surely that’s more offensive to prostitutes because their name is being used as an insult? like when people say “that’s gay”, it’s offensive to gay people, but not offensive to the person, as being gay isn’t an insult - “gender dysmorphia” - it’s dysphoria - i understand that a third gender is an old cultural concept but don’t relate it to our understanding of non-binary people as if they’re a singular third gender - some of this shit needs updating. it’s no longer unusual to have a boyfriend age 10. i had one age 10 and was one of the last people in my entire school to do so. most people are now dating from 5/6 onwards. ditto coming out - i’d say it’s now done closer to 12/13 than 17. - “original gender”- using the phrase “mega political sadface” when you’re discussing queer people being killed seems a bit inappropriate - “do you live in … one of the eighty ish countries where you might be … stoned to death? look into getting a passport. joking aside,” how is this a joke?! am i missing something? i thought it was genuine good advice. unless it’s saying you shouldn’t come out at all, passport or no. either way, is it appropriate to joke about…?- there’s lots of focus on how making eye contact signals to others that you’re gay/you want to pull, which hurts (no pun intended)as i find it physically painful to make eye contact - plus it’s yet another social rule i’d never heard of before. but we move - i do NOT like the idea that being rejected is “their problem not yours”… it’s nobody’s problem that they don’t find you attractive. as a woman, this pov scares me- again, making jokes out of overdosing (“you’re worth more than that *shampoo ad hair flick*”). you can make serious, necessary points without making them into unfunny jokes - where is the mention of consent? not even one? jfc- “guy/girl” “him/her” JESUS FUCKING CHRIST YOURE TRANSGENDER. SAY ‘PERSON’ AND ‘THEM’ - telling “men” to use a condom isn’t keeping trans men in mind - just say people with penises- “guys and girls” bro. bro. bro. - i think the “sex app” section was poorly compiled, or at least poorly explained to those who contributed. there must be a difference between sex apps and dating apps. you asked people what they thought and they said the downside of sex apps was… they were just used for sex. which you’d think was the point of them. so i don’t think you made it clear you meant sex apps, not just dating apps … and then you go on to ridicule the idea of looking for dates on these apps? right after including quotes from people looking for dates? jfc - using fat as an insult - “twitchy-eyed freakazoid” INCREDIBLY ableist, my fucking god HOW did this get past publishers - “always wear a condom”. sigh. the book is for gay cis men. - minor typos - lazy editing- the table of date ideas is cool - “if your partner starts working out exactly what each person owes, dump them at once”. i have absolutely no idea if this is a joke or not, and no way of finding out. however, it’s shitty advice and bewildering too. most people can’t afford to pay for two meals, or if they ordered something cheaper, it’s not fair to pay the same. - “changing their gender”- you included a story about a sixteen year old child having sex with an older and married man in a section about sexual experiences? how is this appropriate to share? - virginity. isn’t. real.- “sex should always start with a kiss” hello?? why?? who made you the fucking authority - someone who was quoted used “transwomen”, all one word. i despair “HIM OR HER”. AGAIN.- i’d argue that sleeping around is being seen as an empowered decision now, not a shamed one - juno said things are changing in the other direction and that people are moving against it - and it’s seen as tacky? for those who don’t want relationships, it’s just what you do.- the idea that you shouldn’t cheat because you might get an STI?? bro just DON’T CHEAT- “wear a condom. wear two” even if this is a joke, you should probably clarify why wearing two condoms is almost as dangerous as wearing none - “girlfriend or boyfriend”- generally just the use of man and woman when you clearly mean cis man and cis woman. it’s both shocking and confusing, when coming from a trans person- some of the fonts used were hard to read. whenever there was a story from a separate person it was written in a font that hurt my eyes, and the “scary font” the bible passages were written in was near impossible to make out - the “don’t let being gay define you” section could’ve made actual points, but it came across like “don’t make it your whole personality” in a book called This Book Is Gay??- the whole thing was very sex focused and allonormative - cheat sheet term for bisexual is wrong, among others (cisGENDER has nothing to do with SEX??!) and WHY the hell are glory holes in the motherfucking cheat sheet? and eating people’s shit? ex-fucking-scuse me?! isn’t this book aimed towards kids? and shouldn’t it be more identity focused?! what is going on? - aaaaand for the finale… about ten blank pages at the back. gotta love killing trees. sigh. juno, stick to YA.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83334663-molly-quinn,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 1, 2023",0,0,"I am making my way through the most commonly banned books.This book was not written for me (I am a straight, cisgender woman in her late 20s), so take my review with however much salt as you want.This is a sex-ed book designed for older teens and adults. It is snarky and informative. The book, I'm sure, is very helpful and informative for a lot of young people who are LGBTQ+. There are some who claim the book is pornographic, and I do not think that it is at all. It's purpose is to be informative. It also does something that often sex-ed books can miss, and it talks to the audience about emotions, not just the physical stuff. I appreciated that!That all being said, there are some issues I had with the book.I feel like sometimes it misses the mark on who the audience is. At some points the writing is really juvenile (I CANNOT stand ALL the RANDOM capitalizations and mizpelled words throughout. You can tell the book was written in 2015 because it had a ""I'm so random!"" feel teens had at that point in time). But then, in the same breath, Dawson discusses things like going to night clubs and getting on Grindr. She does say that these are for people who are of age, but I don't really see this as something that required as many pages as was given to it, since the target audience of the book cannot legally do that (not to say it doesn't still happen or that these topics shouldn't be brought up at all, I just don't know if it should have made up as much of the book as it did). The sex information was not bad, it was mostly informative and talked of ways to be safe. That section will probably be too much for some teens, so be aware of that, but for others it will be very helpful.I wish the tone of the book was a little more serious at parts. There were some interesting things that the book brought up (such as discussion points to different religious argument), but it was negated by the tone (no one would be convinced by the arguments, not because the arguments are bad, but because of the tone the author uses). In general the book is needed, but I think it could have been stronger. Unfortunately this book needed to be the best because it is one of the few out there on the market. I think it could have been a bit better had it not been so goofy in tone.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31388894-sarah,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 27, 2023",0,0,"3.5 stars, and I know I'm not really the intended audience for this book, so maybe my vote should only count half.This book is heavy on the L, G, and T. B gets a few mentions, mostly where a bi person would overlap with the gay experience (of either gender). Intersex and Asexual barely get mentioned, and are pretty obviously skipped in some sections. I have read about bi, intersex, and ace people feeling erased or underrepresented in the LGBTQ+ community; I would defer to readers who identify with those communities, but if the gap was obvious even to me...The book rarely uses medical or anatomical terminology, relying heavily on slang. I found this... distasteful. Even as a teen, I probably would have suffered some second-hand embarrassment or found it cringe-worthy. I understand the position that sexuality and gender identity don't have to always be serious, it's not the end of the world, and we can have fun with it. I would again defer, this time to the target audience-- which I would give as mid-teens/older teens through people in their mid- to late-20s. This book could also be valuable for older adults (well, ""older;"" 30+), either who are just beginning to explore one or more aspects of their sexuality and/or gender, or who are newly-aware of a queer person in their life. This shouldn't be the only resource such readers use, but it's a low-stakes starting place.I read this to meet a 2023 Read Harder reading challenge: Read a book that's been challenged recently, either in your school district/library or one of the most challenge/banned books of the year by a queer and/or BIPOC author. We've fortunately not had any challenges at my public library (for a few years, actually) and I'm not aware of any challenges in the school district. This book was among those challenged this year elsewhere in the state. I see why some people might feel threatened by this content. If my teen felt the need to read this book, I would be worried (because what parent wouldn't be worried about their kid starting to explore sexuality? a lot can go wrong, and it's easy to get hurt) but I would also be very glad he was reading a book that strongly emphasized safe sex and consent. This book won't ""turn"" your kid gay but it might help them be brave enough to tell you who they really are, who they already are. Show more"

I will give her credit for having a lot of lgbt voice in this book, but how she talks about a lot of topics is really kind of strange and i don't think at the time she really understood identities outside her own (which was a cis gay men when she wrote it). so even if the people she quoted were right, whatever she said was kind of strange and really didn't feel welcoming. she keeps referring to sex as sexyfuntimes it was so werid. it has a lot of that energy through out. the book its so strange to read tbhthe reason why i give it one star is that i really dont recommend this book for young lgbt people or even people who just want to learn more about being lgbt because there are so many better books since such as Here and Queer by Rowan Ellis or The ABC's of LGBT+ by Ash Hardell (the author has since changed their name since publishing the book) are excellent books. i see this book a lot in libraries and book stores, its commonly one of the few gay books at a book store (maybe this is just australia but what i mean is i see it a lot and have over the years) and i just can't recommend it in its current state.im sure this book has helped many people, its has some useful things, but it really only seems helpful if you're a gay man and also more useful if you're cis and white too, and im not saying gay men dont need help or information about their community, they do! but the lgbt is a lot border and this book is meant to include us all and thats why i hold it to that standard.but i am really interested to read juno dawson other work, she seems cool and i assume has grown a lot in the years. I know she has written What The T, kinda the trans version of this book this year and i hope it is much better lolShow more"

It covers the basics, it explains everything relatively well, and the book has a good flow from start to finish. I should add a disclaimer that I read this with a straight & cis mindset, and you should probably read the reviews of people who belong to the lgbtqia+ community, because their opinion would obviously weigh more.-I don't particularly like the author's voice/writing style, but that's a personal thing, but I do appreciate that she has a unique voice/writing style.-Also, in case anyone wants to know, Juno Dawson is a trans woman, she wrote this book when she was a ""gay man"" (her words) and has edited and republished it post-transition (the comments in the book are a bit inconsistent in this regard, sometimes she writes as a woman and sometimes as a man, so just a heads up).-One important downside to this book is it mainly concntrates on the LGBT part of the community, there's only occasional commentary on all other genders/sexualities, so if you're looking for info on more than just LGBT, this book might not be for you.-Another downside, I've seen this comment quite a bit on other (goodreads) reviews - the following quote is made (on page 214 of my edition) which pretty much disregards aces/demis/any other sexuality/gender I don't know about that falls into this category (idk if disregards is the right word to use? My bad if it's not) : ""However, all people - gay or otherwise - must recognise that there is one universal truth of the universe : WE ALL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH LOADS OF PEOPLE."" Um. No. We do not all want that.-So besides these two problems, this book is decent, like I said, as a beginner's guide for kids.[SIDE NOTE: I'm not 100% sure this book is for kids, I just got it in the kids section of my bookstore - if you do give this to a kid, there's a lot of sex-talk, might not be too appropriate] Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46424768-francesca-cappelli,This Book Is Gay,No Rating,"July 2, 2020",0,0,"Faccio fatica a dare un giudizio su questo libro. Si propone di essere una guida per adolescenti e giovani (o per i loro genitori) che si scoprono LGBTQ+ o si fanno domande. Di buono ha che è in effetti molto semplice e immediato nel linguaggio, e offre una panoramica su molti aspetti legati non solo a sessualità, romanticismo e scoperta della propria identità di genere, ma anche culturali e sociali. Mi è piaciuto, per esempio, il capitolo sulle sottoculture e sugli stereotipi, e il continuo sfidare e smontare questi ultimi.Trovo però che ci siano vari problemi:1. Talvolta è contraddittorio. Per esempio, a un certo punto si parla di attrazione omosessuale come ""verso persone con le tue stesse parti anatomiche"" (aiuto), ma poi dopo, parlando di persone trans, si dice che ""non ci si innamora dei genitali"". Insomma, una confusione su un aspetto davvero delicato, su cui sarebbe invece importante essere chiari.2. Si parla di non binarismo e fluidità di genere, ma di base la cosa non si approfondisce mai e la maggior parte dei capitoli sono abbastanza legati a un certo binarismo.3. C'è un'irritante preferenza per l'amore e le relazioni monogame rispetto all'accoglienza di forme relazioni diverse o anche alla semplice promiscuità. Irritante non perché l'autrice non dovrebbe averla, ma perché è un suo parere che viene propagandato come ""migliore"". (Con frasi tristissime tipo ""prima o poi tutti gli amici si mettono con qualcuno, rischi di rimanere solo""... Cosa sto leggendo, esattamente?) Poi si parla (con un po' di malcelato sospetto) di coppie aperte, ma sul poliamore e le non monogamie etiche, niente.Insomma, in conclusione: non penso che possa ""fare male"" a qualcuno che si trovi a leggerlo, e magari, anzi, si sentirà anche spinto a essere più libero e sereno, e a decostruire dannosi stereotipi. Ma ci sono imprecisioni e mancanze un po' gravi, per essere ciò che si propone di essere.Meglio questo dell'articolo scritto male su un sito che di mondo LGBTQ+ non ne sa nulla? Certo.Consigliato per davvero a una persona giovane e bisognosa di consigli? Mah... Non me la sentirei del tutto.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44768797-christine,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"April 17, 2022",0,0,"I read this book because it was on the American Library Association's Top Ten Most Challenged Books of 2021 list. The second edition of the book was written after the author came out as trans woman. Therefore, I was particularly shocked and saddened to see the transphobic rhetoric presented in this book. Dawson (falsely) equated genitalia with gender identity. ""I can't state this enough: Lesbians like vaginas."" Nope! Lesbians like women. Not all women have vaginas and not all people that have vaginas are women. At least she used the correct terminology here. There were many examples of pet names used to describe genitalia. Dawson also believed that sexuality and gender identity were preferences, which was just one of the many problems I had with the following quote: ""I think we all CONSIDER sex with both men and women ... Therefore, it’s all about what we prefer sexually. We need to be open-minded at all times."" Why would a gay man, for example, need to be open-minded about having sex with women if they are not attracted to women? Also, what about asexual people who rarely or never experience sexual attraction? I do not think they are considering having sex with both men and women. The book title should have clued me in on the target audience. The book's content was heavily skewed toward cis gay males. Even bisexuality was largely ignored and too narrowly defined. It seemed like the author wrote the book based on her own personal experiences instead of doing research to all sides. For example, Dawson discussed dating apps for queer men in detail and then simply said there were also dating apps for queer women.I was also bothered by the way asexuality was presented. First of all, it was largely ignored as Dawson talked about all the sex LGBTQ+ people are having and how all LGBTQ+ consider having sex with both men and women. Secondly, Dawson stated that a more 'modern' version of asexuality was: ""refusal to define your sexual orientation or uncertainty about your sexual orientation"" and that ""a growing number of teenagers identify as asexual while figuring out their identity."" Maybe this is the more 'modern' definition of asexuality, but is a small minority of people who identify as asexual. Overall, I do not recommend this book — 1 star.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62260676-catherine-cather-reads,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"March 8, 2023",0,0,"This book is gay, and that's about it (although maybe not since this review has turned quite extensive). The book gave two promises in the beginning of the book: 1) that this book isn't just for gay people, and 2) it's not going to be taking everything seriously and it's going to joke around a bit. my critique of promise number one is that this book did not deliver on that. There's some good sex ed, great healthy education on HIV and some notes from people all over the LGBTQ+ spectrum, but if it isn't cisgender and gay, it's barely touched upon. I also didn't like how the gay portion of the sex ed was handled with a few jokes but overall gave you a clear picture of what was meant, but the lesbian sex ed was more ""childish"" with saying things like ""you know what I mean"" instead of even just using slang words to describe important elements of sex ed. I was fine if the book was just for gay people, but it's a little bit misleading that the book claims up front to be about more than just that. As for promise number 2, this book certainly delivered. Other than the lesbian sex ed, the joking didn't really get on my nerves, mostly because of the caveat mentioned in the introduction. it certainly prevented me from really enjoying it since that's not usually a writing style I enjoy, but I'm not going to take points off when the book is candid that it's going to joke around. I do wish that behind the jokes there was more data and scholarly sources. Also--(the main reason I have finally decided to lower the rating from three to two stars) This book says that most families are accepting when you come out to them. it talks a bit about that bad things can happen, but it just seems to it off by insisting that you're going to be scared, but most families are accepting. Perhaps it's my own cynicism because of how I was raised, but knowing my friend group of queer people, very few of us have supportive family members. That's not something to joke around with. This could potentially ruin someone's life and/or get them killed. I get that you're trying to assuage fears, but for a lot of us those fears exist because of real life situations. Being out of the closet is something most of us strive for, but sometimes it's just better to wait until you are safe to come out. maybe I'm just too much of a cynic but this really bothered me.Other notes: I liked that it had a really comprehensive (in my living under a rock opinion) list of LGBTQ+ celebrities and shows and definitely introduced me to some new content.It was a bit asexually exclusive by saying that ""everyone is attracted, it's just human nature"". I'm fine with the book not talking about asexuality other than just a passing sentence (because this book is Gay after all), but that was uncalled for. This book also doesn't address polyamory and definitely puts in a big vote for monogamy. It talks about open relationships, but doesn't delve into the subject more than the dangers of it. As someone who is monogamous I don't really have that vested of an interest, but since it was just another subject this book glossed over, I was very curious to know the author's real thoughts on it. Something tells me they may not be all that positive or accepting towards it.This book really wasn't written for me, so take some of my critiques with a grain of salt. I'm a nonbinary bi/ace/queer person and not a cis gay man. So if you are a cis gay man, this book is for you, but otherwise it's best for you to steer clear of it cause you will just be disappointed and potentially angry. Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18012609-sharon,This Book Is Gay,Rating 2 out of 5,"August 21, 2023",0,0,"Originally published in 2014 and described as ""a manual to all areas of life as an LGBT person"", the book has had several revisions and updates since, one of which being the change in author name as the book was originally written before Juno transitioned.I think for me, it was evident in some parts that the book had been written while the author still identified as a gay man. Repeated references to how great it is to be gay were a little jarring knowing the author as she is now.There's no doubt that it's an important book - it has been, and probably will be, the first port of call for many a confused teen - but the editing is sloppy and the humour is dated. It could do with a proper tightening up once and for all, and for a proper glossary at the back rather than the mish-mash that's there at the moment. The ""icons"" list is so out of touch it's cringe-inducing.Some aspects of the book didn't sit well with me at all - particularly the amount of focus on coming out as the only way to become a fully fledged card carrying member of ""the club"". Whilst there is later acknowledgement that it's not always safe to come out, there is little to suggest that it's your own business and absolutely NOBODY should have to make a grand public statement about who they're attracted to. The bi-erasure was disappointing, and the use of juvenile toilet humour was a let-down.I like Juno, a lot. I've read and enjoyed some of her other books, and I know she wrote one after this about being trans called ""What's the T?"" that I'd like to read at some point.I'm glad it exists - but I didn't enjoy it, unfortunately. It's maddening, because it has been targeted so much by certain people (who have an abundance of free time to harass librarians), meaning it's front and centre of many displays.But look, I'd sooner see a parent give this to their teen than shut down a conversation altogether, y'know? It's not perfect, but it has probably brought some comfort to a lonely, confused teen at one point and that can only be a good thing. Show more"

Wie z.b Homophobie, Labeln, Klischees, gleichgeschlechtlicher Sex und auch was die einzelnen Religionen dazu sagen.Für alle die entweder Homo-, Bi- oder Transsexuell sind war das Buch bestimmt hilfreich, weil es diesbezüglich fast kein Thema offen lässt. Aber! Und das ist ein großes Aber: Wenn man eben keiner dieser Sexualitäten zugehörig fühlt, dann kann einem das Buch stark das Gefühl geben, dass man unsichtbar ist. Denn, ich bin pansexuell und das es das gibt wurde in dem Buch circa ein Mal erwähnt. Und als es erwähnt wurde, wurde nur der Begriff in den Raum geworfen, aber nie erwähnt.Asexualität wurde am Anfang kurz erwähnt, aber dann später nie wieder aufgegriffen. Sehr schade, denn wenn man asexuell ist, dann hilft dieses Buch einem kaum weiter.Auch Geschlechtsidentitäten wurden nie richtig behandelt. Laut dem Buch gibt es Mann und Frau. Entweder du wirst als Frau oder Mann geboren und fühlst dich auch so, dann bist du cis. Aber wenn du als Frau/Mann geboren wirst, aber eigentlich eine Frau/Mann sein willst/bist, bist du trans. Und was ist wenn ich mich weder als Mann, noch als Frau fühle? Oder als beides? Das erwähnt das Buch nicht und das ist auch mein größtes Problem mit dem Buch.Hätte man dem Buch noch 50-100 Seiten hinzugefügt hätte man easy erklären können, dass es noch mehr Sexualitäten und Geschlechtsidentiäten gibt. Hat man bzw. die Autorin nicht. (Die Autorin weil sie mittlerweile als Frau lebt)Ich wollte dieses Buch wirklich lieben und auch wenn es gewissermaßen hilfreich sein kann für manche Personen der LGBT Community, versagt dieses Buch dennoch daran zu erwähnen, dass LGBT aus mehr als nur L,G, B & T besteht.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96661225-lauren,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"August 19, 2019",0,0,"Overall, this is a fun, quick read, and I'm SO glad that it exists. I would have loved to have this as a teenager.There are a few things that I find problematic:The author, Juno Dawson, mentions gender non-conforming people and then spends almost no time discussing or defining what that means. I wish she had given a little more attention to genderqueer identities outside of binary trans people. She also mentions asexuality and defines it, but barely discusses it throughout the book.Dawson also conflates gender with genitalia, often stating that no matter how effeminate a man is or how butch a woman is, if someone has a penis they're a man and if someone has a vagina they're a woman. Now, this is a little weird seeing as she has come out as a transgender woman since publishing this book, but of course I don't fault her (or anyone) for continuing to figure out who she is and changing her identity accordingly. Obviously, learning about yourself and figuring out your identity is what this book is about. And, while she sometimes conflates gender with genitalia, trans people and their identities get a decent amount of attention in the book.It's important to make sure that we're being inclusive to all, especially in a book that's about LGBT+ people and figuring out your own identity/identities.Some of the language is a little cheeky and I felt like the author was, at times, trying too hard to connect with the teen audience. Then again, I'm in my late 20s, so maybe teens like it. I recognize that I'm not the primary audience for this book.All that said, this book is fun, full of helpful definitions--though there could be more-- and discusses coming out, dating, sex, meeting people online, gay clubs, resources, and more. Dawson also doesn't shy away from discussing HIV, STDs, predators, and other not-so-fun parts of LGBT history and being queer in general. I would recommend it to LGBT teenagers and their parents.

Other reviewers were much more thoughtful and eloquent than I could hope to be, so give a browse through other comments before deciding whether to read, but my main concerns are as follows. First, the book didn't acknowledge the gray/ace experience; there was a definition of asexuality, but that was about it. I listened on audio so I can't find the exact quote, but somewhere along the line the author said, ""We all want to have lots of sex with lots of people!"" and as a person on the gray/ace spectrum, I was like, ""Do we?"" In another part, the author said something like, ""When you see someone you like, you fancy them,"" implying sexual attraction, and went so far as to say that if a reader disagreed with this, they would be lying. Grghhhhh. Nooo. Not everyone experiences sexual attraction in the same way, or at all! You just said you'd call me a liar for acknowledging an identity you defined in the very first part of your book?I get that a book can only cover so much, but commentary like this felt flippant for a book that proposed to be very inclusive. Had this been a different book I wouldn't even have noticed, but I guess I was geared up for a different experience turning these pages.Second, there were problematic statements about gender. I certainly don't propose to say that the author intended to be exclusionary by any means, but again, it felt like statements intended to be humorous or playful came across as flippant. Again, I was listening on audio so I don't have the exact quote, but something like, ""Is one man the woman and one the man? No! They both have a penis."" Genitals do not equal gender.Overall, I feel like the intent of the book is great and it would be so helpful for sooo many people to read--but I also think inclusion was occasionally sacrificed for humor.Show more"

Some friends of mine and I are started a banned book club, and we chose this as our first book to see just what the screaming was about.Big shocker: ALL of the attacks being lobbied at this book are COMPLETELY unfounded, and anyone making them CLEARLY hasn't actually read the book, but is simply repeating propaganda from Fox News.This book isn't pornographic in the slightest, nor is it ""grooming"" children. It's no more explicit or graphic than any other book used in high school sex education, which is exactly the point of the book. Dawson, who is a transgender woman, wrote it to act essentially as a supplement to the standard sex ed books so that LGBTQIA+ students could be educated on things that pertain more specifically to them, but she also wrote it in a way that is accessible to everyone, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. I'm a cisgender guy in my late 30s, and I actually learned SEVERAL things from this book, which is exactly the point: we don't know what we don't know, and we can't pretend otherwise.I highly recommend this book for just about everyone, but I PARTICULARLY recommend it for LGBTQIA+ teens and young adults, as well as for their friends and families, as it can answer SO many questions. I actually do think this book should be taught in high schools, as a part of sex education, and it should be in all high school libraries as well.There's a great line in the movie ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", where the principal is trying to help Holland understand what being a teacher means, saying that ""A teacher is two jobs. Fill young minds with knowledge, yes. But more important, give those minds a compass so that that knowledge doesn't go to waste.""

It also addresses stereotypes, role models, the history, advise on coming out and where in the world being LGBTQ+ is criminalised. So many important topics which also deconstruct common stereotypes about queer people and give a sense of community and identity. And the chapter on gay sex is prefaced by 'if you don't feel comfortable reading about this, skip this chapter'. So very thought-out and considerate. Consequently, if you are a teen who doesn't have access to people with whom you feel comfortable talking about such matters, then this book would be a great help. So restricting that access is terrible. It is targeted towards young teens in my opinion and I think it adresses all issues well to a certain degree. It tells you what to do if you are getting bullied and embraces the idea of being yourself which I think is fantastic. However, I do think that the people who will profit most of all from this book are gay men. Lesbian equivalents of dating apps were not mentioned for example and it was quite gay centered. Lesbians might also be able to take something away from this book too, but especially gay men. Also sometimes there were some quite sweeping statements made, like 'everybody wants to have sex with loads of people' which is just not true. Eventhough the author mentioned that it was not the same for asexual people, it is still a very broad statement to make. So this book could have been more inclusive in providing options and examples for all sexualites and gender identities.But yeah, generally, definitely not a book to be banned.Show more"

I rated it low because it's male-oriented and has little guidance for females. As a male, I was very represented by this book. But the females are MTFs were not represented well in this at all. I want equality in my media, and that means the book should cover both penises and vaginas.Not just penises.It covered trans fairly well, but also roughly. ""Some boys want to be a girl"", no, some girls are born in boy bodies. There's no want, they are born like that! So the trans area sort of washes it into ""wanting"" not they are born trans and trapped in the wrong body. This was where one star went. I cannot abide by this ignorance in a book like this. A book, mind you, that young children are reading. They need to understand transitioning and such is not a mere want or desire, it's a serious situation.I can see people taking the trans part of this book out and weaponizing it.Now as for the lack of vaginas. There's not enough talk about the female side of STDS and bad sex. Females are definitely not this book's focus. I guess by ""gay"" we mean only gay men. Not gay women. Aight. So we barely cover periods, UTIS, etc. We don't cover vaginism, hymens, bleeding, etc near enough if at all. Very disappointing. There's literally nearly or nothing about vagina problems, PCOS, etc that's the reason another star vanished.These are serious things girls should be taught about. Along with pregnancy, how consent works, and more. As a person who grew into an adult before this book, this book could have saved me UTIs and bad sexual experiences, and it needs to be more inclusive.

Overall it's a great read and I would recommend this book if you don't know anything about the LGBT* community or very little. If you know a lot about the LGBT* community then you don't really need this book. It would just tell you things you already probably know so you're better off picking up a different book.The illustrations are awesome too! Some of them made me chuckle. They made the book even more fun to read.Regarding myself, I learned a lot about different terms and in general more about LGBT*. I really like the way Juno wrote the book. Her writing style, her humor, and the little references that she makes that are in the book were great. I do wish she included of how her transition was from male to female. It would have been cool and interesting to learn how her transition was especially since in the book she identified as a gay man since she was male when the book was in publication the first time around. It was also odd how the tips for parents was at the end of the book. I felt like that should have been at the beginning or earlier in the book, but I did like the terms at the end of the book and how it listed helpful websites and organizations. My other compliant was that there wasn't much on lesbian sex which kind of makes sense since the book was written by a male at the time, but it would have been nice if there was more information on that. 69 was under the terms at the of the book, but that wasn't even mentioned in the book which I thought was a bit odd.Overall it was a good read and I loved the book.

Juno Dawson si prefiggeva di scrivere il manuale per tuttə, ma per lo più ne ha scritto uno per chi è omosessuale: il resto viene giusto citato, senza dare spazio alla cultura che ogni lettera della comunità ha creato intorno a sé.Probabilmente non ci avrei fatto troppo caso se, nel primo capitolo, l’autrice non avesse specificato con squilli di trombe che questo libro era per tuttə, a prescindere dalla tua identità di genere o dalla tua preferenza sessuale (che già preferenza sessuale sembra richiami a una possibilità scelta e m’è parsa subito un’espressione infelice, e non è la sola, purtroppo… tipo sesso gay non si può leggere, visto che il sesso è sesso, non è che ha un orientamento).Il punto è che non puoi scrivere un libro inclusivo se ti ricordi delle varie parti della comunità LGBTQIA+ solo quando ne parli in maniera esplicita. Per esempio, quando si parla di uomini, sarebbe bene non dare per scontato che tutti abbiano il pene. Oppure, quando si parla di relazioni, sarebbe il caso di ricordarsi che non tuttə ne vogliono una romantica. O ancora, non è che le persone bisessuali sono uguali a quelle omosessuali quando stanno con qualcunə del loro stesso genere e uguali a quelle eterosessuali altrimenti.Poteva essere un libro carino e pop su cosa voglia dire far parte della comunità LGBTQIA+, ma se non siete uomini gay, è probabile che troverete diverse mancanze in questo libro (pure le donne lesbiche o le persone trans, secondo me, non troveranno granché utile la lettura di questo libro, pur essendo le categorie più citate dopo gli uomini gay).Show more"

Conversations about GNC people and the fluidity of sexuality in 2014 felt like they still went way beyond the binary of gender and sexuality (though definitely not to the point of today's standards). This book heavily focuses on gay men, touches on lesbians, hints at bi people and trans people, but fails to mention non-binary identities and other sexual orientations (like pansexual) that were pretty well known in the queer community at the time. I understand this book is supposed to be a first step into learning about what it means to be queer and the LGBTQ+ community, but educators do a disservice to many queer youths by not even acknowledging how diverse the queer community is beyond just gay men, lesbians, and binary trans people. I know that there has been a new edition of this book within the past few years, but judging by the other reviews here not much of the content in the book was changed other than just updating Juno Dawson's name and how she identifies.The two main pros of this book:Juno Dawson's voice is easy to read and she's clearly quite intelligent and well researched on the topics she chose to include (but honestly if you're interested in Juno as an educator just listen to one of her interviews and skip this book). The other main pro of this book is that it great on a bookshelf, which is such a frivolous thing to say, especially when saying it's one of the reasons you liked a book. But the spine does look aesthetically pleasing if you have a shelf of queer books colour coordinated, just put this book on one of the ends of the rainbow and it's like a perfect little final touch.

Io bene, anche se per ragioni legate alle consegne da fare (sto scrivendo e chi scrive ha le scadenze, come l’Imu, la Tari o le mozzarelle) ho un mal di testa che mi acceca. Mi rammenta di quella volta che a scuola avevo una forte emicrania. Il mio prof di religione intanto diceva che l’omosessualità è una malattia, al che io gli chiesi se potevo andare a casa perché mi sentivo un po’ gay. Disse di no.A proposito di questioni di genere e di studenti: oggi vi segnalo il saggio di Juno Dawson, Questo libro è gay, edito da Edizioni Sonda. In realtà, è molto più che gay: è una divertente spiegazione (con tante illustrazioni) circa le differenze di genere sia dal punto di vista sociale che biologico (come identificarle e superarle), gli stereotipi e come smontarli, come affrontare il delicato momento del coming out e, non ultimo, come affrontare (e sperimentare) la sessualità in sicurezza (cosa che dovreste fare tutti ma che vi ostinate a delegare ad amici che si atteggiano e a siti pop-porno).Un testo per tutti, perché (che lo si voglia o no) tutti i ragazzi prima o poi attraversano il momento in cui si pongono certe domande. Nel libro sono riportate numerose testimonianze di chi ha dovuto affrontare dubbi, paure, preoccupazioni, discriminazioni. Come uscirne? Il libro di Dawson può essere un buon compagno (che porterei anche nelle scuole e non solo per fare dispetto al mio prof di religione) che può aiutarti a stare bene nella tua pelle, qualunque essa sia. Perché parla di noi e, prima di tutto, non esiste un’etichetta di “normale” o una di giusto o di sbagliato: esistono le persone.Se volete fare un regalo ai vostri figli, oltre all’indipendenza e all’autonomia (cose okay, indispensabili) insegnate loro a non avere pregiudizi.

I wish it went into more details about our history, especially a mentioning about how harmful TERFs are in the UK.There is good information about safe sex which is always important to talk about, but I had to cross out a part when Juno made a comment about wearing two condoms, the comment wasn't serious but something like that should never be encouraged, it should actually be about how wearing two is worse than wearing one.There are also points about how family members will come around eventually, while it is great to be optimistic, it is also important to remember that validation from your parents isn't the be all and end all of being yourself. Yes, parents need a bit of time to get used to things, but also, there is a line when it is clear they are refusing to get used to you being you and people shouldn't force themselves to deal with a bigot in hopes that they'll ""come around eventually""Overall, the book is an okay introduction to terms, statistics, small tidbits of history and safe sex but I don't recommend this book as the best way to get your information from, this book barely touches the surface level on queer history and how complex experiences can truly be.

This book is gay. And cis for a good chunk. And almost exclusively binary.I'd recommend this book for a cis gay boy, maybe a cis gay girl. Someone that's bi? Maybe, but not really. Someone that's trans? Despite the fact that the author identified as a trans woman a year or two after this book was released, and the fact that it does bring up some trans issues, it does simplify things a lot and does include some harmful ideas, such as trans people ""wanting"" to be the opposite gender. It also had a tendency to equate gender to genitalia, which is also harmful. As for people who are nonbinary or asexual? Forget it. Despite being defined in the first chapter, the fact that these types of people exist is basically forgotten immediately afterward. The language is extremely binary, as mentioned before. And, despite the author writing the following in bold lettering, ""we all want to have sex with loads of people"" is NOT accurate for everyone.That's not to say that this book doesn't have its positives. It is extremely uplifting and approaches almost everything with a positive attitude. There is quite a bit of valuable information in here. And I loved the testimonies from LGBT+ people all sorts of types. I would definitely recommend this to a teenage boy who thinks he might be gay. It's probably helpful to gay teenage girls as well (though there is a lot more of a focus on gay men than women). Or the parent of a child who is gay. Or just someone who wants to understand the experiences of gay people better. Anyone else, though? Not really, because THIS BOOK IS GAY.Show more"

It is heavily geared towards gay men and a lot of the jokes don't really land if you are on the ace spectrum or are bi/pan/omni. Also some of the terms that are considered okay by the book (maybe because its written in 2013 or because the author is British) I would not recommend people using (most people ik say to use trans or transgender - transsexual is pretty dated and could be taken offensively). It does an okay job running through different aspects of life and probably answers a lot of the burning questions straight people have, but I was really hoping to hear more about the history of the LGBT community. I feel like if it had included more history, then it wouldn't feel so dated - also, the history is important for people in the community and out to understand things like 'why the LGBT community might be hesitant to include police officers at pride if they are in uniform' or 'why certain politicians are terrible because their homophobia prevented them from alleviating the problems of the HIV/AIDS crisis.' Not knowing these things allows straight people to brush off the concerns of the LGBT community as being unreasonable - therefore I think it is important for this history to be in any book that is considering itself a guide to LGBT.EDIT: Reading some of the other comments have reminded me or enlightened me about things I did not put in the first part of my review. I would highly recommend scrolling through and reading some of the other comments (usually two star ones) because they highlight a lot of other slip ups that I don't feel like writing about.

I wanted this to be the book I could recommend to people, especially young people, to learn about everything LGBTQ+. I just... didn't like it.This book tried to outline what it means to be LGBTQ+ as well as what it means to live and love in society. I feel, however, there was no way to cram all of the pertinent information into such a small book. This book leaves out so much that I, personally, would want someone to know. The way culture and knowledge have shifted in the few years since this book was written has also made a lot of it feel outdated, already.A lot of the book seems to be geared more towards what white, cisgender, gay men have to face and leaves out everyone else or painstakingly sweeps them under a rug. There is barely any mention of pansexuality, asexuality, or any other sexual identity beyond the LGB. There's a small paragraph on intersex people, but doesn't give any useful information, whatsoever, as if there aren't many of these people (there's an estimate that there are more intersex people in the world than redheads). There is also little to no focus on LGBTQ+ people of other races.What truly bothered me about this book is the way the author talks about trans people. This is especially disappointing considering they, themselves, have since come out as a trans woman. Saying things like ""sometimes men want to be women and women want to be men"" is just so wrong to me. I also took great issue with the repeated line that ""lesbians only want/love vaginas"" completely discrediting trans women in loving lesbian relationships.This book might be a good introduction for somebody that has honestly never heard a thing about LGBTQ+ people, but, overall, I'd have to pass on it.Show more"

Also in der ersten Fassung aus der Perspektive eines schwulen Mannes. Die aktualisierte Fassung stammt von ihr als heterosexueller Frau -- was meines Erachtens von der Übersetzung schlecht gelöst wurde.Dawsons Transsexualität wird zwar zu Beginn erläuter und auch die sich gewandelte Perspektive. Der text springt dann jedoch oft zurück über das erzählen von Dawson als schwulen Mann, inklusiver maskuliner Fromen von Wörtern. (Vielleicht, weil sich für manch eine*n Übersetzer*in ""author"" ganz automatisch in ""Autor"" statt in ""Autorin"" oder ""Autor*in"" übersetzt.)Ich habe das Buch als Erwachsene gelesen, der das Thema nicht neu ist.Zur Zielgruppe - Jugendliche - gehöre ich somit nicht. Ich denke aber, dass die Einteilung in 14 Kapitel und darin mehrere, abschnittkurze Unterkapitel auch Lesemuffeln das Buch schmackhaft machen. Ebenso die vielen Comichaften Illustrationen (die btw sehr im Stil von Aufklärungsbücher-aus-der-Schulbibliothek gehalten sind).

While I think the intentions of the book are good, it is outdated, to the point that even the most recent revisions don’t do the book justice. Published originally in 2014, almost 10 years on, the language is off, the terminology is off, the editing is poor. Originally published prior to Juno publicly transitioning, there are still references to life as a gay man. This book has been revised a few times & yet that hasn’t been edited, which is sloppy. And icons at the back of the book really could be removed. A fun idea but definitely not the most up to date references & comparing this edition in the photo to the most recent edition, the updated list has removed a few trans people. And is lacking mentioning important people like Marsha P. Johnson in the first place. It does continue to list Oprah, saying ‘outspoken NOT LESBIAN television personality’ which is so tackyI felt like the terminology used, particularly for body parts & sexual acts, was juvenile. And look, it is a book written for teens but it doesn’t mean it should be dumbed down.‘If you’re ready to come out, congratulations! Now you’ve got your membership card’, this idea of being out & therefore a card carrying legitimate member of LGBTQ+ community, right after a section on why you might not chose to come out, is a bit distasteful. A section on open relationships could have been updated to speak more about polyamorous relationships rather than just open relationships.In the interest of balance, this book is written for me. So what might a teenager take away from this positively? I like that there is a focus on safe sex and resources for young LGBTQ+ people.Show more"

One of the biggest criticisms that I have seen is that this book is focused on the gay male experience and excludes those who are transgender, ace, lesbian, etc. When there is more commentary on gay men, the author does a great job of calling it out. For example, the author discusses more research on gay men because there is a lack of research on bi or lesbian women and also a lack of research on trans individuals. As a master's of health science student THIS IS TRUE. WOMEN ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN RESEARCH. The author even interviews others to get a wide array of views and opinions on different experiences. I also think it's hilarious that people are saying that trans individuals are underrepresented in this book when the AUTHOR IS TRANS HERSELF. The whole point that the author makes is that every trans person is different--different anatomy, needs, and desires. There is no one way to describe the trans experience. A whole book could be written about this (and the author has written a book for those who are trans or nonbinary).Yes, I will say that a large portion of this book is dedicated to describing dating and sex and if you are not interested in this information, this book may not be for you. This book also discussed romance and love aside from sex. Even if you don't want this information for yourself, it may still be useful to know. If you lend or give this book to someone who may need it, this may be information that they need to know.

This is perhaps the biggest and least accessible area of American culture. I was really moved to see James repeat that they are the same as us.In fact, I think the book should be censored because its introduction to the LGBTQ+ community is likely to remain a dualist, even if it involves the oppression of homosexuality in Islam, which may hurt the liberation of some religious people.I have to say James may have some misgivings so his analysis is too superficial. It can be said to be an introduction to the LGBTQ+ community, but it is difficult to touch others and gain the support and understanding of staunch bisexuals，This is what I think it's pity.It is undeniable that it is necessary for students to see homosexuals, bisexuals, asexuals, and even queers. It's hard for me to imagine how much harm a group of children can cause unconsciously to those around them who may have LGBTQ + tendencies when they don't understand this knowledge. The psychological trauma children suffer at an early age will accompany them for a lifetime. So if the book can be introduced to children to give them a sense of understanding and confidence in human diversity, it will reduce their discriminatory tendencies or fears.I may selectively introduce this book to my children, and I mean that I will not introduce it completely in my classroom. Because some of his opinions I can't agree with, James's prejudices about sexual knowledge may not be suitable for my children, although he may have a lot of biological knowledge.

Luckily, my local library had it. So, I was able to finally read it. This was a really good handbook of all things queer. It covered a wide range of topics and would likely help any person who is questioning their sexual or gender identity for the first time. The writing had a very conversational style that was easy to read and incredibly funny at times. However, there were also times that it felt a bit too flippant, in my opinion. I liked the positive attitude it had, though, and it tackled really heavy, important topics in an accessible way. My only real problem was that it seemed to push coming out as a panacea for everyone. The author did note many of the major drawbacks some people face when coming out, but that felt dwarfed by the attitude that coming out will make it all better. I agree that being out has great benefits, especially to mental health, but not everyone is in a situation where they can be out to everyone all the time. Even though the author acknowledged that fact, it still felt almost as if being closeted was belittled. My favorite thing about the book was the inclusion of all the different voices. The author conducted surveys and interviews with a variety of LGBT individuals, and their words and stories were included here and provided valuable perspectives. Overall, this book was an accessible wealth of information about being and living queer that I'm sure many young people (and parents) will find immensely helpful.

As with modern times, it includes tips for online dating/sex apps, as well as breaking down the variety of options for nontraditional relationships/families that are not truly shown in media or educational materials. I enjoyed the messages of the importance of standing up to hate & being an inclusive ally, putting the responsibility on everyone in society to stamp out bigotry & ignorance. It was eye-opening to learn of the lack of protections in various modern countries/historically, and the book offers a helpful guide for which countries have the harshest laws against homosexuality. It also included a comparison of different religions & where they stand on gay inclusion. While the tone & language of the content felt overly trendy in an attempt to relate or fit in with the younger generations, it does have quite a bit of good information provided that is nearly always excluded from the youth sex education realm.

Officially, it must be because of the glossary of sex terms and the diagrams of naughty bits, but really I think it’s the aggressive way it attempts to normalize members of the LGBTQ community that gets under the skin of certain parts of the population.It provides a basic understanding of the many terms that can be new and confusing. It explains how trans people might begin by socially transitioning before considering hormone blockers and how surgical operations would only happen (if they happen at all) when they’re adults. It gives possible instructions on how to come out and what kind of support and irrational rejection out teens should expect at home and at school.And through this all, it bolsters the idea that people living non-traditional lifestyles of whatever kind are doing nothing wrong, they’re only unique in a slightly different way than everyone else. Even being a G doesn’t really tell you that much about a person when there is so much else that goes into who individuals are.There is a part of my mind that has to wonder: can’t most adolescents find this stuff online or by talking to their friends? Some of my students are more conscious of the recent changes in gender terminology than I am. And I suppose they can use other sources, but, perhaps, they’ll get more accurate and efficient answers here (even if they also get some wayward sections on dating apps and dating in general).It’s not a book that’s going to change any of the hardliners’ minds, but it can definitely be very affirming for those who are young and still a little confused.Show more"

I had some wonderful and wild experiences in the very early 1970s when most of LGBTQ community was “underground” (this in Hollywood and LA) that taught me acceptance and a small bit of understanding.At times the book seemed at little campy to me, but that didn’t detract from the information given. It’s rather complicated and complex for someone like me which also makes it clear to me that a person doesn’t “choose” to be gay or trans. I didn’t choose to be heterosexual, it’s who I am.I rather wish that as a teen in the 60s I’d had a hetero book of this kind to guide me through the confusion of puberty, dating, sex, love etc. As it is, like so many kids, I stumbled my way through. I really like that time and time again the author encourages the reader to take full responsibility for their behavior, that yes, sex is fun but it’s not the end all and be all, and encourages people to be themselves, damn the torpedoes full steam ahead. She also provides websites and places to get information and further education.

I do feel more grounded in who I like and what I prefer (or rather, don’t) sexually.I loved the writing style of this book! It’s fun and light enough that, when you get to the more serious parts, it’s not TOO serious. The wacky illustrations probably help with that. (I personally didn’t care for them, but I understand their purpose now.)While I’m glad Juno revised the book, I do think there’s more that could be added. In the past two years since the book was revised, I can say there’s been an increase in new terms for sexualities and the people who identify with them. This Book is Gay primarily dealt with the basic sexualities: gay, bi, trans, and so on. There wasn’t as much information on things like Asexual and Aromantic (which I think I might be) or combinations of sexualities. I would’ve liked to see that!Overall, this is a wonderful book!

However, some of the language this book uses, such as equating gender to genitalia, like the many jokes of ""lesbians like vaginas"" come across as annoying and slightly outdated. The book focuses too much on a gender binary that a book like this shouldnt. Its also, very gay centric, anyone other than a gay man wont get the full experience of this book. The simplification of any other identity of gay/lesbian is apparent. I can only assume that the author herself feels the same, as a trans women. She originally published this book as a gay man which, like she states at the beginning of the book, hides a huge understanding of other experiences.

This book definitely plays a major part in that.This book covers so many areas pertinent to LGBTQ teens. There's information about coming out, relationships, starting families, stereotypes, religious views about LGBTQ issues, and most importantly, sex. With so many school districts clamping down on sex education under the guise that it's not age appropriate, which is complete hooey, this book devotes a whole chapter to safe sex, what sex looks like for LGBTQ people, and many other issues and topics LGBTQ teens need. It's such an important chapter and I am so glad the author included it in the book.The author presents all of this information with a great sense of humor which makes this a light and enjoyable informational read.

Juno Dawson, however, offers honest, witty, and entertaining information within her book This Book is Gay – those who are aware of Juno Dawson (if you haven’t then, seriously, where have you been?) you will know that she has a bit of experience living as an LGBTQ+ woman.She discusses the often unavailable information about living in this community to an audience who have very limited experience. Those who are either taking tentative steps to understand their part in the LGBTQ+ community or friends and family who also have limited knowledge and want to be supportive.Juno Dawson addresses the inadequacies in the school system – why is heteronormative sex the only thing taught in schools; she looks at dating and how difficult it can be. She also talks to people who are LGBTQ+ so we don’t feel that her writing is preachy. She is and has lived it and she knows what she is talking about but you don’t feel talked AT.I firmly believe that This Book is Gay should be issued to schools. Young students who are struggling to find their place would find this book so comforting and feel that there is somewhere that they can feel included. That someone out there, beyond the microcosm of their small world knows what it feels like.I was genuinely in awe of this book.Show more"

Unfortunately the narrator they chose sounded a little condescending through the whole thing, but that’s not the book’a fault. I think I would have thought this book was just about perfect before I took a gender sexuality and feminist studies course, but after taking one last semester there were more problems that I noticed within the book. The author was not exactly understanding of other cultures or the broader history of homophobia being an imperialist belief in a lot of places and just sort of condemned all places that weren’t gay-friendly, without talking about how the people in those places weren’t necessarily to blame. He just sort of talked about all of them in a way that was bordering on racist. He also could have talked a lot more about intersectionality, which is super important. And even if he himself didn’t know a lot about it, he could have enlisted the help of people who hold many different intersectional or historically marginalized identities. My main criticism, though was that he spent almost no time taking about people who identify outside the gender binary and constantly talked about dismantling cisheteronormative standards while using language that ended up reinforcing he gender binary. All in all, though, this book was trying to do a lot- a dressing everything a young LGBTQ person might need to know, and it did a pretty good job. No book that tries to do that will be perfect.Show more"

A lot of the time I am still in the ""questioning"" mindset. The point is that I might be ignorant about some topics that I cannot personally relate to. But I am always trying to learn, which is why I read this book.I think this book is a good stepping stone for young people who want to learn more about the LGBTQ+ community, but I wouldn't recommend it as the be-all-end-all. A lot of the information is very condensed and so has lost a lot of important context. It's also not as inclusive as it touts. It focuses mostly on cis gay men, and other identities or topics are only briefly mentioned--and in some cases, incorrectly. There is also some transphobic language. Another thing--although not nearly the most important--is that This Book is Gay is supposed to be humorous, but I didn't find it funny at all. It was pretty juvenile.I did like the author's reminder that whatever labels you adopt--or don't--, your identity is valid. I think that's a very important message, especially for young people. I also really appreciated the section in the back for LGBTQ+ charities and organizations. This book does contain some good advice, especially about how to handle ""coming out,"" or what to do if you're being harassed, but I would caution people to approach this book with a healthy dose of skepticism--and then to do further research.Show more"

Especially if you're transgender - there are so many slip-ups in this book, it's clearly obvious that Dawson didn't get any input from transgender beta readers before his manuscript was published. Listen up, everyone - 'transsexuals' is extremely outdated and an inaccurate way of describing your transgender friends or family. Despite stating that sexuality and gender are two different things, Dawson defines transsexuals as ""men who want to be women, and women who want to be men, and use surgery and hormone therapy to change"". Sigh. Not to mention the constant reminders of, ""penis = man , vagina = woman"". Cue eye-roll.I decided to 'DNF' this book at page 90. While I'm glad books like this exist for young people nowadays (had I had resources like this growing up, it likely wouldn't have taken me so long to realize I'm a homoromantic asexual trans guy, which was difficult as fuck to figure out on my own, well into my early twenties), I'm disappointed in the inaccuracies, and heavy bias toward gay, cis males.

There is a weight to writing something like this, which I recognize, but as queer writers, we have to be cognizant of the fact we are showing people how to talk about us, and this small sample stands for the entirety of the various minority communities in the LGBT+ community for people who haven't had contact with us before. As a book that wants to badly claim to be inclusive, there is a a lot in the language and tone that speaks to one part of the community. Specifics for a revision:p85: Where are the references for saying LGBT+ is a protected class? Where are references for any of the statistics or claims?p108: The author chooses to shame sex work.p180: Much like most of the book, a single viewpoint is used to show the experience of a whole. If a new lesbian reads this as their first introduction to their community, reading they will never orgasm with a strap-on, and that it's hard work, is not only inaccurate, but is off putting to being open to new experiences. Encouraging curiosity and learning, or at least including multiple voices where the author lacks knowledge would be a better way to go. p210: Total erasure of people on the asexual spectrum.

Filled with visual aids such a graphs, and cartoons, Dawson adopted a cheery, albeit at times sarcastic, tone while navigating the nuances of LGBT+ identities, and explaining the process of coming out. What I DID enjoy reading about was the breakdown of different identities, and the inclusion of (safe) sex practices once you have come out and wish to engage with the community in a sexual way. What I did not enjoy, was that, as the book progressed, it began to lean heavily on the homosexual male experience, with some attempts to include lesbians. Transgender males and females were sometimes mentioned, but after the beginning, there was little to no discussion of non-binary and asexual individuals. The title, ""This Book is Gay"" invites this, I suppose, but since the blurb specified the text would discuss ""sexual orientation and gender identity"", I found the narrowing of ""LGBTQIA+"" to just ""LG"", with an exceptionally heavy emphasis on sexual attraction and sex, disappointing. I think this was a case of my expectations not being met. That said, if you are a young adult who is struggling with questions about your sexual orientation (but not necessarily your gender identity), then YES, this book is a good starting place.Show more"

I really never considered it and I am NOT a liar. The author made a poor choice in placing that statement in the book.She also mentions that homophobes are bigots and says that's their problem. I might add that it becomes your problem if they are violent and that can happen.She also talks about sex prostitutes being required to have HIV testing against their will and not approving of that, but isn't that for the protection of both the prostitute and the client???Must say I really wasn't interested in the how-to in the section on gay sex, but I can see the value in it.All in all it's an interesting book, but it got a little overwhelming by the end.Good dictionary in the back and a nice section for parents who have a child who might be gay.Show more"

The humour and terminology used is quite juvenile in places and a lot of comments do tend to miss their mark.It does need to be mentioned that the book was written by Juno as a gay male before she transitioned and I think the struggles she was experiencing at the time with her own identity unfortunately shine through.It annoys me to rate the book so low, especially given the far right rhetoric and false quotes thrown about however it's also far from a balanced inclusive look at the LGBTQIA+ world as a whole.The book isn’t terrible in its entirety and it may be a good starting point for a confused teen or conversation starter however there are many more books out there which cover this topic better.

Maybe it was just at the time of writing this book or something (at the time Juno Dawson identified as cis male with he/him pronouns, but is now a transgender woman using she/her), but I don't think she fully grasped the transgender experience. Really just the lgbt experience in general. There's poor wording like ""lesbians like vaginas"" (which is kinda iffy because some woman do not have vaginas, but that doesn't mean they aren't women). There's a part where she's basically saying transgender people are people who want to be another gender. No one in the LGBT community *wants* to be this way. We just are. Like a lesbian doesn't wake up one day and say, ""you know what i'm gonna be gay because it seems fun"". A transgender woman doesn't just wake up and go, ""hmm i think women are pretty! i'm gonna be like them now!""It's much deeper than that, you know?

Best for gay, lesbian, and trans information. Asexuals get mentioned and then steamrolled (and at one point accused of being liars since, to paraphrase: 'anyone who doesn't imagine having sex all the time with multiple people are lying') and bisexuals have some information but mostly get a consolatory pat on the back because their sexuality isn't really seen as an ""endgame"" sexuality. There's some weirdly worded trans-gatekeeping (and some transphobia mixed in), but otherwise reading this is like reading a 2012 Tumblr text post but with slightly better formatting. Narrator was annoying and highly opinionated, even accidentally suggesting in the 2014 version that you can only have love in monogamous relationships and therefore shitting on every polyamorous person ever (this has been fixed).

It's not a great resource and i feel that people will use it to reinforce negative and incorrect perspectives of the LGBTQ+ community. The author's understanding of the LGBTQ+ scene is from a very caucasian, English perspective. The writing style seems intended to come across as young, hip, and relatable but often felt tonally dissonant with the topic or an untimely embrace of camp. A lot of topics that require nuance are handled pretty ham fistedly with no consideration for conveying an honest understanding of the topic; they are presented from the author's perspective and you are to take her word for it, end of duscussion. This book is also unfair in its representation of polyamorous people and their role in gay (or even straight) culture. They are represented only as ""promiscuous"" people, then negatively stereotyped as ""lonely"" and ""sitting at the freak table"". There are a lot of harmful stereotypes and behaviors. The author spent time to say that stereotypes are bad, but then continues to say hey they exist so use them to clock other queer people. Which is just plain disrespectful. Again, very caucasian experiences with little acknowledgement of POC or disabled queer folk. Not a great guide, but if you don't have many other options you may as well give it a read.Show more"

There is chapter on history, which is very interesting to read, and see how far the world has come to.

There are many diagrams/charts, and the book doesn't take itself too seriously; it's a fun, witty and handles all the basics without getting too hysterical. The book covers many topics, which should be included in the schools sex ed. lessons.If you're a parent with teenagers, definitely give this book a read, to understand what they may be going though & leave it on an available bookshelf in the house; & don't freak out if it goes missing. Overall great & fun read, but as mentioned earlier this is targeted for teenagers. There are many useful contacts for different LGBTQIA+ groups and charities that can help whoever needs it.

I also appreciated the upbeat, positive tone of this book.What lacked in the book, if this is really considered a guide, is a discussion of consent to sex. This is important for any person, gay or straight, cisgender, transgender or nonbinary, bisexual or asexual, etc. There is plenty of discussion of different types of grownup relationships and dating and so on, but the issue of consent is fundamental to any kind of relationship or even a very short-lived encounter, and this is especially important for teens. The author doesn’t really get into that. For that reason, it seems like this book is for young adults.Also, on the topic of HIV/AIDS, the author states that women can contract it through oral sex. The author doesn’t mention all the other ways women can come in contact with HIV/AIDS, and I certainly hope this is better addressed in future editions of this book.

The book is a good guide for young teens, in particular young gay males that are starting out in the gay world or are still on their journey to figure stuff out. There are guides to dating and coming out and all the typical steps and aspects of most queer guys and gals. Personally, I skimmed most parts because I already knew the things from my own experience. What I enjoyed were some references to religion and politics - and I wished the book had adressed some more of that - and some of the personal stories submitted to the author. I didn't like that it didn't put any attention to some of the identities. Primary focus was put on the cis gay man, although trans issues were raised frequently, though I can't attest to their accuracy. Overall the author gave it a good try.

So here it goes.I gave this book three stars for a two reasons. 1) I didn't find this book to be inclusive enough. It's definitely written from a very cisgendered, gay male viewpoint. That should be expected, since the author is a gay cis man. I just thought there could have been more effort on his part to use more inclusive language. I also found the use of binary language to be troublesome, and could potentially prevent genderqueer/non-binary people from really getting the most out of this book. 2) Plain and simple, I didn't really like the writing quality. Of course, this a YA non-fiction book, so I expected things to be simplified, but personally I found it to be a little too over the top at times, and while it's good to keep things silly and light, I just felt like it was overdone. This is just a matter of personal preference though.All in all, I'm glad that a book like this exists, but I would hesitate to say that all young LGBT+/questioning people will feel like this book is applicable to them.

I think it's worth bearing in mind that this book was also written in 2014, and while none of the identities that I mentioned are new, we have a better understanding and awareness of them nowadays. Even in relation to trans people, this book came out before Caitlyn Jenner did (again, Caitlyn Jenner certainly did not invent being trans etc, but as a small-town gay myself she was only the second trans person in the public eye that I knew of after Laverne Cox).

There is very limited information for trans people, and nothing for anyone outside of the typical gender binary. It includes, in my opinion, harmful gender and sexuality stereotypes that the book itself doesn’t even seem aware that it’s perpetuating. Or states that it is a harmful stereotype, rebukes it, but then continues to use it in the explanation. Though this is the updated and revised edition, it seems to be stuck in the mid 2000s mindset that the general community has grown past many years ago. In addition, though it is clearly geared toward older teens/ young adults it mixes difficult and hurtful topics with humor more suited to 12 year olds. While I do believe this book was influential when it was first released, it is far too stuck in the past for today’s climate.

The writer explains several times that LGBT* is used to encompass all queer identities (already a VERY tall claim) and then predominantly talks of cis gay and lesbian people. This book is incredibly binary - for example the use of 'gay men and women' when gay and lesbian people would have been more inclusive and reflective. Asexuality is touched on very briefly at the beginning and for the rest of the book the author talks about sex as if its the only thing that matters to anyone. There were also one or two places where sex workers were spoken about in a less than favourable manner. Peculiar when the book is so overly sex positive and a disproportionate number of queer and trans people are sex workers. All of this is especially strange from a writer who has previously lived as a gay man and now as a trans women. I spent my time going 'tut you should know better!'Having said all of this...this book is very positive, affirming and concise.

Soprattutto in una società come la nostra in cui l’educazione sessuale è quasi un argomento tabù e a scuola non esiste se non per le due paginette sui libri di scienze (che comunque affrontano sempre la tematica della sessualità eteronormativa), questo saggio verrebbe molto utile da consigliare nelle scuole (almeno dalle medie in su). Ho apprezzato molto il modo in cui è stato pensato, l’autrice è riuscita a ricoprire molti argomenti importanti, ad affrontare tematiche spinose quali la religione e la politica, a smontare pregiudizi e simili e tanti altri argomenti che spesso non vengono considerati o sono quasi tabù (in particolare dal punto di vista della situazione italiana e la mentalità e i pregiudizi che circolano riguardo le sessualità ed identità di genere diverse da quella cis-eteronormativa accettata come “normale”).

This Book is Gay includes all sorts of information about safe sex, politics, and stereotypes for people in the LGBTQ community. The book is candid and quite funny, at times, and includes some great stories from people across the globe. I had concerns about some of the terminology, especially in regards to transgender men and women. As a cisgender, straight woman I struggled with some of the blunt word choices used in the book. For example on page two, it said “some men want to be women""; transgender men and women don't WANT to be the opposite gender, they are. Period. I also think the book focused on gay men WAY more than the rest of the LGBTQ community. In the book, James states that he is a cisgender, gay man though since the book was published James has transitioned to a transgender woman named Juno*. I found it interesting that Juno transitioned due to the commentary feeling off in the transgender section of the book. It makes me wonder what Juno was thinking and if she was struggling with her own identity while writing the book. I'd be curious to see what changes were made in the second publication under Juno's name.Show more"

The book defines Queer/genderqueer as “a refusal to define gender or sexual identity”. 🤨 There is a section on people who “don’t fit into the binary gender”, but it is rather insignificant in the context of the whole book.Additionally, trans people are mentioned throughout but outdated terms like transsexual and transvestite are used to refer to them. (I take no offense to people who identify as these; however, I feel they are from a time long gone and therefore do not use these terms to talk about trans people.)You also shouldn’t bother reading this book if you’re not out, as even though there are some helpful tips for coming out in the book, just look at the cover. It’s rainbow striped- not exactly inconspicuous. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being loud and proud, but if you’re closeted- BEWARE.I’d give it a 3.5/5.

Additionally, there is good information that could be helpful to younger/new members of the LGBTQ community that are trying to find their footing in this part of life. HOWEVER: reading this book as someone who is relatively well versed in sexuality/gender culture and politics, this book did seem to be a bit reductive concerning gender roles in the world and in relationships. It seems like this book is most helpful to someone learning how to navigate the world as a gay man, which isn’t entirely unexpected since the book is titled “This Book is Gay” and the author identified as a gay man at the time of publication. I guess not every book about sexuality has to be a massive manifesto that explores every facet of intersectionality.

There are many parts of this book with which I disagree. I do not want my 13-year-old daughter to read it, but I do want her to read it when she is much older… say maybe 16 or 17. I am, however, extremely upset about how often and widely this book is banned. My personal problem with this book is that I think it takes on too much and the author is far away not an expert on a lot of the ground he attempts to cover. He may be very right about mainstream gay male culture, but he is very much not describing any experience that I have had or any experience that I would want to have. If I had read this book around the age of 14 when I was already in a deep panic about my sexual orientation, this would have made me feel like there would be a lot of things I would have to do in order to even find a date as a gay woman that I have zero interest in doing. This would have made me panic further. Also, this book touches on religion, but not in a way that is at all helpful. Was it meant to be funny?I assume that this book is extremely helpful for young, mainstream gay or questioning men. And it definitely should not be banned. No book should be banned. Ever.Show more"

Language matters. He talks about it a number of times in the book, but some of his word choices just irk me a bit too much to let go. Some I could give a pass to but again there are a few too many examples of ableism and cissexism thrown about in an otherwise decent resource.2. On a similar note to language, he talks a lot about ideas that are positive, even relating to trans people, but aside from the basics there is little to offer non-cis gay boys/men. One positive note, which he did talk about and did try to remedy, is that his experience is that of a cis gay white man. It does show, however he accepts it by not trying to write for others - a HUGE plus in my book. He adds quotes from people of various identities in different sections and topics.

But for something that claimed to be all-inclusive of all the aspects of LGBT*... it was very heavily focused on the ""G"" portion of that; with most of the material covering ""gay cis male"" with small aspects focusing on lesbian or trans... and an even smaller portion on queer/aro/pan/bi. I think overall it's a good introduction to the topic, and makes an adequate starting point... but I would not call it a comprehensive guide on the subject. Supplementary material to help expand on what is introduced in this would be very helpful, and I kinda wish that at the end (along with the list of helpful numbers and websites) the book actually recommended some supplementary reading! There are some real positive aspects to this: it covers ""coming out"" (along with who and how to tell), relationships and STIs, and how to go about finding a support network, and there is a pervasive message throughout of ""you're you, and that's exactly who you should be, and there's nothing wrong with that"".Overall, I think the book focused so much on simplifying gender and sexuality that it actually lost a lot of what was needed along the way.Show more"

It was sometimes a little TOO simple, like things I think an adult can figure out on their own, but not everyone's journey is the same and some people can benefit from having things spelled out to them. The paper texture and cartoon art was a weird choice IMO (it looks outdated, like a Readers Digest book from 1997) and there's also some cringe language (like 'sexyfuntimes') but it's concise and mostly inclusive (although it could have been less binary and focused way more on gender nonconforming people, pansexuals asexuals and intersex people).

So many important people are missing (sorry, Harvey Fierstein!).I think the quality of the writing and the content lends itself to being targeted for young people. So much of it was so basic, skimmed the surface, or was just super cringe. I read the updated version while listening to the older version. The updated version is still outdated, but the older version is extremely outdated.

I understand that the book is didactic and simple, but it could have provided other perspectives and not remain as binary as it was. Furthermore, there were a lot of blanket statements used, such as about how everyone loves sex and how all women love vagina.Overall, I appreciate the uplifting message of the book, but I expect there are additional books out there that would provide more detailed information for people who don’t identify as cisgender gay boys and men.Show more"

Would I say don’t read it? No, it had some good info and would definitely be helpful to SOME people, however it (like most LGBTQIA+ books) tends to ignore the diverse range of identities within the community and default to either “gay” or “trans”, which, as I said, could be helpful for some people, but for a lot of the community it couldn’t.

A few of them get little more information than those definitions such as again Asexual, Aromantic and Non-binary.

There’s an entire chapter in here called “How to Argue with a Christian” 👏👏 But, as it states in the book, those who refuse to listen to reason or reality, will rarely change their mind no matter how much evidence and reasoned argument is presented to them. However, this is an incredibly hopeful book. And I don’t believe this is just for LGBTQ+ people. I believe this to be a book with knowledge everyone should possess. I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up. Show more"

A lot of funny moments, actual stories from LGBT+ people, and still managed to cover a lot of important basic topics. Is it the most in depth ""guide"" to sexuality and gender I've ever read? No. Did it talk about anything I haven't read or heard before? Not really. But I still feel like this could be a very helpful and encouraging book for younger readers or even adults who have very little knowledge of the LGBT+ community or their lives. The only reason I'm giving it 3 1/2 stars is while I think it's an amazing start to guiding young people through discovering their sexuality and encouraging them to love and empower themselves... I feel like it could have gone into a little more depth and included more stories from people who identify outside of just LGBT. BUT, like I said... if a young person questioning themselves, their sexuality, and/or gender identity.. this book may guide them to exploring other resources and giving them the reassurance that they aren't alone.Show more"

Vi darà informazioni su termini che vengono usati quotidianamente dai mass media, di cui quasi nessuno conosce realmente il significato. Vi aiuterà se volete o, dovete, affrontare un coming out. Vi mostrerà gli stereotipi legati al mondo arcobaleno. Le discriminazioni, a cui spesso devono far fronte tutti coloro che ne fanno parte. Vi darà qualche consiglio su come conoscere altre persone gay. Vi è addirittura un elenco molto dettagliato con i nomi di moltissime icone da conoscere. Ci sono moltissimi disegni di Spike Gerrel grazie al quale James Dawson mette in rassegna molti punti sopra citati, aggiungendone altri ancora, per descrivere e chiarire il mondo LGBT.

The two big issuse with the book I had were that it tried to be funny and failed, big time, and it was actually pretty exclusionary at times. This is rather strange, considering the author is trans(though identified as a gay man at the time she wrote it). There were certainly a few parts that got an eyebrow raise from me. She's also randomly judgy about things, like going to the gym.Another annoyance was that she used caps whenever she wanted to emphasize things, and THAT GETS ANNOYING. This is a BOOK. You can use ITALICS. Also you don't have to SCREAM at me every other sentence. I think it was supposed to add to the humor factor but it just come off as cheap.

The author calls attraction to the same sex “sexthoughts” which is super un-inclusive. They also only talk in binary genders, which is also super un-inclusive. They describe the term lesbian as a “women who had sex with women” which again, definitely isn’t me, and I am a lesbian?

There's also an important note that many people don't hear, which is that sexual/gender identity is more fluid than people give it credit for and labels/identities can change over time... and that's okay. We can all hear that message. Those things are really why I'm giving this book 3 stars instead of 2, which is what I would've given it otherwise.

I feel like it answered some questions I had that I didn't just want to ask the closest gay person because it's the sort of question they get asked all the time. One issue I had with it is that the casual, sort of trivializing tone seemed a little inappropriate when dealing with some of the more serious issues this book covers. Sentences like ""homophobic assaults happen way too much. Nothing to LOL at"" seems like they tried too hard to connect with young readers and not deal with a pretty somber topic right, but maybe I'm not the one to correctly provide that feedback.I think it's always a good exercise to check in with myself and question my sexuality just to make sure I'm being honest with myself, and I came away from this book even more certain that I'm straight and cis.

There were a few comments that suggested everyone wants to have sex, even though asexuality was also acknowledged elsewhere. Overall, I don’t think this is the book to base all your opinions off, but I think it’s a good book to help people feel seen, less alone, and to acknowledge both the historical and current day discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ community. It’s one authors opinion with some research plopped in, as well as lots of quotes from other LGBTQIA+ folks with different identities to make it more well rounded and representative.

I also felt that referring to the LGBT+ community as the LGB* community is a little myopic, considering the current hate trans people face, even within queer spaces. This choice seems to have been made to differentiate between discussions about sexual orientation & gender identity; however, given it was made clear early on that sexual orientation =/= gender identity, I think LGBT* could've been used consistently without being confusing. There's also no discussion of the split-attraction model, romantic identities, etc. I understand this book is kind of a jumping-off point for learning about queer identities & being queer, but at the same time, it's described as an ""instruction manual"" for people who've just realized they're queer, so despite being a very good foundational point, there are some areas where I feel it wasn't fully developed.At the end of the day though, if you take this book simply as a foundational point, I think you'll like what you read.

Being a straight ally I wanted to learn more and for younger children, this book is truly a guide that people need, it fills a void that was always missing. This book should not be banned, it should be celebrated for its efforts to get information out into the world before those individuals turn to the internet and become misinformed, leading to potentially drastic consequences. This book discusses some difficult subjects in a way that is informal and easy for a young reader to wrap their head around, the author's voice is evident and approachable and that is what I appreciated most about this read. Dawson gives the facts with proven research and it is imperative that children who need this book, have access to it, it is a beginners guide to sexual education that many schools will not address and for that it should be applauded.Show more"

I appreciate how the author included both Trans and LGB* (also together as LGBT*), but also made sure to distinguish between gender and sexual orientation. However, I noticed that the focus seemed to much more be on LGB* (particularly gay cis men), so information about and for Trans individuals (and non-binary) seemed to be just added here and there, rather than being a central piece along with sexual orientation in the book.

Though, as the name of the book suggests it is not weird to get more information related to G from LGBT. However, I would expect some content regarding different races other than white people. It is a known fact that many black gays are fetishized due to their genitals or Asian guys are fetishized as being more feminine; which in my opinion causes some problems in the community.

The book focused disproportionately on cis gay men (like so much of the discourse does) and hardly mentions bisexuals+ and only gives asexuals literally 2 sentences. Because it was published in 2014 before the gender revolution began to hit mainstream, it makes sense it doesn't acknowledge nonbinary genders and it confounds ""sex"" and ""gender"" as synonymous. They are not the same thing. For example: the book tries to debunk the myth of lesbians really wanting ""the right man"" by saying lesbians are attracted to vaginas-- just creating another myth while trying to correct the first one. Lesbians are attracted to women, and some of those women have vaginas and some don't.

A clinical study might not appeal that much to a fifteen-year-old. Some of it is very funny, especially the illustrations They are hilarious. Two of the main points are to hold your head high and that a person is more than their sexuality--we all wear many hats.It's also a good book for parents or other concerned adults who may not understand what's going on. In my case, if I have a gay character in a story I write, I don't want to write something ignorant or stereotypical. It's a pretty good guide. I didn't give it a higher rating, I guess, because it is a little too cheerleader-like for me. But, that's just me. I'm a curmudgeon. Show more"

While bisexuality is mentioned, it’s not the focus, and pansexuality and other sexual identities are glossed over. Asexuality is acknowledged in a single sentence... before the author goes onto say that every person has one thing in common: we ALL want to have sex with tons of people. If we don’t, we’re lying. And let’s not forget the constant distinctions of “men or women,” “him or her.” The T in LGBT does come into play. Non-binary people don’t exist in these pages. This book basically missed my romantic, sexual, AND gender identity. Outdated as hell. My lesbian sister liked it though, but even for someone who it may help, it still won’t be informative about the broader community.Show more"

I must say there was bits I learnt from reading it and I enjoyed the conversational style, particularly as I could hear Juno's voice saying it.I see from other reviews that certain areas (e.g. non-binary etc.) have been left out, but I think that it would have made the read much more complicated and I would say the approach taken would allow someone to start exploring and understanding themself.

There are missteps and missed opportunities on literally every page, and I found myself mentally rewriting it the entire time. I would be much less disappointed if it posited itself as a resource for cis gay men, but it claims inclusivity for the entire queer community and proceeds to ignore bi/trans/asexual/nonbinary issues at every turn. The tone and attempts at humor are cringey, dismissive, and over-simplifying. Perhaps there's just too much subject material to cover in a truly concise way, but this attempt falls far short at even being worth reading. It's not just that it has aged poorly--it was only published in 2014. We know better than this book now, but frankly, we knew better then, too.Show more"

The author does a good job of honestly addressing a lot of topics and providing solid information.As for the rating, I took off one star because 1) some of the facts did not seem quite right to me, such as the assertion that LGBT* folks are legally protected from discrimination in the US. Also I was icked out by some of the author's cisnormative language at times, such as jokes about how ""lesbians are attracted to vaginas.""

Too many lists that I would have glossed over if I had read it in print. I have several critiques, though. First, the book covers gay male topics quite well, but is a little less inclusive of lesbians and lacks substantial trans* information. (Shocking for a trans* author, even if she wasn't out at time of publication.) Aces and Aros are mere footnotes. I do not recall any other subsets of the LGBTQ+ community mentioned at any length worth reading for.The final critique is that the author stresses the importance of recognizing individuality and nuances, and avoiding stereotypes, then proceeds to contradict herself with a throwaway quip for an attempt at humour.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5269524-claire,This Book Is Gay,Rating 1 out of 5,"June 22, 2020",0,0,"Eh... here’s the thing: the author explains that she’s using “gay” in the title as a catch-all for LGBTQ+ people... and then proceeds to mostly talk bout things from the perspective of a gay cisgender man. (If you’re confused, apparently from the bio and acknowledgements at the back of the book, Juno started transitioning either while finishing the book, or after it had gone to publication) So much of this book is exclaiming that people aren’t just gay or straight, male or female... and then reinforcing the binary in the next paragraph.There are much better books out there if you need an introduction to LGBTQ+ things.

It gave some great advice and beginner information. I recommend it as an intro to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people and history (stress introduction). I want to warn people that it is pretty binary about gender. So people who are non-binary, agender, etc. and any discussion of pronouns are not included or only mentioned. Also there was a lack of mention of asexuality and/or aromance as people included in the spectrum. This book was also written in 2013 and the world has changed since then which the book does bring up. Overall, I think this book can be a great first read on LGBTness, but if you are/want to know more about the +, then you can read or skip this book as you want or find one more inclusive.Show more"

The style it was written in just wasn’t for me, but I appreciate the overall ideas and information presented. This is probably a book more geared for teens and though I read the newer edition it still failed to come across as totally inclusive with some of the language used today. Still, a useful book with some good points. We learn about sex starting around age 11, but that is only about straight sex and is very binary. We should also be teaching about gay sex and gender identity. Kids are smarter than people think and this knowledge (and this book) will not turn them gay. Show more"

I mean non binary identities aren’t even discussed in this, let alone nuances of intersectionality that greatly affect the lives of LGBT+ people.

I’m not the target audience for this book but because it’s being censored everywhere, I wanted to read (listen) it. This is a great introduction for curious teens - especially if their caregivers don’t talk openly with them about this topic. I noticed that this book heavily focuses on cis-gay men more than anything else. Asexuals and pansexuals, etc. were not discussed much or at all. My biggest takeaway as a parent was that when I taught my daughter about the “birds and the bees” and answered questions, I focused on heterosexual relationships. That was an eye opening moment for me in this book. I hope parents of younger children about to have that talk notices that and normalizes talking about it across the rainbow/alphabet spectrum.

STEREOTYPICAL one would think butch is a woman in a spiky haircut, tank top, bra less, jeans, maybe has a leather chain on her jeans, tatts, and just masculine in demeanor-sometimes mistaken for a guy. Lipstick lesbian is the more feminine woman that once she disclosed she’s into women it’s a SHOCK. Well there is another category of lesbians and that’s the in betweeners.

The cultural segments focused the likes and interests of much older, stereotypical gay men (Liza Minelli?? Why is she still a gay icon?), and I found myself cringing.

Of course there's more than one way to be trans, but AFAIK, this is how most trans people view their genders. - Doesn't talk about TERFs. I'm pretty sure they were a thing when this was written.- Frequently defines gender and attraction by genitals, eg. ""a lesbian wants a vagina, and boys you don't have one"" which is not the way it works because a. trans people exist and b. a lot of people don't base their attraction to people on their genitals.2. Talks about being LGB as being about ""sex thoughts"" about the same sex. I mean... sex is certainly a part of it for most people, but not for everyone, and I definitely wouldn't call it the defining characteristic.3.

However, I think this book is great for any person of the LGBTQ+ community to give to a family member or friend to inform them about the community. It can inform them about topics they might not know enough to explain and also takes away the possibly awkward conversation that can come from explaining certain things. Ex) the book talks a lot about sex. Being LGBTQ+, I did know a lot of what was in the book so for me it wasn't something I would purchase again for myself. However, I would definitely give it to a parent or friend who wants to know more about the community! Show more"

And then I would have been okay with a section on cutesy names of body parts - but after that - DON'T use the cutesy names in text.

I am middle-aged and straight, though I do have an adult child who is gay. As an adult, I found the breezy writing style a bit irritating after a while, and hard to take seriously. But, that's probably what would make a teen more comfortable reading it. I do think the author tries a little too hard to be funny, and it is based almost entirely on the author's opinions, with the addition of a scant few testimonials from teens and one or two other adults, no real research at all. Also, at almost 5 years old now it is a bit dated, and I think there are some cultural/language differences between the UK and the USA that can cause some confusion.I did like how a lot of basic information was presented that teens might be embarrassed to ask about, like gay sex, having babies, and emphasizing safe sex, and that there was a glossary and list of other sources of information and support. I really liked how the overall message was very positive, supportive, and affirming....basically ""you do you, and that's great!""I do think that even though the book tries to be inclusive, it is really more geared for those who are definitely male or definitely female, interested in sexual relationships, and gay. As the author states, his ""experience as a gay, white man is not representative of every gay man, let alone the thousands of gay women, bisexual men and women, and trans people...."" Non-binary genders and those who are asexual are not really addressed.Which brings my to my final issue. In the quote above, the author clearly identifies themselves as a ""gay, white man"", and is putting himself in the position of mentor and advisor to teens who are questioning their identity and orientation. Yet, as I was about to write this review, I discovered that just a year after this book was published, the author announced they were actually trans and would now live as a woman named Juno.So, I can't help but question the validity of a book written to supposedly help questionning teens figure their shit out, when clearly the author had not figured their own shit out yet, and what's worse, did not even own up to their own clearly continued questionning and/or possible fear of living openly as their true identity. Yes, some or most of the information is still useful, but there is a lack of honesty and self-awareness there that I find troubling from someone putting themselves in a position to have potentially significant influence over teens, especially when tied to the fact the author relied mostly on their own opinions rather than doing any real research.So even though the book has an eye-catching cover and a provacative title, I found it to be a big disappointment. I would imagine that in the last 4-5 years other books have been published that are better, more inclusive, more representative of current viewpoints, and more honest and forthright. Therefore, I would be very hesitant to recommend this to anyone.Show more"

There is one story, from an LGBTQ individual, about a relationship with an adult when that individual was 16.

It has a lighthearted tone, but the author still manages to add valuable tips and personal anecdotes onto nearly every page. It’s definitely a good guide for someone who doesn’t know anything about being queer/the queer community and provides comprehensive information on a variety of topics. The author also consistently quoted queer people from around the world to provide deeper insight, which I feel added a lot of value to the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they are queer, is queer, or wants to learn more. That being said, though, the book places a heavy emphasis on topics/references specific to gay men. At some points while reading, I felt like the entire book was just written for gay boys/men and the author added the other identities as an afterthought. All in all, though, I’m glad I read this book and I appreciate all of the steps the author went through to put this together.Show more"

Lettura leggerissima e altrettanto piacevole, vi ho riscontrato numerose informazioni interessanti e molta sensibilizzazione riguardo a una gran varietà di tematiche. Unica pecca: troppo poco inclusivo. Di tutte le lettere che compongono la sigla della comunità LGBTQ+ sono state approfondite, in maniera meticolosa, solo le prime quattro (ma neanche troppo per quanto riguarda i bisessuali). Lo spettro dell'attrazione romantica, così come l'identità di genere (soprattutto non binaria) non sono state minimamente toccate. Sarebbe stato apprezzato anche un accenno agli altri orientamenti sessuali (sarebbe bastato anche un glossario apposito). In sostanza, manuale di sopravvivenza adorabile, piacevole da leggere, ma con numerose lacune.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29417660-alexander-shay,This Book Is Gay,Rating 3 out of 5,"April 25, 2024",0,0,"3.5 stars rated down for tone and lack of inclusionI admittedly wasn't exactly sure what this book would cover; I just read the back after seeing a new copy come through the library and decided I'd give it a try. It is very educational for people new to the LGBT scene or who have questions, but that's about it. There isn't as much information on trans as LGB, and it's mostly from an MTF perspective. There was one FTM testimony in the whole book, maybe two. I have done some research hunting on this topic for my sociology class, so while I do know that this is partially because there just aren't as many FTM as MTF trans people out there, FTM just isn't as well represented as other categories under the rainbow banner in general, and given Dawson's penchant for equal representation of all orientations/genders, this struck me as a bit surprising.On that note, asexuality and pansexuality are mentioned only briefly in one sentence each. Most of the book focuses on how to come to terms with and come out as someone who likes your own gender. Bisexuality is sort of mentioned, but I guess it's not as scary to admit you like both genders as admitting you like the same one you are? But what about those who don't care about gender at all? Pansexuality and bisexuality are not the same thing and I think some people assume they are. There should have been at least a mini-section clarifying the difference between the two, so that people who are confused can know that bisexuality is for those who subscribe to a gender binary and pansexuality means that gender is irrelevant, which would also include intersex, trans, genderfluid, agender, etc.In addition to that, given that a decent portion of the book focused on sexual relations, as a potential asexual, I felt rather left out. The parts on meeting people and how relationships work was great, but there wasn't really anything mentioned other than 'lack of interest in sex' when it came to asexuality. A lot of people might wonder how an asexual relationship would work, or what would happen if one person was asexual and the other person wasn't. Maybe the research just isn't there, but it's yet another demographic left out of even the rainbow banner. And most shockingly, even though Dawson repeatedly mentioned, often in bold and all-caps, that you can be whoever you want to be, there was not a single mention of agender or genderfluid. The book was published in 2014 so maybe the phenomenon just wasn't very well known, but the book as a whole came across as a text that still supports the gender binary and orientation ternary, which is to say that people are men or women (even trans people, who move from one gender to the other rather than staying somewhere in the middle), and they can be straight, gay, or bisexual. I did not get the impression from this book that gender or orientation exists on a spectrum/continuation/scale as it is often represented as these days. What if someone doesn't feel like a man or woman at all? What if they don't want to be she/her OR he/him? What if sometimes they feel like a guy, sometimes like a girl, sometimes as neither, and sometimes some blend in the middle? It is probably this demographic that struggles the most in society now that, in general, LGB and even T are getting to be rather well known and with legal support behind them. I think it's really important to get resources for this group, particularly because society as a whole is still very much a binary institution and forces people into one box or the other, so people who don't feel they fit or don't want to fit into either box are kind of SOL and the anxiety and depression that can come with it might be immense. A second edition a few year from now, updated and expanded, would be a very good resource I feel. (As a side note, I rated down for tone but this is no reflection on the author himself but rather of my reading niche. This is geared towards teens instead of adults, so more ""current"" slang is used and a lighter-hearted tone in general. But it read quite silly to me and I felt more like I was being talked down at, like I must be a bit daft and needed things explained to me, with the extra important stuff made obvious by the bold and all-caps. For me personally, I just wish it would have been a little more sophisticated than it was. But I'm also not a teenager anymore, so for the actual teenage demographic, maybe it will work well.)As a second side note, this book was originally published in the UK, and as such most of the resources and things are for those who live in the UK. As someone who lives in Canada, this book is not as helpful then, obviously. There's nothing Dawson can do about that of course, and Canadian resources can be found elsewhere or even looked up on the internet. But it did make me feel a little less hopeful while reading the book, particularly in the meeting people section. You get your hopes up thinking 'I can access that too!' only to find it takes place as an event in the UK only. So it's best to read the book with a grain of salt, taking it as a springboard rather than a manual.Show more"

There is more misinformation within the book such as, LGBT people can be Muslims, which is false. Islam is very homophobic and supports the death penalty for homosexuals.
