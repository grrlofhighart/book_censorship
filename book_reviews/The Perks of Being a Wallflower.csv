I did not like this book. I am about to try to explain why that is so, here, in my own, personal review space. I am critiqing this book, based on my own opinions, personal taste, experiences and perspective, criteria and standards for literary work. It is entirely subjective, as I think all reviews, per definition, are.I mean no disrespect to the people who like this book, and who have found in it something of value. You are as entitled to your own opinion, subjective readingexperience, and standards, as I am, and yours is just as valid. And you have the same opportunity as me, to use your own review space, to clarify that. We don’t all have to agree. One opinion isn’t ‘wrong’ and the other ‘right’ – they are both right, personally speaking, because it is subjective.If you are a big fan of this book, and have difficulty in understanding or respecting people, who disagree with you, especially on issues that are important to you, I advice you not to read any further. I will not be saying nice things about this book.I want to underline that I look at Charlie as a written character, not a real person, and I critique the book as a literary piece of work, not as a real life story. To me, there is a huge difference between the two.------------------------------Some of the things that matter most to me in books are prose/writing style, storytelling and message. It’s one of the things that can make or break a book for me.In this case, the writing  style  just didn't work for me.It was just too  lacking .Maybe it's the whole premise of the book, a story narrated by someone who is emotionally inhibited as Charlie, that didn't work for me? Maybe, but it didn't have to be. That issue and Charlie’s character could have been explored and dealt with, literary, in other ways.The book could have had Charlie’s narration interact with someone else’s (like an answer to the letters for example), or it could have been written in the 3rd person, maintaining Charlie’s point of view, but also being able to draw in other views, and how they collide with Charlie’s.I find it a bit concerning, that Chbosky wrote a book with so many serious issues like suicide, death, rape, social exclusion/inclusion, relationship violence, abortion, drugs, homosexual adventures, childmolestation/incest, parties, fights, without really dealing with any one of them in depth. To have all of these issues crammed into one book, without giving it the time and place it deserves, I felt, was a huge fault. Each one of these issues needs to be taken seriously, not pointed out on one page, just to be forgotten on the next. If you are going to write about these things, write about it well, give it the space and the in-depth exploration it deserves. To make the reader care for these characters, for these issues, the author and the characters involved must care too. I had a hard time stomaching that both Chbosky and the characters seemed to care so little, for something that is so very very real and so very very difficult, for so many people. It was almost making a mockery of them, which was very off-putting to me.The staccato writing and Charlie’s detached narrating, made me feel detached as well.The story is written in a very plain, very dull, very simple language, with the same sentences reoccurring over and over (eg.  ""..I don't know why.."" , ""He/she looked sad."")The emotional description amounts to 'sad' or 'happy'.The portrayals of Charlie and everyone else in the story was so lacking that they felt like cardboard cutouts and simply came off as what they were; made up characters in a fictional story (and not a very good one at that if you ask me).The main character, Charlie, is 15, but comes off as much younger than that. Again, I would have wished for some more in-depth exploration of why and what is the basis of this, to better be able to understand and relate to Charlie’s character. Charlie also cries a lot, which wouldn’t be a problem, if it was more nuancedly described. I don’t want to see /read about just the surface tears. I want to be taken behind the tears, into the pool they stem from, the pain they are a symptom of and maybe a release from? I want the author to show me what these tears mean, I want to understand them, to be touched by them, to be moved with the ebb and flow of them. In this case, that didn’t happen. The sentence  ""I/he/she started to cry""  alone, just doesn’t stir much emotion in me. Especially not when thrown about on every other page. Then it just gets bothersome and tiring.It's not that I have an aversion to tears (my own or others'). Crying is normal, and can be very healthy and soothing. But when it comes to a literary work, I expect the author to give more nuanced descriptions of feelings than just bucketful of tears. Okay, so they are sad. Very, very sad. Very often. Now, show me what that sadness does to someone, besides producing tears, tears, tears. I am not interested in the tears alone. The sadness is the root, the tears are a symptom. Many people are filled with sadness, but don’t produce many tears. Sadness can overflow in many ways. So: the sadness is the key. Which is why I was so disappointed that Chbosky never digged deeper than this very very thin surface. All I got was tears. And I wonder if all the crying came down to Chbosky simply not knowing how else to describe emotions, or how explore them.Much thought and debate has been given to the question why Charlie is, the way he is. There is the fact that he suffered from childhood trauma, and then there is the question of whether or not Charlie might be autistic. The latter is hinted at and up for interpretation, but never explicitly stated/diagnosed.The autistic spectrum is a varied one, and it comes in many forms, very few fitting the standard, but classic ‘rainman’ syndrome of a very intelligent but socially closed off person. It’s admirable to want to write about autism, a difficult diagnosis to live with, sure. I just don’t think Chbosky is doing autistic people any favors or justice with his depiction of Charlie as someone who might or might not be autistic.Again I must say: if you are going to write about it, write about it with care. Don’t make it into a guessing game, but own it. Don’t glamorize or deride it, but show its many layers and nuances through the particulars and the concrete. The same goes for the psychological trauma. It wasn’t given the care and attention it deserved. It was left at the end as an easy way out, like 'hey, he suffered/suffers from this and so i'm excused for writing a terribly boring book'.No.Whatever made Charlie the way he is, it doesn’t compensate for how the story was written and pulled off.To me, it's really besides the point, since I don’t base my rating/review on pity for a character.SO whether Charlie has any form of autism or not, doesn't really matter, because I thought he and the story was very poorly written. and let me be clear about this: It's not the  disorder I have a problem with, it's the writing  of it.Note (November, 2013): I recently saw the movie, and thought it was better than the book.Maybe because it fixed some of the issues I had with the book, like it left some of the drama llama out and it wasn't as heavily centered on Charlie's narration and perspective, and emotions and reactions was expressed through expressions instead of just (bad) writing. Different type of media - different possibilities. For this story, i think movie worked better than writing.Show more"

Stephen Chbosky’s epistolary novel has something of a cult following, and the quotes that litter the internet seem almost anthemic, given the passion with which they are re-blogged, quoted, slapped across artfully light-leaked photographs and “liked”. A generation appears to have adopted The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and by extension it’s narrator Charlie, as a sort of symbol of the experience of adolescence. Frequently criticised and challenged, Perks seems to offer its devoted fans a sense of connection, of understanding, of honesty about things left unspoken, or whispered behind hands and closed doors. This book speaks to the sense of alienation that many teens experience, the questions of who they are and where they belong. Charlie has become a response to – and I mean no disrespect by this, as I was/am a voice in this – a collective, plaintive cry of “nobody understands me”.It also seems to have become an unofficial badge of hipsterism, and therein lies the reason for my cautious okay, biased approach to reading this book. To be blunt, I expected to dislike Perks. I know my reading tastes quite well by now and I no longer feel the need to read books based on any kind of social or intellectual cachet apparently attached to them. If anything, that just makes me more inclined to baulk at picking them up. So I confess to a little chagrin at the realisation that I don’t hate this book. I don’t even dislike it. I’ll push the boat right out and say I was rather moved by this story. While some of the issues and content in Perks may seem less groundbreaking now, more than a decade after it’s initial publication, I think it’s fair to say that they still resonate with readers. There’s been a lot of water under the bridge since 1999 in terms of “edgy” or “controversial” YA books, so it’s possible that the impact of the explicit or implied events in Chbosky’s novel are somewhat softened by comparison. Regardless, it’s still a book that successfully captures the way these topics are internalised by the protagonist, and it’s evidently a voice that continues to engage and move its more recent audience. Basically, it’s not strictly the topics that appeal, so much as the manner in which they’re approached and discussed. That said, there is a lot going on in this book, and I have to wonder whether the sheer breadth of the issues touched upon lessens the strength of the story. And not in the sense that I think the events are unrealistic, necessarily, but more that (and I offer this opinion with some trepidation) at times Perks reads like it’s a bit in love with its own moroseness. The novel’s gaze is so relentlessly self-involved that I can’t help but feel that there is something indulgent in its tone, which I was not enamoured with. Whether “wallflower” is a strictly accurate descriptor for Charlie is a topic I’ve seen expanded upon in other reviews, and I won’t go into that much here. Charlie is evidently an introvert, allegedly “gifted”, who has a rich and consuming inner world, but I think it’s clear that there is more at play here than simple shyness, intellectually and socially speaking. While some of Charlie’s emotional state is explained at the end of the novel, I feel that there’s even more to Charlie than Chbosky ever reveals, hinted at by the apparent naivety of his fifteen / sixteen years.What I did appreciate, and what ultimately caused me to like this book, was how accurately Charlie’s experiences with anxiety and depression were presented. Prior to this, I hadn’t read a book that so closely mirrored the physical and emotional manifestation of anxiety as I am familiar with it. The deeply unsettling sensation of nebulous tentacles of panic radiating out in search of something to fixate on, of instability and uncontrolled sadness, honestly made me feel nauseous. I can’t help but wish I’d had this book in my hands when I was teenager, when it probably would have meant the world to me. Anxiety is an incredibly frightening and isolating condition, and I think this book communicates that very truthfully. The sensation of being a spectator of life, rather than a participant in it, is all too relevant and close-to-home for many who have experienced a mental illness in some form. It’s probably no surprise then, that I found Chobsky’s characterisation one of the highlights of this book. From Charlie himself as the narrator, through the supporting cast, I felt that I knew who these people were, that they were real. (It actually makes me curious to see the film adaptation, and how the nuances and subtleties of the characters translate to the screen). I can’t say that I’ll be joining the ranks of dedicated, vocal fans of The Perks of a Wallflower, leaving a trail of quotes in my wake across the internet. But I am quietly appreciative of this book, and the powerful, unique experience of reading it. You can read Shirley Marr's extremely awesome take on this book here.

I decided to read this book not because there was going to be a movie coming out soon.It one of the reasons but then again it wasn’t the main one.I wanted to read it because the word “wallflower” caught my attention.I was a wallflower.I was not one of those kids people notice immediately.I was one of those people who blends in very well that I was no longer noticeable.I was a “nobody”.I was one of those uncool kids back in high school that almost no one spoke to because I always kept to myself.I was insecure.I was scared that if I try to talk no one would listen.Actually I think I still am even though I am already working.I am still a “nobody” here.I have a couple of friends but it seems like no one really knows who I really am because I never let them find out who I really was.They know my name and a couple of unimportant things but I think that’s about it.They don’t really care about the things I like, the things that make me cry, the things that make me smile.I was just another person they knew by name but never really knew at all.Perks of Being a Wallflower has to be one of the books that I could relate to.It was very insightful and poignant that in most part of this book I felt like it was me writing those letters.Charlie (the main character) and I don’t have very much in common but still I found myself relating to his situation almost all throughout the book.I was not as introverted nor was I as smart as he was but there was something about how the author wrote him that you’ll start to see the world through his eyes.You’ll see how innocent and pure his outlook was in life.Charlie wasn’t normal and he knew it.He was struggling after the death of his favorite Aunt.He tried his best to “participate” but there is still this part of him that would be locked away from everyone else.Charlie was a freshman and he still has a lot of things to learn.Hanging out with Patrick and Sam (who were both seniors) exposed him to a lot of things he wasn’t used to (like smoking, drinking, making out those sort of stuff).His letters mirrors the experience or the things we went through during his first year in high school.As I was saying earlier I loved this book a lot because I related much with not only the character but with the whole story.We may not be like Charlie but the things he went through in high school were something almost everyone went through.I didn’t do drugs nor did I smoke a lot when I was in high school.But some kids were motivated in doing so by peer pressure but in Charlie’s case I think it was more of curiosity rather than peer pressure.This book showed us how a special kid like Charlie would cope with being in high school and overcoming the problems he would encounter as he goes along.Another thing I loved about this book was how it was written.Though it was written back in the 90’s when you read it, you’ll get this impression that it was just written recently in a 90’s setting.This book was transcend time.When you read it probably in the next 10 years you would still be able to relate to it.There were a lot of good quotations in this book but one really stood out for me:So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.We are all different.We are also all the same.Most of us may not be as smart as Charlie or as popular as Brad (who I think was an a**hole) but all of us can still make a difference.We may be experiencing troubles right now but that could change based on the decisions or choices that we would make.I don’t think this is much of a review but more of a rant.Sorry my dear readers if this review disappointed you but I kind of like sharing my thoughts about a book that I really connected with.This book was one of them.I give this book 5 wonderful glittery stars!Show more"

The popularity of this book baffles me even more than the popularity of The Fault in Our Stars. Maybe I really am just a coldhearted person with no feelings.Amazingly, I actually managed to start The Perks of Being a Wallflower knowing absolutely nothing about it. I've avoided all the reviews and hype over the years, I've purposely put off seeing the movie because I wanted to check out the book first. I knew nothing except that so many people LOVE this book. I was a bit sceptical from the very first page when 15-year-old Charlie's narrative opened with short, choppy, fragmented sentences:
I don't think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle.
But I perked up at the idea of reading a book by a narrator with obvious learning difficulties. One of my favourite parts of reading is getting to see the world through the eyes of someone whose perspective I might not have fully considered before. So I was willing to overlook the slightly annoying use of immature language and structure because I realised it was needed to get inside the narrator's head. Imagine my surprise and confusion when I discovered that not only does Charlie not have any learning difficulties, but he is actually considered ""intelligent beyond his years"", is apparently extremely talented and somehow manages to get straight-A grades. What????? And also how?????It's like I'm missing something. I must be, right? Because to me this seems like nothing more than the usual melodramatic issue book, desperately trying to manipulate my emotions with the subtlety of a million flying bricks. There's suicide, sexual abuse, and domestic abuse crammed into the first few chapters. Is that not enough angst for you? Well, wait a few more chapters and we get drugs, incest, fights and first sexual experiences, told through the eyes of a guy who sounds about eight but is actually a teenager.I didn't feel sad or moved or anything so, like I said, maybe this is a character flaw on my part. But I'm tired of reading books where I can feel the author's little voice screaming between the lines ""Cry! Look people are dying and it is so sad, cry! Look incest and prejudice and rape, cry!"" I felt nothing. Except maybe manipulated; yeah, I definitely felt manipulated.Show more"

For me, the straw that broke the camel's back was when I realized that, to add to all of the above mentioned melodrama, the narrator was either emotionally or mentally handicapped. It appeared, Charlie's inability to identify any emotion within himself besides sadness, his constant crying, his lack of knowledge (at the age of 15) what masturbation was, his failure to understand any social situation (like a rape while witnessing it in his teen years) was indicative of either some form of autism or just severe mental immaturity. This, I thought then, was too exploitative. At that point, only a victim of cancer (or AIDS) was missing from this already uber-dire, emotionally manipulative narrative.But, as it turned out, I was very wrong. Charlie was, evidently, just a shy, socially awkward, AP-classes attending, extremely gifted and observant student with a dark secret. At least, that how he was described by other people. What?! What does it say about Stephen Chbosky's writing abilities if his supposedly intelligent teen narrator sounds like a 7-year old? If Charlie's writing was reflective of his speech and interactions, how in the world could he become friends with a crowd of cool older kids and even had girlfriends, all of whom thought him petty much the best thing since sliced bread? I can attribute the popularity of this novel only to the story's great variety of tear-jerking opportunities, teachable moments and life lessons, gently delivered by the ever-so-wise and deep narrator. This isn't even controversial enough to deserve all those bannings. 2 stars for moments of interest of the train-wreck kind.Show more"

From all the friends that I have made you are the one that's the most understanding. I guess what I'm trying to do is thank you for being there for me these last couple of days. I didn't expect to learn from you as much as I have. My mom always says that you can never really understand a person until you walk in their shoes, but I guess getting to know you and reading your story did just that. I have to say you have stripped me from any prejudice I might have had. And I am truly sorry if I had any. You showed me that no matter what happens, what we experience, we always have a right to feel the way we feel, just because. You showed me the purity of feelings, beauty of thoughts, generosity of love and warmth of friendship. You made me appreciate books and poetry more, and see the impact they have on people's lives. For that you will always hold a special place in my heart. I'd like to think that you get better, I hope one day you can be honest with people you love, be who you really are and do what you want to do. Most importantly I hope that you will love the real Sam and not just the idea of her and be ready for her to love you back. I hope we can see each other some day, I'll make sure to come back and remind myself of everything that is you, tho I hope to never forget.  Love always  KarolinaShow more"

MTV promoted it, it got a lot of press, so many people shun it and say it is overrated. I disagree.I didn't read this book until last year, when I turned 21. My boyfriend owned it, it seemed like a quick read, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.Main character Charlie is loveable from the first sentence out of his mouth. There are endless quoteable quotes in this book that had me folding the page over so I could write them down later. Charlie has an honest innocence to him yet such an intense depth and intelligent mind that he is quite the multifaceted character.While the story has its ups and downs, and really, there isn't a very intense plot, the reader is somehow sucked into Charlies head sharing his first kiss, his feelings toward his new friends, his feelings towards literature and music. He is naiive about so many things, and his bluntness made me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. He not only deals with issues like love, but also having a gay friend, dealing with death, and sexual assault, but also sharing his love of music and literature, which I think are two things that are being lost on youth today.I would give this book to every teenage boy and girl I knew. While Charlie isn't exactly a excellent role model, he does show that being different is O.K. and that friends come in all kinds of packages...to stay true to yourself. These things matter.

Are you effing kidding me right now?? Charlie is a freshman, a loner and an odd duck, all wrapped up in one stunningly awkward package. How awkward? Cripplingly so. 
I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.
He's always been a bit....out there...but his family knows how to handle his moods and step around his antics. 
So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
Only, he's now in high school, and the things he would get away with in middle school aren't exactly going to fly now that he's in the big leagues, and he's having difficulties adjusting.Luckily, he met Sam and and a few other friends...and with them, things are finally looking up.So. Sooooo.Sooooooooooooooo.......here's my problems with this novel - it ticks too many boxes, The Charlie Cringe and I honestly thought the novel was going a completely different direction.
This book ticks too many boxes - aka is there anything NOT covered in here?
 It feels like the author googled ""Most traumatizing teen issues"" and then, looking at the list of twenty-or-so of them, says, ""F*ck it. I'll throw them all in.""I mean, really. Does anyone expect to adequately cover suicide, mental illness, alcohol, drugs, sexual orientation, first-time-sex, incest, abuse, rape, and more in a single 200ish page novel?That's right, you can't. But you can sure as hell definitely cram all of those buzzwords into one book and throw in a few fancy-sounding quotes, like this:
We accept the love we think we deserve.
and this:
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.
And boom. Instant classic. The audience is shuffled from one BIG issue to the next BIG thing without any development.That's what frustrated me so much - we have these huge, hard-hitting issues...and nothing is dealt with. 
The Charlie Cringe -  aka holy sh*t that's a lot of crinnnnge.
And Charlie, while he is cute and adorable, his whole character just didn't feel authentic to me - the dialogue, the actions, the issues. And I'm speaking from the perspective of a wallflower - I was a quiet kid but I was NO where near Charlie-level crinnnge.Okay. You may be wondering, what level of cringe are we talking about?He's blessed by the two coolest kids in the school taking him under their wing and made him their best friend. Personally, I find that the odds that these two popular senior kids adopting the cripplingly awkward freshman to be astronomical...but hey, it's fiction. Anyway, Charlie feels like he can say anything on his mind to these seniors. And what does he tell them? Everything. And by everything, I mean EVERYTHING.For example, he confesses a sex dream about one of them 
to their face
 because he felt guilty. And they find it charming.Just. What the what?Is this really supposed to be high school? I'm just like...I may have been a wallflower, but thank GOD I wasn't 
this bad of a wallflower.

 I honestly thought the novel was going a completely different direction - aka am I the only one?
Charlie supposed to be this super smart kid, with reading comprehension off the charts (based on the English essays he writes)....but his monologue sounds like an eight-year-old with a bucket of sugar and a microphone.How can you write essay after essay on great and notable works of English that absolutely boggle the mind of your teacher...and when you pen a letter, you sound like this: 
I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning
or like this:
And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. 
Honestly, for the first 2/3 I thought he was slow or autistic and this is one of those books where everyone knows but the kid (and he finds out in some hugely traumatizing way).I mean, the signs were all there.He has emotional episodes, monologues like he's half his age and just seems so spaced out all the time.At one point, he watches a drunk girl get raped (forced to give a blow job to a much more sober guy). And by watches - he's in the same room, silently staring from a corner - doesn't intervene or do anything other than watch. AND he only realizes she got raped weeks later. How is this kid classified only as a wallflower?I really, truly thought we were going to find out that the popular kids were only nice to him because he was ""special"" - honestly, am I the only one who had these thoughts? Am I just going completely left-field on this book?Jeez. Ah well, I don't know, maybe it's just me but I'm really (really) grateful there isn't a sequel.

With the help of Sam, Patrick, and his trusty English lit teacher, Charlie tries to navigate the awkward teenage years.The Perks of Being A Wallflower is told in a collection of letters with Charlie writing to Dear Friend, someone that he has never met before but heard was a really great listener. The listening part really got to me because I have realized that most people don’t really listen. When someone sends me a letter, I read it over at least three times. I want to make sure that I’m not reading anything into it, not hearing what I want to hear. I want to understand what the other person is saying and not saying. It seems that nowadays people are really distracted with pings, dings, and notifications. The Perks of Being a Wallflower started off strongly, and it made me laugh several times. Plus, it mentioned Walden, my second favorite book, quite a few times. Always bonus points for mentioning Walden. However, this is a coming-of-age story, and this trope has been done a lot of times. The competition is fierce. The ending was unexpected and didn’t seem to fit in with the coming-of-age theme. “Cry” was mentioned 104 times! And this book isn’t even that long….As an introvert (according to an online quiz 97% introvert), I was disappointed with Charlie. Some well-intentioned person decided to coach him on some of his social skills. However, why didn’t Charlie just come out and embrace his awkwardness? Why didn’t Charlie just say, “Hey, I am always going to come up with an excuse not to go on the Team dinners”? Not everyone is going to be the life of the party, and why can’t society stop trying to turn introverts into extroverts? We aren’t extroverts-in-training! There is nothing wrong with valuing a deep relationship with one or two people rather than spending our time enduring vapid conversations with a bunch of random strangers that we probably won’t ever see again. 2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook InstaShow more"

I'm honored you think of me as a person that didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though I could have. I'm ecstatic you decided to allow me to read your thoughts. I'm glad you proved to be such a great letter-writer/story-teller. I am really quite happy about this.It was nice receiving letters from you, even though they're dated long ago. I know that I got them for only a couple of months (in a span of one year), but it felt like you've been talking to me since you were very young. (Remember that memory you called the first one you ever remembered?) I sometimes felt like the things you were pouring out in your letters were a little too personal, but you let me into your head, into your heart, into your soul. With only your words, I saw you ""participate"", I saw you have friends, I saw you fall in love, I saw you grow. I may not have ever seen you or the persons you know personally, but I could almost taste your fries from that fastfood chain, I could almost hear Mary Elizabeth's chatter, I could almost see Patrick's smile, I could almost feel the winter cold of your world there. Your friends and family were as real to me as if I saw them every single day of my life.Now... While I was glad you were very honest in your letters, I have to admit that your highs and lows were brutal and enlightening to me, as they were to you. Your first kiss (remember her tears?), your first ""girlfriend"" (e.e. cummings will always remind me of her), your first experiments with different substances (I was a little appalled, a little sad, a little curiously happy for you), your first drive (oh, the silly sophomores), your first mix tape (thank you very much for introducing me to a number of memorable songs!), your first time watching the last episode of M*A*S*H (I promise to keep that incident secret, too). You had your issues, but you seemed more interested in those of others. I felt more than a little sad when you were being too nice to some people... But boy was I rather depressed when you had to be all alone! I wish I could've always been there, instead of reading of your exploits on a date after you've had them.I'll sincerely cherish your words, your thoughts, your ideas. Thank you very much for the pop culture references - you surely made me add more books and more songs and more ""films"" to my to-check-out list!I'm a little sad that I haven't gotten any more letters from you after that last one, but I understand. I'm sure you're doing well, and rest assured: I'll always be here to hear you out when you need it.Thank you for being so wonderfully Charlie-esque. Thank you for letting me feel infinite.Love always,Your friendShow more"

 Charlie might be awkward at social events but is a brilliant innocent person with excellent thinking capacity. Nobody can blame you if you feel deja vu when you read his letters. It is that much relatable to our lives. The author beautifully depicts how he explores everything in his life for the first time through the friendship of Patrick and Sam. The author realistically portrays the difficulties and curiosities of a young adult's life.
What I learned from this book 

1) How can we take charge of our life during difficult circumstances? 
We can never fully safeguard our life from negative experiences. We inevitably have to go through some negative experiences in our life. But we can control how we react to it. If we are able to react judiciously, our life will never go off track during trying circumstances.  ""So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.""  
2) What is the greatest gift you can give your loved ones? 
Presence is the biggest present that you can give your loved ones. When there is a person to just sit near you and make you feel they are with you no matter whatever happens in your life and willing to hear you patiently, you should consider yourself the luckiest person.  “We didn't talk about anything heavy or light. We were just there together. And that was enough.""  
3) Why do people want to be in a relationship when they are single and want to be single when they are in a relationship? 
I think the best state a human being can achieve in their life is to be attached to an individual in a relationship and feel free and independent at the same time. In simpler terms, we should have a relationship without compromising the identities and individuality of both individuals. It is a complex state that only true soulmates can achieve.When the relationship is not in an ideal state, as I mentioned above, singles might feel life boring due to the lack of attachment, and couples will find life boring due to the loss of individuality. ""If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it, too. I want them to be able to do whatever they want around me.""  
My favourite three lines from this book 
 “Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.""   “I would die for you. But I won't live for you.”    ""I just want you to know that you're very special… and the only reason I'm telling you is that I don't know if anyone else ever has.""   
What could have been better?
There are a lot of trigger warnings in this book, like sexual abuse, domestic abuse, incest, and drug abuse. Some readers might find it difficult to read these parts of this book.
Rating 
 4/5 This is one of the best coming-of-age books I have read. If you liked the book Catcher in the rye, you should definitely try this book.Show more"

After 150 pages I would have needed a drink to handle all that fucking CRYING and talking and the total LACK of any attempt to actually DEAL with the issues piling up. No, three pages of so-called teenage philosophy isn't enough. In the end I'm just pissed off by the plain MANIPULATION that is this book and by the way the last issue is taken care of - FUCK YOU, BOOK. No, really. Fuck you. I am very sorry for all the people on Earth who loved this book, and know that this review isn't about you. I started The Perks of Being a Wallflower expecting to love it. As it is, I cannot. Probably because it contains what I hate the most in Literature, this being : - The blatant use of manufactured drama trying to force me to feel things. It doesn't work like that. You do NOT involve a reader by creating an unrealistic overkill of serious issues, as if they were trying to outbid each other. There's a moment when I just don't care anymore. This is manipulative and disrespectful. It reads like a catalogue of the worst situations possible. - The fact that the sub-mentioned issues aren't given the time of a day and are just there. Nope. And because I know that people will tell me that it's realistic because Charlie is only 15, and that he can't analyze these issues in depth : yes, he cannot. THAT IS THE POINT. Why include so many issues - teen pregnancy, drinking, drugs, sexual identity, abuse, and so on - if they're only there to fill the book? WHY? I am the first to admit that we mustn't take teenagers for fools and that YA novels should picture these issues. But COME. ON. What is even the point if they're only brushed off? Is telling them that it happens to other people is going to make them feel better? Is telling them that we can ignore problems because everything is going to get better anyway (because fairies, I guess) A GOOD THING? I don't think so. And yes, when something like abuse is dealt in TWO pages, I do get the feeling that the book is telling me to move the fuck on. Also, that ""beautiful"" sentence, ""we accept the love we think we deserve""? When applied to the situation? Charlie's sister being hit by her boyfriend Please don't.** I am not thick, of course I understand what this sentence is trying to say... But again, empty words. I would have probably loved it as a 14 years old. Now I'm just like, AND THEN WHAT?- Repetitive and choppy sentences all the way through, with a main character who can't decide if he's 10 or 40 or, I don't know, 5. I HATED the writing, I really did. - Characters who don't feel like teenagers at all - mainly Sam and Patrick, the super hipsters philosophers *snorts*The book be like - NOW SMILE, BITCH.► I wish I would have read another Gary D. Schmidt novel instead. Overrated.For more of my reviews, please visit:

Although he is a wallflower, Charlie is befriended by two seniors: Patrick and Sam. Patrick is secretly dating Brad, a football player, and Sam is Patrick's stepsister. Charlie quickly develops a consuming crush on Sam and subsequently admits this to her.

I always have second thoughts about ultra popular YA novels ( I haven’t forgotten my worst experience with Fault in our stars. Yes, I’m one of the haters of the book and double haters of the movie!)So as a precaution I preferred to watch its movie when it was released a few years ago( safe choice and I didn’t need to worry about the adaptation part because the author was also screenwriter and director of the movie!) And yes, the author has one of the most brilliant minds to choose the best ensemble cast ( Logan-Emma and Ezra were magnificent! ) And watching vampire Paul Rudd( the man never ages) as literature teacher Mr. Anderson tripled my enjoyment. Now I decided to read the book but of course this will be a little limited experience for me because when I start my reading I always visualize my own cast decisions and match with the characters but the author already gave me the best acting list thanks to his outstanding movie. This is kind of you hate it deeply or you love it wholeheartedly novel. Firstly you have to be open minded about the term of being wallflower. It is not easy to keep your head above the water and not to be drawn when you decide to swim at high school ocean. Being wallflower could be a decision: if you are already introvert and suffered from a tragic past, the best way to survive against the sharks is being unnoticeable, ghost, shadow! So it’s easy to connect with Charlie and respect his decision, being witnessed his remarkable change when he is befriended by Sam and Patrick. It’s a heart wrenching but also realistic story about friendship, mental health, abuse, self discovery, standing for yourself and your loved ones. Not a five star read for me but it’s still meaningful, thought provoking, heartfelt story that I mostly enjoyed.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3807932-megan,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 4 out of 5,"December 3, 2013",263 likes,0,"*UPDATE:* I went and saw the movie today and it was a very good movie. Stephen Chbosky directed the movie and it was very true to the book, I would say almost exact. So if you liked the book I would definitely recommend going to see the movie, you will enjoy it! I have been struggling with how to rate this book since I finished it. I loved this book but then at the same time it was just okay. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I am finally secure with who I am… but in high school that wasn’t true. If I would have read this book in high school I think I would be absolutely in love with it because of the fact, that probably, like most of us at one point in our teens, I felt like an outsider like Charlie. Without my closest friends around me I was a definite “wallflower,” the insecure, quite, nerd who would rather blend in then be seen. As I’m thinking about it now I think that is what was hard about this book for me at points it reminded me of who I was in middle school and the beginning of high school and that is a person I would much rather leave in the past. Sam and Patrick were the friends that pulled Charlie off the wall just as my friends did. I could relate to a lot of what Charlie felt, which I think a lot of us can. I didn’t do drugs or drink in high school but I’m sure we all had friends who did or even just know the feelings that led him too.  “ We accept the love we think we deserve,”
When I first started the book and after the suicide of Michael and the death of his aunt being carefully tiptoed around I initially thought the book was going to be mainly about suicide. In a way I guess it was but not as much as I thought. These are the parts that really spoke to me and I connected to having seen the effects of depression and suicide. After reading about the mixed tape Charlie makes I went and downloaded all the songs and I love the song  Asleep by the Smiths. I wish I had heard this song when I was dealing with everything in high school. I am glad that Stephen Chbosky introduced me to this song and the poem Charlie reads to his friends: “That's why on the back of a brown paper baghe tried another poemAnd he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""Because that's what it was really all aboutAnd he gave himself an Aand a slash on each damned wristAnd he hung it on the bathroom doorbecause this time he didn't thinkhe could reach the kitchen”
The Pros of this book: The letter writing was a unique format that felt very open and sincere. (Even though I still want to know who he was writing to and what that person thought as they received the letters.) The events in the book seemed real as if they happened in my own high school. The characters were fantastic even if I felt Charlie was being whinny at points, but hey it’s a letter that’s probably how it would sound. The Cons: Okay the main thing that really bothered me in this book was the essays he was writing for extra work. His teacher claims that he is becoming a better writer each time. The problem I have with that is wouldn’t his letter writing get better as well? I know it isn’t in a formal setting but I expected his writing overall to get better which it didn’t. I don’t know if it is just me but the writing in the book seemed below a freshman level but that could have to do with the fact that I think that Charlie suffered from some sort of autism. Overall I’m going to give this book a solid 4 stars. The book was quite relatable but I didn’t expect the twist at the end even though it did make the rest of the book make more sense. I know have a playlist on my iPod labeled as “Charlie’s Playlist” and I’m in love with the song Asleep.  “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”
This was a powerful line that really spoke to me. I never thought as moments as “infinite” but it really is true. Those moments when you are truly happy or even on the flip side when the world is crashing down they seem infinite. I love this line. Some may hate it and think it cheesy but sometimes life needs to be cheesy and it needs to be infinite. Show more"

Hope it helps!“We are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose wherever we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.” (pg.211) Every word spoken by Charlie has touched my heart. I love how honest and deep Charlie is. He will get you thinking about the good things and what really matters in life. I am inspired whenever I read this book.Written by Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower would have to be one of the most insightful young adult novels I have read. It’s a collection of letters written by a boy who calls himself Charlie. He writes “to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn’t try to sleep with people even if they could have. (He) need(s) to know that these people exist.” (pg.2) This books talks about drugs, sex, sexuality, literature, films, music, and daily adolescent life. The main character, Charlie, a freshman in the early 1990’s, is just beginning high school like all of us. Following his meeting with Sam and Patrick, two seniors who become his best friends, Charlie begins to experience more of life. He was always more of the shy understanding type who would “use thought to not participate in life.” (pg.24)""The world of first dates and mix tapes, family dramas and new friends, the world of sex, drugs and the rocky horror picture show, when all you need is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite…"" (Back cover) When I read certain books, or certain lines I can get the chills. Not just “oh that I was so good I got the chills” but the true hair raising shiver with a small sweep of coldness, chills. That line does it for me. “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite."" (pg.39) If these lines have no affect on you, I do not recommend reading this book. It’s for the thinkers as well as the participators. It’s for the ones who enjoy simplicity and want to widen and better their point of view. Don’t take me wrong though, everyone should read it, but at their own time.This book has inspired me to try and do so much more. Charlie did and achieved so much in just his freshman year alone. I want to live a life like him. One that I can look back and be proud of, one that I can tell my kids about, of walking home from school and spending the best times with my friends. To you, right now in this classroom it may seem little and petty, but to Charlie and I, this is real. After reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I assure you that Charlie will be with you forever.Show more"

Passivity vs. Passion …
Yes Charlie ~~ I know all too well what it’s like. Charlie is an outsider ~~ a typical wallflower. He gets bullied at school and prefers taking the forty minute walk home instead of the school bus. Written in the form of letters from Charlie to an anonymous recipient, it is a compelling read. Don't let its simplicity fool you, as this book has much depth. Readers learn that Charlie has many secrets that have been entrusted to him; one in particular has caused him to become a quiet person without a voice, letting people do what they want to him. He passively witnesses a rape, has a girlfriend he doesn't really like, aids his sister in getting an abortion, takes drugs and alcohol others give him, smokes, and even lets his grieving gay friend Patrick kiss him just to make Patrick feel better. These things upset Charlie, but he internalizes them. Sam, the girl he desires from a distance, encourages Charlie to form his own opinions, speak his mind, and to show passion about his desires. Charlie himself is a mystery. He has mental problems, gets angry, sees things and then passes out and cries. Right before he started high school his best friend shot himself, but there is also another, worse reason for his problems. At school Charlie meets Patrick and Sam, both of whom are outsiders too, just cooler ones. Patrick is gay and before his stepsister Sam introduced him to ""good"" music, he was a popular kid. They introduce Charlie to all kinds of new things. Parties, drugs, Rocky Horror, Billie Holliday and rock music become new parts of Charlie's life. For the first time in his life, Patrick knows what it really means to have good friends.Charlie's immediate family is loving and supportive. Charlie's friend Patrick is gay and in a relationship that is accepted in their social circle. Homophobia is present, however--a boy is beaten by his father for being gay after he’s caught being intimate with Patrick, and Patrick is in turn beaten by his boyfriend and the football jocks at school.Aren’t we all too familiar with the set-up where the loser turns out to be the really cool, popular guy? Well, all this is true too for 
The Perks of Being a Wallflower
 but just wait and you will find so much more. This book is going to catch and surprise you every time you turn a page.In a series of letters written by Charlie and sent to an anonymous person we learn about his life, his new friends, his family and especially Charlie himself. He writes about school and his English teacher, Bill, who gives Charlie extra books to read. Charlie then writes essays about them. He would like to become a writer someday.What makes this book so special and authentic is its reality. As an adult it takes you back to when you were a teenager, as a child it shows you what lies ahead and as a teenager it inspires you. And as we all know there is no other time when finding out who you are and where you belong to is more immediate than when you are a teenager.Show more"

I mean, there's a difference between shy or wallflower, and autistic. The way he doesn't understand social norms, his thought process, his actions (and inactions in certain situations), even the awkward ways he expresses his feelings. They all point to someone who sees the world differently than the rest of us.Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm totally misreading what Chbosky was trying to portray. Or maybe Chbosky didn't even realize what he was portraying.See, I love a mildly autistic kid. I love him a whole hellava lot.So.This book touched me in my soft spot.Honestly? I'm not really sure I can give it an unprejudiced review. Hmmm. Well, the reviews are quite divided between my friends. And even though I loved it, I can see why some of them didn't. Charlie's friends?Sam & Patrick were 20somthing hipsters that do not exist in high school. No, not even seniors who've been through things are that deep, that mature, or that introspective. I'm sorry, but it doesn't happen. You may believe you or your friends were that way. But I challenge anyone who thinks that, to go back and read some of their shitty poetry or obnoxiously angsty diary entries. You thought you were waaay more mature than you really were. I swear.However, it does express how some people remember themselves.So, there's that.Some people also have a problem with all of the underage drinking, drug use, and sex. Ehhh. Ok, I get why they don't like it, but it happens.I did all of that when I was in high school.Although, once again, I wasn't quite as cool or mature about it as these guys. Anyway, if you want to pretend that nobody gets drunk til they turn 21, or gets laid till they turn 18? More power to you.However, it's not only unrealistic, but it has been unrealistic for manymany years. And teenagers (while not suave) aren't stupid. If you want to align yourself with the bury-your-head-in-the-sand groups, then I can almost guarantee they'll think you're stupid, too. So, good luck getting them to take your advice seriously!Ok, last but not least, there's quite a few complaints about how many issues these kids have to deal with. Rape, molestation, suicide, gay bashing, bullying, the list goes on. Well, let me think... No one I knew killed themselves. I guess I'm biased, but I loved this book. And I loved Charlie.I just hope my Charlie has the courage to participate in life the way this one did. Minus the LSD! Because, really, that shit can be pretty fucking awful.Show more"

Um yeah, maybe if all kids teetering on the brink of adulthood made you question if they were autistic and spent the majority of their free time reading the classics and going to therapy. Don't get me wrong. This book is good. You want to find out what the deal is with the main character for the entire book and at the end, you eventually get a pretty damn good idea. But for the love, this is not the Catcher in the Rye for the 90s. And it's just unrealistic. You find out at the end why he is so weird, but the catch-22 about this book for me is that a kid with his kind of emotional issues probably never would have been able to experience the kind of social interaction he experiences and writes about throughout the book. Bottom line, kids are mean, especially in HS, and they would have been mean to this kid if he was as odd as he portrays himself to be in the ""letters"" he writes. In the book, the big denouement is catalyzed when he finally makes out with a girl he's had a crush on the whole book. In real life, that girl never would have even spoken to him, let alone gotten to the point of making out with him. Finally, there is a whole hippie vibe to this book that reminded me of a Wonder Years episode. You'd have no idea that it was supposed to take place in the early 90s if the diary entries hadn't been dated. The lack of relevant cultural references really bothered me. Show more"

Free live sex shows but you are not allowed to tell anyone. B. Free LSD mixed in a brownie. C. Free to make out with girls who take fancy on you because you seem to be harmless. D. Free books because you are autistic hence you can finish a challenging book to read like Ayn Rand’s “The Fountainhead” in 12 days and your English teacher wants to challenge you by giving you more and more books to read. E. All of the above. F. None of the above.  I read this novel twice. The first time I read it, I was annoyed from first page to page 213 and I had no doubt that this book deserved a rating of 1: I did not like it! However, when I went through the existing ratings of my friends, most of the younger ones rated this with either a 5 or 4 and most of the older ones, either 2 or 3. I read their reviews and most of the older ones said something like “the teenagers seem to like this book.” while the younger ones said something like “I see myself in the Charlie’s character when I was his age.” So, I said maybe I should read this again, imagining that I was a 15-y/o man and see if I can relate to Charlie.That did the trick for me. Nope. When I was 15, I did not do drugs because I was still in the island as a 4th year high school student and I was sure there were no drugs in that small town. If there were, I am sure people would first prioritize buying food on the table rather than spend the money on drugs. Since we also did not have maids at home, I was busy with household chores: washing my family’s clothes every Saturday, ironing our school uniforms every Sunday, washing the dishes every evening (my older sister was in charge of cooking while my oldest brother was in charge of fetching water and the older one for washing dishes every noontime). Nor did I have sex because I was a virgin till I was on my last year in college. Nor did I have friends who made out in front of me because: A. I did not have exhibitionist friends. B. People in the island were conservative on those days so they frowned on homosexuals. I was sure they did their business in complete privacy so nothing like that came out during my time. In fact, during those years, there were only a couple of grownup men who I remember being referred to all so silently as homosexuals. But now, you go there and the homosexuals are all openly roaming the streets at daytime. C. I was a year younger than my classmates-friends and I swear I was clueless at the time they were already talking about finding their underwear wet in front when they woke up one morning or when their hair started to appear down there. In other words, I was not able to relate to Charlie but I still liked this book. Reasons: A. I dawned on me during my re-read that Charlie is actually addressing those letters to his readers, including me and he is a pure soul. Notice that despite all the sad things that happened to him during his first year in high school and even in the past, he did not bear grudges on anyone. He still see things positively and even wishes good life at all. This is in complete opposite to Holden Caulfield in J. D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye who is full of teenage angst he calls all grownups “phony”. [BTW, Chbosky in Wiki says that this novel is one of his inspirations in writing “Wallflower”. In fact, this is one of the books, Bill asks Charlie to read.]B. This reminded me of Mark Haddon’s The Curious Incident of a Dog at the Night-Time because of its take on autism. Charlie is an autistic child who gets straight A’s in all his subjects and can finish and appreciate 12 adult modern fiction books most of which have “heavy” themes: To Kill a Mockingbird, This Side of Paradise, Peter Pan, The Great Gatsby, A Separate Peace, The Catcher in the Rye, On the Road, Naked Lunch, Walden, Hamlet, The Stranger and The Fountainhead just during his first year in high school. This is intriguing considering that Charlie’s style in writing barely changed from his first letter to the last so the learning or insights that he got from the books did not influence him in anyway. He is like a medical case in autism that whatever went inside his head while reading or the events that happened in his life during that year, 1991-1992 did not affect in anyway his outlook in life. He was a pure good soul through and through.C. Chbosky’s way of mimicking the sentence construction and grammar of a 15-y/o autistic boy plus the fact that the book is thin and slim encourages the reader to take this lightly, a book that one can breeze through and just say “the teenagers seem to like this book.” Wrong. Once you close the book, you will feel that there is something in the story that you missed and you will have that impulse to read through again. Chbosky hides his message on the simple and harmless looking letters, Charlie’s innocence and the unsaid words and untold stories, e.g., What is the significance of his favorite song Asleep by The Smiths in the story? (See the lyrics of the song at the end of this review). What happened to his aunt when she was a young girl? Why did Charlie’s father slap him? What happened to Charlie in the last letter? Did Patrick “Nothing” love Charlie? Why did not Chbosky give names to Charlie’s brother and sister? [In the soon-to-be-shown, movie adaptation, there seems to be no football-player older brother but his older sister has a name: Candance.] So, with these questions in mind, I went back to the first page and re-read almost every page except the ones that I found straightforward. I will not tell you my answers to those as that would be too much of spoilers. Overall, a very intriguing read. This is the first novel of Peter Chbosky (born 1970), an American novelist, screenwriter and film director. He wrote the screenplay of 2005 film Rent and he was co-creator of 2006 CBS television series, Jericho. So, he and this work, his first, should, in my opinion, not be taken lightly. That’s my only advice to those who are still to read this book. ASLEEP by The SmithsSing me to sleep Sing me to sleep I'm tired and I I want to go to bed Sing me to sleep Sing me to sleep And then leave me alone Don't try to wake me in the morning 'Cause I will be gone Don't feel bad for me I want you to know Deep in the cell of my heart I will feel so glad to go Sing me to sleep Sing me to sleep I don't want to wake up On my own anymore Sing to me Sing to me I don't want to wake up On my own anymore Don't feel bad for me I want you to know Deep in the cell of my heart I really want to go There is another world There is a better worldWell, there must be Well, there must beWell, there must beWell, there must beWell ...Show more"

But there's something indescribable and magical about experiencing a book for the first time. I can only be grateful that I finally got to read it. Perks follows the story of Charlie, who is the most lovable character I have read since Dante from Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe- which coincidentally, is one of my favourite books. He has the best teacher ever since Miss Honey. Bill notices something special in Charlie. 
""Do you always think this much Charlie?""""Is that bad?"" I just wanted someone to tell me the truth.""Not necessarily. It's just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.""""Is that bad?""""Yes.""
Charlie of course doesn't read the writing on the wall until his fast talking friend, Patrick tells it to him straight.
""He's a wallflower."" And Bob really nodded his head. And the whole room nodded their head. And I started to feel nervous in the Bob way, but Patrick didn't let me get too nervous. He sat down next to me. ""You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.""
And that my friends, is the main perk of being a wallflower. Charlie's entire existence is just so pure. And it makes you want to hug him. I loved how he loved Sam, his other bff and love interest. In his letter about Sam, he tries to describe her photo to Dear Friend.
If you listen to the song ""Asleep"", and you think about those pretty weather days that make you remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes you've known, and you cry and the person holds you back then I think you will see the photograph.
The entire novel is in epistolary format. Written in Charlie's nearly childlike way of speaking. I loved it because it felt like he was writing to me and it reminded me that he was still just 15. The saddest thing about this book is Charlie finally confronting his demons, put there by someone he trusted not to hurt him. But still he overcomes. Charlie has more fortitude in his pinky than I do in my entire body. I have learnt so much from him. And in as much as I wish I had met him when I was 15 too, I'm still glad I could meet him when I was old enough to have a lot more insight from his story. I wish a lot of things. I wish I had friends like Sam and Patrick. I wish I had a teacher like Bill. I wish I had Charlie's way of staying quiet and understanding the world around him. I wish I had money. I wish many things but most of all I wish I could know what it's like to be infinite.Show more"

And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.Damn, this book was amazing. And it's not one of those books where you figure out how amazing it is at the beginning, or even through the first half. It slowly creeps up on you. Or at least is slowly crept up on me. And the more I read, the more I loved it. And now that I've read it, I can safely say that this book definitely will go on a list of my favorite books ever. And another thing I should mention is that I've been avoiding this book for a while. One of the reasons was because I thought it was over-hyped (silly me). But then, finally, we had to read this book for University, and I'm so glad that the professor choose this book. It was the first book which I had to read, that I absolutely loved. And I haven't seen the movie, so I didn't know anything about the plot. And I'm glad that that was the case.The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a coming-of-age story. But it is also so much more than that. It is a story about a boy named Charlie who just started high school. Because he felt alone and scared, he started writing letters to... well to whoever is reading this book. At the beginning, I didn't quite like Charlie as a character. He cried way too much, and was a bit weird. But as the book went, I started liking him more and more. I also stared understanding him, and actually relating to him. Also, I liked most of the other characters (some more, some less). Yeah, they all had some flaws, and they all did some things which I sometimes didn't understand why, but we all act like that sometimes. One more thing that I absolutely loved was the friendship between Charlie, Sam and Patrick. I really wish I had a friendship like they did, in my own high school. It would certainly made things easier. I also loved that this book felt so nostalgic. Even though I finished high school not that long ago, it still brought me back to days when I just started school. And I loved that it did. So many times I've read a quote that described perfectly how I felt back then (or sometimes even now), which I couldn't find words to describe. But Charlie described it perfectly.Now, I should probably stop here and end this review, before I get too emotional. So in conclusion, I loved this book, and I can't say how much I'm glad that I've finally read it. And I'm sure that I'll re-read it many times in the future.Show more"

The book, however, was not.I love the word ""Wallflower"" There is just something about it that I like, apart from the fact that I used to actually be a Wallflower, way back in those days when I attended school. I kind of fluttered about hoping that nobody noticed me, just quietly learning, soaking up information like a sponge, and just attempting to get on in life. I worried about my appearance, my weight, and I was definitely concerned that if I spoke that my voice would not be heard. Well, those days are long gone, and I found my voice as soon as I left school, and I've not once looked back. I think that partly, is why this book spoke to me. I found it relatable.I love that the book was set out in letter format. For me, that made the book more poignant. I think Charlie, the main character, was excellent. I am as introverted as he is, but possibly not as academically gifted. The character development in this story was excellent. I felt emotion for the different characters, and the problems that they were facing and going through, especially Charlie. The one character I disliked was Brad. He was a dick. The fact that this book centres around mental health too, I think is tremendously important, and that is why I think more people should read it. There has forever been a stigma with mental health, not as bad as it was years ago but nevertheless, it evidently still exists. Mental health issues don't just disappear with some medication, or with the click of your fingers. It takes time, support and adjustment, and the majority of the time, it is difficult to overcome. I think that I could read this book in ten years time, and still have the same appreciation for it that I do now. Thank you Stephen Chbosky, I really, REALLY needed that.Show more"

Lo que sí quiero decir es que tenía cero expectativas, creyendo que sería una historia más del montón y me equivoqué, porque justo ahora es una de mis favoritas. Nunca se me va a olvidar lo mucho que me hizo sentir, es más, hasta comienzo a extrañar leer las cartas del protagonista. No sé si leí esta novela en el momento en que estaba más sensible o qué pero cuando conocí a Charlie desde el momento uno y descubrí lo solo que se sentía y lo demasiado buena persona que era me tuvo casi siempre con las lágrimas a punto de desbordarse. Y así fue en muchos trozos de sus palabras, el hormigueo y el ardor; mi vista nublada por el lagrimeo constante no podía desaparecer. Cuando leía sus cartas me emocionaba hasta la médula y leía con ansias, queriendo saber más sobre sus amigos y familiares pero también sobre él mismo, porque ante todo hay que entender que el formato epistolar solo nos permite conocer las historia desde su punto de vista, lo que le añade un tono intimista; ya que él se deja el alma y el corazón en las palabras que redacta con confianza mientras nos va contando lo que va sintiendo y sobrellevando todos esos meses. Por cierto, no se sabe para quien van dirigidas las cartas pero eso es lo de menos, porque le agrega más cercanía, logrando que sientas que es para ti, para mí, para absolutamente todos los lectores que se acercan a esta novela.Charlie es un adolescente que ha perdido a su amigo recientemente. Él no entiende nada pero no juzga, no señala ni menosprecia sus actos. Al contrario, cuando luego tiene la oportunidad de conocer a Sam y Patrick, dos hermanastros que se convertirán en sus amigos puede uno descubrir que Charlie tiene una de las mayores virtudes: escuchar. Y no solo se limita a eso, sino que es atento, amable y muy comprensivo. No hace juicios de valor negativos y eso justo lo convierte en un ser humano de lo más empático con los sentimientos de las personas que lo rodean. De verdad que el autor ha logrado que yo desee tener en mi vida alguien como él.Y aunque la novela se mete en temas complejos, duros y difíciles que se sienten superficiales como las adicciones, el consentimiento, la baja autoestima, las relaciones tóxicas, abuso y dependencia emocional, la violencia intrafamiliar y doméstica, sobre lo difícil que es salir del armario, la homofobia y podría seguir mencionando otras cuantas más. Sin embargo, a lo que quiero llegar es que muchas de estas problemáticas ni siquiera las sufre directamente Charlie, ya que él solo es un espectador y oyente de lo que pasa a su alrededor. Estos temas son parte de segundas y terceras personas, de amigos, de alguien de la familia, pero no es estrictamente a él quien lo afecta. A Charlie lo que más le molesta es cargar con traumas del pasado, sobre perder gente que ama y la creciente culpabilidad que aguarda en su corazón. El cómo no sabe manejar sus emociones y sentimientos, lo que le lleva a tener un caos interior y no exteriorizar lo que le está pasando, donde en múltiples ocasiones una buena comunicación se pierde.Al final, sé que Las ventajas de ser invisible es otra historia más de un adolescente que encuentra el amor, unos amigos con los que busca pasar un buen rato y por el contrario le dejarán huellas para toda la vida. Pero lo importante y lo que la hizo especial para mí es el protagonista. Es de esas personas tan humanas que imposible no emocionarse, sentirse feliz, enojado o triste si te está confiando a ti todo por lo que ha pasado él y la gente a la que conoce y ama profundamente. Es una lectura sencilla pero que para mí no deja de tener un valor incalculable en cuanto a lo mucho que me transmitió en tan poco, dándome un final realista pero que a la misma vez se siente como un abrazo reconfortante, justo como esas historias que quieres leer cuando estás atravesando la misma etapa que los personajes dentro de la historia.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"July 2, 2018",137 likes,0,"*5 Stars* A touching and emotional portrayal of an ordinary boy finding his significance...The brilliance and beauty of this book is discreet and quiet. We have Charlie — the awkward, lovable narrator — revealing his story through a consistent flow of letters to a ""friend"". The letters are candid and based off emotion — exactly what you'd expect from a teenaged perspective. There is no specific plot design; no standard structure this story follows, In fact, at first glance, you may be inclined to believe that Charlie, with his ordinary life and underwhelming social status, is not so significant. But, you'd be mistaken.If I seem overly protective over Charlie, it's because I am. And not only for the the fictional Charlie in this story, but for every real life ""Charlie"" out there — living life in the shadows, never realizing his own significance, his own brilliance. I wasn't expecting this story to captivate me so completely, but it has.So here's a bit about Charlie:Charlie is, as the title reveals, a wallflower. He's a thinker rather than a doer. He tends to wait for the approval of others before he makes his move. He doesn't really live life, he's more of a watcher. 

I didn't know that other people thought things about me. I didn't know they looked.

You're probably wondering where his brilliance lies by now, right?Well here it is:Charlie has the unique ability to put other people's happiness before his own. He sees the good in everyone, even in those who've clearly done him wrong. He's completely selfless and entirely kind — the real ""kind"", not the showy kind.Charlie counts every kiss, every hug, and every kind word spoken to him. He relishes these moments, and never fails to recognize their worth. Even being a part of an inside joke makes him genuinely happy and appreciative. His character is young and the way he expresses himself comes across as simple. But his messages are deep and his thoughts so profound they take a moment to digest. He doesn't complain or pity himself. He has an honesty that's endearing — the kind that truly inspires. Yes, he cries a lot. And he has his reasons. He's not perfect and doesn't claim to be. In fact, he doesn't claim to be anything because he's more focused on the well being of others. This story isn't action packed or angsty. It moves slowly and gradually pulls the reader in. It uses a gentle and simple method to deliver its power — which I found magnified its effects. It boldly narrows in on a time of life that can be very complicated: our teen years. Although it may initially seem as though this story has no distinct direction, its importance subtly shows itself, if you care enough to look ... Just like Charlie. And I loved that the structure mimicked the makings of its lead hero. This author did an incredible job bringing Charlie to life by creating a universal character with whom so many can resonate, and on varying levels. This is the first time a story so seemingly simple has chilled me to the bone, and I honestly felt my eyes were opened just a little bit wider as a result. Simply beautiful!

I just want you to know that you're very special ... and the only reason I'm telling you this is that I don't know if anyone else ever has.

As far as who the recipient of Charlie's letters is: I believe it's Charlie, writing to ""himself"" ... To the person he was during those moments he blacked out; the person who did things he never would; the person who ""didn't sleep with her, even though he could have"".*Trigger warning: There are some very serious, darker issues touched upon within this plot — such as rape, abuse, and mental illness — but the story refrains from delving too deeply into these matters, focusing more on Charlie's understanding and perspective of it all. This book doesn't act as a guide on how to handle such issues, it simply passes through an emotional piece of a young boy's life*

The main character was so hard to figure out. He was supposed to be intelligent but he was so naive. I get being book smart but dumb streetwise, but it was basic social and life knowledge that he didn't get. One minute he seemed wise beyond his years and the next he acted like a child thrust into a teenage life.There were also a couple of scenes that I didn't think were believable. I almost put the book down at the rape scene. There is no way a guy and his girlfriend would go that far with a middle schooler staring at them, much more if it weren't consensual. It seemed like Chbosky was throwing in random drama just to make his novel edgy (I hate that) and was wandering aimlessly. I almost gave it up.But I kept going. Partly because it was a quick read and partly because the voice was almost amazing. It would have been a great voice had it not been so fraught with inconsistencies, had it not been so hard to figure out, and had it not made so many observations about what adults must think that didn't feel real (more like Chbosky telling us what teenagers will learn when they aren't teenagers anymore). But sometimes I enjoyed Charlie's observations, especially about how a song on a radio while you're driving can make you feel infinite. I know it's a cheesy one-liner, but it reminded me of being a teenager. He did have some great moments as a narrator.In the end, I'm glad I finished the book. The second half of the book was much better than the first, and by the end I got Charlie. Once he made a little more sense, I could appreciate his story. Plus, I liked the feeling of the epilogue, the way I felt bittersweet and nostalgic when I closed the book. I can see why it's a cult classic. I'd probably like it better if I read it a second time, and probably would have loved it had I read it as a teenager.Show more"

Someone probably should have made me read this when I was in high school, and I most likely would have reviewed it more favorably - then again, I read The Catcher in the Rye when I was fifteen and found Holden Caulfield to be utterly insufferable, so it's entirely possible that I just do not care about the struggle of the middle-class teenage white boy. Reading this as an adult, all the issues hidden in the text were glaringly obvious. I kept waiting for the English teacher to turn out to be a total creep, but instead he just keeps telling Charlie how smart he is and being the perfect high school teacher that no one actually had, ever (apparently he's played by Paul Rudd in the movie version, which should have been a tip-off that his character was going to be perfect in every way). And why are these high school kids hanging out with a guy who's already graduated? I can't decide what's sadder - that a bunch of teenagers don't realize how pathetic their older friend is, or that the guy seems to think that these teenagers (for whom he provides drugs and alcohol and a safe place to consume them) are really his friends. Also, the writing. Stephen Chbosky is either the worst writer in the world, or he's a genius who is able to perfectly capture the shitty, self-absorbed voice of the average fifteen-year-old. Considering how gifted and smart Charlie is, I would have expected his writing to be a little better, but as it is, the book was like reading my old high school diaries, and I'm still suffering from secondhand embarrassment. Thank God I deleted my Livejournal back in college. I tried very hard to sympathize with Charlie. I am aware that he has been through hell and he Has Issues, but for Christ's sake could he stop bursting into tears every five pages? Throughout the book, every time Charlie would start crying because, I don't know, the wind hit him at the wrong angle, I would stare at the pages and think, ""If you were a female character, readers would hate you. They would mock you endlessly and say you were pathetic. If you were written as a girl, no one would have any sympathy for you at all."" And that made me sad. There were brief flashes in this book, little pieces of writing, where even as a cynical twenty-five-year-old I was able to read them and understand why teenagers connect so hard with this book. Like when Charlie writes:""I wish that God or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what's wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away. And disappear. I know that's wrong because it's my responsibility, and I know that things get worse before they get better because that's what my psychiatrist says, but this is a worse that feels too big.""(quick note to all the teenagers reading this review: that feeling that Charlie is describing doesn't go away when you leave high school. Have fun!)And the book's subtle lesson struck me deeply: loving your friends and supporting them is important, but not at the expense of your own happiness. But for the most part, I read this book and could only think one thing: thank CHRIST I'm not fifteen anymore. Show more"

The prose of this book is absolutely beautiful and there were so many quotes that I loved, many of them being the famous quotes I’m sure you all know if you’ve read it. I loved that it was told through Charlie’s letters, as it made me connect to him on a much more personal level, due to it making me feel like he was speaking to me through the letters. The book also was devastating and made me emotional.

Each letter is written mostly immediately, but sometimes a few days after the events that have taking place in Charlie's life as a junior in high school. Not your average junior though, Charlie is a massive nerd and introvert who is an outlier in his school and community, albeit with a 'cool' older sister and an older brother killing it on the football field at college and previously at the high school. Using Charlie as the lens allows the reader to see the reality of the toxic masculinity, treatment of non-binary people, treatment of outliers from a true and pragmatic prospective, and found it i utterly heart rending as it is life affirming throughout!Making Charlie the lens to see this explicit and often difficult look at how young Americans, teachers, adults and the world in general looks and treats young people with mental health, gender, sexuality, familial, relationship and dealing with the past, issues is a sublime bit of innovative creativity that makes us, the consumer, really see the pain and impact of selfish and/or lack of empathy behaviours. What takes this book to another level is not only the totally individual and personal narrative voice of Charlie, but no matter how much this story can be generalised, that it is fundamentally Charlie's story, and that every individual has a personal story and personal needs. The final piece of excellence of this episodic tour de force, is how it illustrates the huge impact of doing the right thing by accepting people for who they are, if it doesn't negatively impact others or the wider community.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886144-brigid,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"December 26, 2012",97 likes,0,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsSo, I've read this twice now. The first time I read it, I think I was about 14 years old and I believe I originally gave it three stars. But after waiting a few years and reading it again, discussing it with my book group at school, and seeing the movie (which I loved), my appreciation for it has grown immensely. And I think there's a lot of things I missed out on or didn't sympathize with as much when I read it as a younger teenager. Thus, I'm bumping my rating up to 4.5 stars (and rounding it up to 5 because Goodreads doesn't allow half-ratings, hmmph). There are a lot of things I love about this book.First of all, it covers a lot of important issues without (usually) coming off as too preachy or trying to be too controversial. I say ""usually"" because there are times I feel when it gets to be a little too much. I mean, everyone's life in this book is really screwed up––and while I think addressing all these issues is important, it does feel like overkill at times and not entirely realistic. So, there are some parts that seem unnecessary to the plot. But for the most part, Chbosky handles the controversial subjects very well, and deals with them in a careful manner without hitting the reader over the head with it.Secondly, I love the writing. It's interesting how it starts out being rather mediocre and almost painful to read, but improves a lot throughout the book as Charlie learns more and more about how to write more skillfully. (Someone in my book group brought up that it was somewhat similar to Flowers for Algernon in that regard). We see a lot of growth in Charlie just in his writing style alone. And I just love how Charlie says everything, how can get across so much meaning in so few words.It's one of those books that is able to put complicated thoughts into very understandable sentences. I understand why many people feel that this book has changed their lives and/or saved them. While reading it a second time, I came to realize just how often I had those moments where I thought, ""Wow, I've always had a thought like that but I've never known how to put it into words."" As you can see below, I like a lot of quotes from this book. There are just so many little things in it that speak to me. (Random note: OH GOD I just accidentally turned off my computer but when I turned it on again this review was still here and didn't get deleted. PRAISE THE LORD.)Anyway ... back to what I was saying.So, I think that's what's the most important thing about this book. It speaks to people. And sure, there are a lot of people dislike the way this book is written or think it's unrealistic or that it's a pretentious piece of hipster crap. But, in the end, it has still changed a lot of people's lives. I don't think it has impacted me quite as much as it has a lot of other kids, but I'm just very glad that this book exists because I think a lot of suffering teenagers can find themselves in it. And although I haven't gone through a lot of the horrendous things that characters suffer in this book, it's still something I found comforting to read merely as someone who has dealt with anxiety/depression. Although it's a dark book in a lot of ways, ultimately it conveys a lot of optimism that things won't always be this bad. I can't find the quote unfortunately, but there's one part about just waiting for the happy moments in life ... and when you experience them, you try to remind yourself that you will be happy again just like you are now, and how difficult that can be. I'm not saying it as well as Chbosky does, but I just think that idea is so easy to relate to––that when you're depressed, it's hard waiting for those happy moments, but they do happen. And ultimately, you're not alone and you have family and friends who can help you.I'm kind of rushing now because I have to go out of the house. But I think that about covers it anyway. Basically, I think this book does a great job portraying high school life and showing depressed teenagers that they are not alone.Show more"

As a teenager I was desperate to be seen as sad and beautiful, and I probably would have been really keen on this book.But these things - rape, suicide, abuse, depression, substance abuse - these are terrible things that happen to actual people. And it's not beautiful. It's not glamorous. It's not something that can be glossed over in a couple of pages. But in this book it is, and in a way it felt really nostalgic. And very 90s. It's not a bad book. I wasn't crazy about the writing style, or the fifteen-year old narrator who acted more like an 8 year-old and cried about everything, but it started to grow on me. It brought me back to the hazy hopelessness of highschool, and also the excitement for the future and how big and scary the world beyond it felt. I don't really know what I'm saying here.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 14, 2021",86 likes,0,"There are certain nuggets… certain lines or sentiments that I stockpile when I read.. I find them on pieces of paper towels or on the back of notebooks, I’ve stopped writing them on my arms since it grosses my husband out…. but they are still there, those little lines of self therapy that I rely on to further my mental wellness and to avoid those damn co-pays. So, I’m reading yet another YA book about a teen with issues that seem so prevalent these days, I mean, really, what teen doesn’t have issues, right? It’s amazing how saturated the market has become. I remember Judy Blume and SE Hinton and CS Lewis but not this flood of writers of the MTV generation (yes, this is a MTV book, I checked.)This is Charlie’s story, told in the first person through letters to some anonymous spiritual judge. Charlie is a freshman, an awkward one, hence the ‘wallflower’ title. He speaks and writes differently from other 15 year olds, it was his voice that made me love him and made me infuriated with him. How can someone be so naïve? He doesn’t know what masturbation or what wet dreams are? Seriously? At 15? Then… ‘Wallflower’---it’s always been one of those plain insults, someone who is too shy to participate (and Charlie does indeed attempt to ‘participate’), someone who is too bland to be worthy of noticing. In my most down of times, I admit to feeling like a wallflower. I’d blend into the scene, not meet people in the eye. I became the one that everyone unburdened themselves on. I was a great ‘listener’. Yay. So, nugget #1  “Charlie, don’t you get it? I can’t feel that. It’s sweet and everything, but it’s like you’re not even there sometimes. It’s great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when someone doesn’t need a shoulder? What if they need the arms or something like that? You can’t just sit there and put everybody’s lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can’t. You have to do things.” Where was this when I was 15? Hell, I probably wouldn’t have listened anyway. What I connected to most within this book was the relationship that Charlie had with his English teacher. I guess at a different age it would be Charlie and his friends or Charlie and his Crush or Charlie and his family, but at this point in my life, it’s Charlie and Bill. Bill sees how unique Charlie is and assigns him extra reading:  To Kill a Mockingbird, This Side of Paradise, A Separate Peace, Peter Pan, Walden, The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, The Stranger, Hamlet, On the Road, The Fountainhead. What amazing books to be able to expose someone to! I can even forgive The Fountainhead as I can remember pouring through it at fifteen. And when he gives Charlie this book, he also gives him my nugget #2.  “When he gave me the book, Bill said, “Be skeptical about this one. It’s a great book. But try to be a filter, not a sponge.”Is that how we break it out then? Filters and sponges? I thought about this, probably more than I thought about the storyline (which was okay, by the way) and I went back and filtered. As I grow older I find myself clinging to different characters—I guess that this is a sign of growth, or I hope that it is. I thing about this teacher that was so impressed with Charlie and I hope that at some point in my life, with my own children, I can introduce them to these authors. What a rush. I can’t pretend to understand what Charlie has gone through. It hurts. I want to take him into my arms, be his shoulder, protect him from remembering evil, but then I have to remember that this is just a book. That Charlie isn’t real. ----Be a filter, not a sponge.Show more"

The shy creatures of the universe, strangled in a problematic world where everything is so confusing and hard. We have all once swam in those deep waters, where the finish line is the act of growing up, and we all coped with it in different ways. Charlie is struggling with the same things we were, when in high school. The friendships, or lack of them, the crushes, the secret thoughts, the exams, the pressure, the misunderstandings with our parents, our goals, hopes and dreams, our visions of what we will become.
It is an emotional, but very realistic story, about one kid, and all the things he learns while growing up. By learning things the hard way, by listening, by watching things happen to his friends and family, by just being a wallflower.
The author has written this book in a way where Charlie is writing letters to his secret friend, telling him about his daily adventures. I loved this way, because the letters give a sense of confidentiality, of honesty, or pure thoughts with nothing to hide.Charlie is a shy guy, who has trouble making friends, socialising, and lacks a lot of common sense. To me, this game me vibes of an autistic kid, or an anxious child suffering from PTSD, which hits all the marks, but I don’t know whether or not this was the author’s purpose. It was written in 1998, so I can assume these subjects might have been taboo, as people weren’t as open minded as today.To me, Charlie was a relatable character. Even though clearly going through a lot more than just a normal kid, in this book, he copes with problems we have all coped. And the part I loved about Charlie the most is – he is honest, so brutally honest, and doesn’t try to hide things he understands or trying to understand. He sees things we don’t tend to see, and he feels things in a way I would want to feel them.
“So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I’m still trying to figure out how that could be.”
He suddenly meets a group of friends, that accept him as he is, and he can be as weird and crazy as he wants, no one bothers. These friendships – my dear reader – are something we all wish for, and some of us are so lucky to have them.I truly believe that this book is definitely something I would give to my kid to read, or to my small siblings. I wish I had read this 10 years ago, when I would relate more, and when all the high-school topics were relevant. But even now, I can still remember the exact way Charlie felt in some situations, and I wish I had read the book and acted differently on some of mine.
”Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve.”
Charlie will teach us a lot about high school little traumas, high-school crushes and true love, friendships and betrayals, seeing the family in a different way, and acting on things instead of doing nothing. With Charlie, I went back to high-school, and remembered all the good things and the bad, and I ALMOST shed a few tears for all the memories and times I will never have. Now, I raise a glass, and say cheers for all the good memories and friendships made.
“And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it’s enough. I really do because they’ve made me happy. And I’m only one person.”
Spend a little time, and pick up this book. It is a short and sweet read, and it is a book that everyone should have on their shelves.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestShow more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37553452-sierra,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"May 6, 2018",66 likes,0,"This was a quick read, and it is a book that I normally probably would have never picked up. Let's just say that I loved everything about this book and I was extremely happy that I finally decided to read it. I thought that it was adorable. I really loved how Charlie was a wallflower and he always tried to do the right thing for the people around him. Even though somethings they would cause problems but he was always there when they needed him. Charlie figured out that friends leave but that doesn't stop you from being friends with them. I loved Charlie's friendship with Patrick and Sam and how it all started when he decided to sit with them at a football game. Some quotes/parts that I really liked or loved: 1.) “So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.” 2.) “Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.” 3.) “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.” 4.) “So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.” 5.) “I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.” 6.) “I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.” 7.) “It's strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book.” 8.) “I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.” 9.) “He's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.” 10.) “And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it's enough. I really do because they've made me happy. And I'm only one person.” 11.) “It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite.” 12.) “I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.” 13.) “I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.” 14.) “It's just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can't do anything except 'be there.' I just want to make him stop hurting, but I can't. So I just follow him around whenever he wants to show me his world.” 15.) “It's great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms or something like that? You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things.” 16.) “It's like when my doctor told me the story of these two brothers whose dad was a bad alcoholic. One brother grew up to be a successful carpenter and never drank. The other brother ended up being a drinker as bad as his dad was. When they asked the first brother why he didn't drink, he said that after he saw what it did to his father, he could never bring himself to even try it. When they asked the other brother, he said that he guessed he learned how to drink on his father's knee. So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.” 17.) “It's kind of like when you look at yourself in the mirror and you say your name. And it gets to a point where none of it seems real. Well, sometimes I can do that, but I don't need an hour in front of a mirror. It just happens very fast, and things start to slip away. And I just open my eyes, and I see nothing. And then I start to breathe really hard trying to see something, but I can't. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it scares me.”This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

I always thought that I just had a big imagination, but it helped me realize that I was letting time pass me by because just like Charlie, I’m scared. I find comfort in my thoughts and fear being a part of the world. Charlie avoids feelings by reading books, over and over, any books he can. And his most recent read is always his favorite. ˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆“𝗜 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗹𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲.

The entire book is narrated through Charlie’s letters, addressed to us. It still told the story, it was clear, but it was different from what I expected. I honestly enjoyed the writing style of this book, it felt like I was being talked to and that made it realer for me. As if Charlie was a friend telling me a story.

I loved Sam too, but Patrick was the type of person you HOPE you run into. The one that literally forces you to become their friend if they see that you have none, and I love it. I liked Charlie’s sister too, even though she had her rough moments, the sibling dynamic was refreshing and realistic. Sam was Charlie’s romantic interest, although she wouldn’t let him do anything about his crush, and we find out why later in the book. ˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆“𝗜𝗳 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗯𝗼𝗱𝘆 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗲, 𝗜 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗜 𝗮𝗺.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4418048-jude,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"August 6, 2013",67 likes,0,"Dear Friend. It was hard to read this book, even after my therapist told me it would help. I mean, it did, but it also broke me. He said that I could make Charlie’s story my own, because Charlie’s story is my own. I saw the movie first, and at the movie theater I cried more than anyone else, because I connected with the story, because it made me remember – well, I already remembered, but it forced me to face my memories. The book was a different experience, because I can’t forget what happened no matter how hard I want and try, but it made me realize that it’s important to remember, that it’s important I don’t forget. Because Charlie’s story is literally my own- but my aunt didn’t die. Yeah, I know it’s weird to mention this, especially in a review, but I was in a bad place for a long time and all I wanted was someone or something to connect. This book made me connect, and maybe my story and Charie’s will help someone else. I hope it helps someone else. My review.The writing style is very unique, it is not something one can really miss. At first I would have described it as monotone, but as the story progressed I found that the writing helped a lot to tell the story and to represent Charlie – which was the main goal. They were supposed to be Charlie’s letters after all. Some parts in the book were hard to read, some were even hard to swallow, and the simple almost crude writing illustrated that. These were all sad stories. Sad characters, sad situations, but not 
just
 sad stories. I didn’t feel happy, or inspired or pumped up while reading this, on the contrary, constant sad smiles would appear in the corners of my mouth, as well as little frowns on my forehead. What I did feel was identified with many of the events that happened, and I believe this is what made the story so popular – almost everyone can feel identified with it at some level. A lot of people thought this book was highly overrated, but this review is coming from someone that has been in Charlie’s place and I can personally tell you that the book helps. I connected with Charlie’s story in so many aspects and things that really made me wish I hadn’t. In all honesty I wish nobody had to connect to them. But it helped, and I know it has helped a lot more people, and I hope it will help a lot more in the future. There were only two things I didn’t really like about the story. One, how Charlie was always crying. Not so much because he cried, but, the way it was written and placed made it annoying and awkward. Something would be happening and then a random ‘I started crying’ would appear, making the sentence and scene break. The second thing where the ""It made me sad/I felt sad"" a lot of the “sad’s” would also appear out of nowhere and they would turn a sentence awkward. Apart from those two minor details the book was good.The movie.I would say that I liked the move more than the book, but it’s hard because I don’t think they are comparable, they are just different. The movie makes me cry every time, because it always makes me feel hopeful and happy and full of possibility. It’s all in that line when Charlie says ""This one moment when you know you're not a sad story""Because that is what the whole story is about. Sam, Patrick, Charlie’s sister, his dad, his mom, his Aunt Hellen; everyone was sad and everyone had a lot going on in their lives, but they were not sad stories. The movie makes me realize that no matter what I’ve gone through in my life and how difficult things have been, I am more than just a sad story.“You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.” As cheesy as it sounds, the movie does make me feel infinite, it makes me feel hopeful. The book makes me feel sad “but a hopeful kind of sad. The kind of sad that just takes time.” I swear this is the last quote I use, but it fits. The book was a much fuller experience and a deeper insight, but it was also sadder. At the moment I have a bit of book-hangover and it will take me some time to get over it. As for technical aspects, I am in awe at the amazing job that Chbosky did at translating this book into a movie. How he wasn’t afraid of changing things and leaving things out, but still captured the essence of the story. When I was reading the book I tried to imagine that the movie didn’t exist, and how I would personally make it into a movie, and it’s really hard. How the story is told and how things are shown is very unique and I had a hard time imagining it in the big screen, but Chbosky did it, and he did it wonderfully. *Insert BIG applause for Chbosky*Now I will go watch the movie, cry with my dog, and then I’ll probably call my therapist to tell him what I’ve figure out, and all the other things I haven’t, and I hope he’ll help me. And I hope this book helps other people. I'm pretty sure this has been said a million times, but here's one more: You should read it. Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31514572-pearl-angeli,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 4 out of 5,"July 13, 2016",65 likes,0,"I've listened to this novel in audiobook and I've enjoyed every bit of it. The voice of the narrator and main character Charlie, is so lively and engaging, it actually gives the story a lot of entertainment.The story is told in Charlie's perspective in a form of series of letters to someone. It's like listening to someone read a diary-- but in a deeper and more dramatic sense. Throughout the book, Charlie conveyed everything about his life as a freshman and the inner struggles he had-- trying to fit in to everyone even though deep inside he just wanted to settle in the corner and just hide. Until he met his new friends who basically changed his life-- Patrick and Sam, his life as a wallflower became meaningful.First, I really love Charlie. I saw how his character grew and how he managed to change himself for the better. With the help of his friends, he was able to shine and get out of his shell and just live as an ordinary high school guy. What I also love about him is his amazing intellectuality. A 15 year old guy with such deep and sensible thoughts? I'm really awed. There were (a lot of) times when he also tested my heart's vulnerability and totally made me teary-eyed. His story is hard to explain because it's too emotional and it screams painful reality about the imperfections of life, family, friendships, and relationships. 
“What about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms?”
I also admire Sam and Patrick. They are one of the best side-kick characters I've met in a book. They are perfectly flawed but they make the greatest friends ever! I really love how they give meaning to Charlie's life and how they made everything light and easy for him.
“And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”
 I cannot express more about my feelings toward this book. It's too good and realistic. A moving and incomparable story that teenagers and even adults can relate to. This book will not be easily forgotten, for sure.
""We accept the love we think we deserve.""
 Rating: 4 Stars ------- THE MOVIE --------I've watched the movie right after listening to the audiobook and I was really hooked. I love the casting and I love how everything was delivered well. It wasn't like any other film adoptations that seemed to be hurried. The film was neatly done and all the important parts and dialogues from the book was shown on screen. I also think that the soundtracks are amazing. (My favorite was Don't Dream It's Over by Crowded House).Aaahhh so many feels after watching the film! I could not find any flaw in it because it's one of the best film adaptations I've watched in my entire life. So if you haven't watched the film yet, go watch it now. But make sure you read the book first. ;)Show more"

Everybody says so.Still a 5* review from me. This book was funny, cringey, and heart-wrenching. Through this book we are introduced to Charlie, who is writing intimate letters to an unknown person about his day, his feelings, his thoughts, etc. Charlie is a ""wallflower"" , someone who doesn't realise his own significance, his quietness acting like a cocoon, an observer but not a participant to the outside world. He see things and goes unnoticed. He is introspective, intelligent and socially awkward. ""You see things You keep quiet about them and you understand."" Charlie tries to put everybody else's happiness before his own, which sometimes means he does not achieve or get what he wants. He is entirely selfless and kind to everyone he comes across- even if he finds he clashes with them- he'll try not to hurt their feelings. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just be aware that you do not exist.Charlie is young and is attempting his best to navigate around uncharted territory. He is introduced to; mix-tapes, dances, first kisses, dates, The Rocky Horror Show, the world of sex and drugs. However, through these moments, he is also an over-thinker and cries a lot, but not without reason.Charlie was such an amazing character and one that I truly cherish. This is a character to whom so many people can resonate with, altering on different levels. This story does touch upon mental illness, rape and abuse but does not delve deeply into these matters- the author focuses on how Charlie perceives this and his emotions.The author describes a whole host of secondary characters and they are painted with their own flaws and positive attributes in a very realistic way. While the writing in this is simple (it is told from the perspective of a 15 year old boy) it leaves such a massive impact on the reader. Charlie's perspectives and thoughts often have a deeper meaning that you are glued to the page. The writing in this book ant the emotional response it achieves is stunning. This is a book I wish I had picked up when I was 14 instead of 22 as I think it would have helped me out a lot. I can understand why some people say this book ""saved"" them, it's absolutely moving and can really resonate with the personal experiences for some people (myself included).Show more"

And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be."" I know that I'm about 15 years late reading this, but I finally got around to reading The Perks Of Being A Wallflower. I made the mistake of watching the movie first, back in 2012, but I always figured I'd eventually get around to reading it once I started to forget specific details about the movie. To be honest, I didn't like this book as much as I was expecting to, but I think that's mainly due to the fact that a lot of people consider this their favorite YA book of all time, and everyone praises this book non-stop, so maybe I was expecting more. The greatest thing about this book are the quotes. This is probably one of the most quotable books I have ever read and I will probably fill this review with so many quotes. I tabbed the hell out of this book while reading it. I thought at times Charlie was a little immature, but I guess he is only 15 so I'm not really sure what to expect. Sam and Patrick were great side characters, and really amazing friends to Charlie. I think it's so important to have people like that in your life. ""You see things. You keep quiet about them. You understand. You're a wallflower.""I have always considered myself to be a ""wallflower"", which is probably why I enjoyed this book as much as I did. Throughout high school I was always a loner, I didn't really have any friends. Freshman year of high school was one of the hardest years of my life due to the fact that I felt completely alone, and this made me feel really nostalgic for that time. This book got to be very depressing at times and it was really hard to read because it took me back to the times in high school where I was really depressed. I felt a lot of the same loneliness and hopelessness that Charlie feels throughout the book. I haven't felt like that in a long time, so at times this book was difficult to read. This book deals with a lot of strong subject matter; rape, abuse, molestation, sex, suicide, and depression in general. ""I don't know if you've ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for ten thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that."" The scary thing is I actually do know what he means. I used to feel that way all the time. Sometimes I still do. I relate so much to when he talks about seeing a couple and if you feel happy for them, it's good because it means you're happy too. If it makes you sad to see other couples, it's not because you're jealous, or you want them to be unhappy, but because you crave that same kind of happiness that is missing from your life. I just understand the things that Charlie goes through in this book. He was an extremely relatable character and this brought back so many not so great memories about high school, and things I absolutely hated about high school (especially freshman year).""Have you ever done that? You feel really bad, and then it goes away, and you don't know why. I try to remind myself when I feel great like this that there will be another terrible week coming someday, so I should store up as many great details as I can, so during the next terrible week, I can remember those details and believe that I'll feel great again.I think the reason why this book became so popular was because this book was the first of its kind. Now-a-days, it is not unusual to see these intense themes like rape, molestation, depression, and suicide in YA books. In fact, it's almost common. But back in 1999 when this book was published, I really do believe this book was pushing the limits and boundaries of Young Adult and has created something new. Reading this in 1999 would have been a completely different reading experience than reading this in 2015, because there was nothing this controversial in the 90's. Also, this book has quotes that are iconic, and connects with everyone in so many ways. One of my absolute favorites is; ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" It's just such a powerful quote and it's so true, and it still stands true 16 years later. This book will always be iconic and it will go on to become a classic, I'm sure of it. I'm happy that at the end of the day, this book does have a positive vibe. It was a long and depressing journey, but this book is definitely worth a read.""And in that moment I swear, we were infinite.""Show more"

Wasn't this book promoted by MTV? It certainly does have a commercial flakiness - especially with the plot converting well into an afternoon TV special. If it's not sex, it's the drinking or the drugs or the insecurities. Perhaps reading this book is not recommended for those who have already experienced those wonderfully turmoiled years....because for old fogies this chronicle of teenage angst leaves one yawning...or at least saying ""Oh PAH-leeze"" to the point of exhaustion.

The changes were minimal and so were the cuts. Definitely a great film even though the drug use and sex was scaled back a considerable amount. As far as the coming of age genre is concerned this book is as good as it gets. It covers all bases of growing up in America during the 1990's. It may be a bit too realistic as it's near impossible not to relate to at least one event. The cast of characters stays relatively small, which works really well in terms of caring for each and every single one. The conclusion left a lot to be desired and the film took the liberty to nudge the story in the direction I think we all wanted.

Ayer a la noche, sin embargo, lo empecé —aunque más por necesitar un descanso del libro que estoy leyendo ahora que por que realmente quisiera leerlo.Tengo que decir que en parte me sorprendió y en parte me encontré con todo lo que temía. También tengo que aclarar que no vi la película, así que todo lo que esperaba se fundaba en mis prejuicios sobre el género. Lo que me esperaba terminó siendo lo que no me gustó para nada: la típica historia base del chico o chica que se enamora de otro y ese otro no parece muy interesado en nada más que amistad, como también la absurda y constante dramatización excesiva de problemas propios (y normales) de la adolescencia. No obstante, a pesar de que esos elementos dicen presente, The Perks of Being a Wallflower se reivindica con otros: la impecable caracterización de la persona autodestructiva y la repercusión del trauma en situaciones cotidianas. No puedo hablar sobre estos temas como si a mí me hubiesen pasado, pero el retrato del personaje lo considero fiel y bien desarrollado en función de sus problemas psicológicos (que, cabe aclarar, no todos tienen un origen fundamental).Desgraciadamente tengo que volver a los aspectos negativos del libro, que son varios y no alcanzan a compensar los buenos. Quedé absolutamente desbordado por el melodrama. Jamás leí una novela con tantas personas llorando tantas veces. El autor buscó constantemente provocar una respuesta emocional del lector cuando eso mismo lo hace forzado y groseramente efectista. También la escritura me pareció en exceso infantil, con oraciones muy cortas que hacían complicado alcanzar la fluidez de lectura. En cuanto a los personajes, no pude conectar con ellos (aunque tampoco me disgustaron), en especial con Charlie, que se me hizo burdamente naïve para su edad. Por último, la cantidad de temas tan delicados que tiene este libro me resultó exagerada. Son temas demasiado sensibles como para tratarlos de una manera tan pasajera (aborto, violencia doméstica, violación, incesto, suicidio, abuso de sustancias). Como que Chbosky quiso meter todos los temas deprimentes que se le venían a la cabeza en unas pocas páginas a fin de alcanzar la antes dicha respuesta emocional, y así no funcionan las cosas.En fin. Es un libro que me hizo pasar un buen rato con muchas cuestiones mal llevadas a cabo, en mi opinión.

I have a lot of questions for this author.Charlie is a virgin-minded boy - impressionable is an understatement - who writes anonymously to an anonymous reader, ""friend"" he calls them. In his letters, Charlie relates past memories and present experiences as he undergoes a transformative journey from a ""wallflower"" to a more social creature. Welcome to Charlie's introduction to the world of boys, girls, drugs, parties, sex, abuse, more abuse and death. This was supposed to be sad and lingering.❎ I knew the whole story before I started reading this book. I've never watched the movie. I had never read a review of the book until yesterday, when I read my friend's. We started reading this book at the same time, but he finished before me and wrote a review which more or less alerted me to things I had overlooked - even if I was only about 70-something pages into the book at the time. This book is that popular and loved. I seriously knew the whole story, but that didn't affect my reading experience in a negative way at all. ▶ 

YES THIS BOOK IS THAT GREAT

What happened was I had heard bits and pieces of the story from different people at different times, and when I was reading they all came together and started building what felt like one massive wheel of Déjà vu. I already knew all the twists and turns to the story. Only this wasn't simply an impression of a memory, since I really had experienced the story through others. In many ways this story is great, 
but in all the ways that count it is not. 
I noticed the weirdness of the writing, but I just didn't question it too much initially, but it got to a certain point where I just had to pause for a moment and think: How old is this kid anyway? The blurb used the term ""freshman"". I'm not well acquainted with this term because it isn't used widely over here. But from what google said, ninth graders are referred to as freshmen. Students between ages 14 and 15 - and sometimes 16 - fall within this category. I don't know to be honest. For the first time I doubted google. And then it was revealed down the line that Charlie was actually, really fifteen. 15. I went digging for my old journals out of curiosity, the ones I had written when I was Charlie's age. The ones before and after too. Even I did not sound so bad at fifteen. And that's the truth. Admittedly, my writing was very simple and gravely lacking then - and in so many ways it still is, and that's why I consider it a fair standard to use for comparison. After reading the review I referenced earlier, the problem with the writing became a nagging fact.▶ 

POSSIBLE SCENARIOS 

1) Charlie is simply a really, really poor writer.2) There is some very wicked irony afoot here because his ""writings"" are awarded a crown of remarkability by his teacher.3) Like my friend said, Charlie suffers from a neurodevelopmental disorder. That could translate into anything from autism to autism spectrum disorders.I like option 2 best. It makes this book feel quite mischievous. No seriously, the inconsistency is foul. See this. This is a passage from an essay writing by a 12 year old girl from the book: The Mighty Miss Malone
 Once upon a time … in Gary, Indiana, lived a family of three very special, very happy and uniquely talented people. I am the fourth member of that family and much too modest to include myself in such a grandiose description of their exalted number. But many people say I am of the same ilk and for that I remain internally grateful .  My mother, Mrs. Margaret “Peggy” Sutphen Malone, was born here in Gary, Indiana. She is willowy and radiant and spell-blindingly beautiful.  My father, Mr. Roscoe Malone, was born in a village in Michigan called Flint, which is geologically located 250 miles northeast of Gary. For some reason that none of us can understand he is very proud of this. His most annoying trait is the way he uses alliteration every chance he has.
And this is our good man, Charlie's writing:
 I don't think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle. I get straight A's now like my sister and that is why they leave me alone. My mom cries a lot during TV programs. My dad works a lot and is an honest man. In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around. She liked movies, and her brother Frank made her tapes of this great music that she shared with us. But over the summer she had her braces taken off, and she got a little taller and prettier and grew breasts. 
Most of the things Charlie writes just sound crude and unpolished, over simplistic and criminally deficient. I don't have it in me to include his explanation of the phenomenon that is ""Masturbation.""It's not a joking stuff. I don't know how I didn't notice this instantly. Charlie seemed incredibly mindless and half-witted to me. And I'm sorry, I do understand that he was shy and inexperienced. But inexperience and severe mindlessness are two very different things. He hardly took decisions on his own. It was either ""I'll ask Sam"" or ""I'll ask my brother"" or ""I'll have to ask my sister."" Use your own goddamn mind. ▶ Sam is beautiful inside and outside.  They said. SHOW ME. I want to see and feel this beauty you speak of. Make me understand how, just a little bit.▶ Your love is convenient and infantile, Charlie.▶ Patrick. A character I think I could like - even love.▶ I feel bad for all the tragedies in this story, but it's not enough. Feeling bad is not enough, I want to feel human.All I know is If Charlie's character was originally written as unimpaired and not different in the sense that he had a disorder, and his writing as a result was influenced by it, then I don't know, I guess I'll just accept this for what it is, because from time to time I need a dumbed down writing that dumbs down things for me. Intellectually demanding literature can be so...demanding at times. I need rest once in a while. I don't even want to talk about everything else I detested: The characterization(the only character I came close to liking remotely was Patrick), failure in impressing on themes which ordinarily should matter in a meaningful and impactful way - it just felt too frivolous, the stupid, unnatural and incessant tear shedding throughout the story which only seemed contrived, the barrage of inconsistencies and unnaturalness. I didn't even want to talk about this book at all after I finished it. This is the first time this has happened to me. I 
hate
 the way this made me feel. It seriously had a negative effect on me. And I had to calm down to write this review, but honestly I would much rather spend my time doing any and all of these.And that is that.▶ 

THE ONLY THREE QUOTES I LIKED

 
Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve. Then, I turned around and walked to my room and closed my door and put my head under my pillow and let the quiet put things where they are supposed to be. We are infinite

I wasn’t prepared to like it as much as I did.The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky was published 20 years ago and I’m glad I finally read this!The book was very nostalgic for me since I also grew up in the early 90s. All the music and movies were a nice touch in this book. I felt like I was 16 again while listening to Depeche Mode, Nirvana and smoking too many cigarettes.I started smoking in high school, just like Charlie. I don't now and I'm glad I quit!But back to smoking, it’s just what you did back then. Along with weed, LSD, drinking and listening too music all the time.I love Charlie’s relationship with his teacher Bill. The fact that he was always pushing him to read more and doing book reports was a good outlet for him. In fact, I loved his relationships with everyone. Each person in his life was good for him in some way.I don't buy the introvert angle with Charlie. I do believe that Charlie might have had Asperger’s, a high functioning autism.He was very clueless in social situations, got emotional about most things (such as crying all the time) and did not know or even think about how to lie. He is also smart on everything even if he didn't understand why the math problems were that way!I feel like introverts still know how to navigate some social situations even if they don't necessarily enjoy it.I might be wrong but that’s my two cents on his personality.OR he was struggling with PTSD and denial about his Aunt Helen. I'm not an expert but I believe it's one or the other.Maybe both?!Looking back at my own high school days, I did believe all the drugs, drinking and sex in this book were common. In fact, it happened in my crowd and at my high school.Do I believe that Patrick and Sam were that cool and open? I would like to believe it, but they felt more like they were in their 20s. They had no problem hanging out with a freshmen and Patrick was open about being gay. This felt unbelievable to me in the book since I didn’t see it happening back in the early 90s.But most of all, I loved Charlie though! He didn’t care what you were, who you loved or what type of things you were into. He just accepted you and did not judge.Can we all be more like Charlie?!Show more"

If there is one little thing I expect from a ridiculously over-hyped book, then it is making me think about an important subject. And this book certainly did provoke several thoughts, and while not all of them were positive, at least it made itself memorable in a way not too many other books usually succeed to do.Stephen Chbosky made me uncomfortable reading his novel which has by now become a classic of the Young Adult genre despite being published only seventeen years ago, but he also made me understand the things which are going on in the protagonist's, Charlie's, head. Because puberty is nothing we can choose to go through; we all have/had to endure this process of character growth at one certain time of our life. Some have experienced a stormy time full of alcohol, smoking, drugs, sex, parties - the list can be continued boundlessly. On the other side, some have endured a quite process of coming to terms with aspects of their life like sexuality, their first love and the things they expect from their life. It is the time where many of us realize that all of us are the same, yet everyone is so different from each other. Because every person feels different emotions, everyone has experienced different situations, everyone has different friends and people influencing them.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" depicts exactly this: the disorganized thoughts storming through our minds at the age of fourteen in some cases, sixteen or seventeen in some other cases. Charlie experiences it all in this novel. He has his first cigarette. His first drugs. His first time with a girl. His first relationship. His first drink. His first kiss with a boy. And not everything that happens to him during this period is good either. The subjects which are depicted in this novel are very much realistic and portraying how such a period might be like for a teenager. The main aspect which bothered me to the edge of growing frustrated was the execution into written words.► Mainly, everyone is crying in this book. Every single moment which might potentially bear any kind of emotions is ridiculed by letting the characters break out in tears. You sometimes begin to believe there are tears rather than blood rushing through their bodies. The main characters in this book might as well have founded the Tear-Shedding Club.► Charlie is a sixteen-year-old teenager. He has the perfect grades at school, always bringing home the best results of his tests ... and yet he sounds like a ten-year-old child not knowing how to express himself. I don't know if this might symbolize a potential attribute of autism, mainly because I am not that informed about autism, but it seemed weird to me. Especially since Charlie's grades remained perfect even inspite of 'straying from the right path' and beginning to get used to drugs, alcohol and the like. Maybe he is indeed an exception from the average, but it seemed weird to me and made me question the narrative's seriousness.► In addition to this, the writing was disappointing, to say the least. Maybe it was supposed to sound the way it did as the book was narrated through the eyes of a teenager, but it felt like this was a simple-structured book written for children rather than depicting the extents of puberty. And apart from that, the dialogues were horrible to read. Due to the way the novel was written, the narrative only retold the events Charlie experienced and thus may not accurately render the dialogue, but this cannot be an excuse for conversations being portrayed unrealistically and with a weird, odd undertone.► The character growth was purely frustrating to read. Going from a shy, restrained 'underdog' to someone with a lot of friends, spending his time with drinking, smoking, taking drugs and having sex without his parents even realizing or necessarily minding, and all this with a certain naturalness attached to it simply felt unnatural, especially when taking a look at the way Charlie finds new friends in. He doesn't care for those who are in his age group; no, he rather finds friends who are two or three years older than he is. I don't know a lot about the American school system or the way teenagers behave there apart from what was transmitted to me through literature, television or radio. But here in Germany, it is certainly not that easy. Either you are popular - that means, you're probably pretty self-confident, arrogant, have a way with girls, and find pleasure in making your popularity visible for everyone else - or you aren't, which, in most cases, applies for those who are struggling to find friends, who are not as self-confident or communicative as others, and are thus more likely to become a witness of mobbing etc. You cannot simply avoid the rest of the people in your age group. Either you make yourself noticeable to them, or they will notice you, and perhaps not in the way someone would have liked it to be.► This book is 200 pages long, and it covers all the issues which might possibly be covered in one single book. Suicide, drug abuse, domestic violence, homosexuality, abortion, fights, and a lot of other things. By having the characters cry at every little instance, the author literally seems to yell at us, ""Now cry with them! You are supposed to feel the emotions, to connect with the characters! CRY!"" But the story did not move me that much. The fast pace was something I appreciated, but the way issues were covered in this book felt too rushed. This book might have been twice as long without having felt too long. In conclusion, Chbosky's novel is certainly no bad one. It covered important issues and has received a hype which can only be fondly longed for by several other authors. But to me, it turned out to be quite disappointing. Was it enjoyable? Yes, it was. I read it during the course of four hours, and I always eagerly anticipated what was happening next. But was it perfect? No, it wasn't. Because the concept a book is based on always strongly differs from the execution by the author. As a result, I have rated ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" with three not-that-good-but-not-that-bad-either stars, with a little bit of disappointment connected with it.Show more"

I found the narration to be super juvenile-sounding. I couldn't think of Charlie as a 15-year-old. He wrote like he was 10 or 11. I just couldn't imagine someone his age to be so naive about EVERYTHING. I'm a little surprised he knew what a telephone was for. I obviously know that this extreme innocence is done on purpose, but I found some of the things he didn't know to be a little much. That being said, halfway through, it really turned over a new leaf. I suddenly cared about Charlie a whole lot more, and stopped thinking that his friends were with him for charity reasons. I really liked how everything was handled, and I think people can really take some valuable things away from this novel. Overall, very good. Recommend. Quick comparison to the movie: I think I did like the movie adaptation a bit more. I think it captured the essence of this book really well while also making Charlie seem that awkward freshman age without him sounding too childish.Show more"

It made it that much interesting because I already knew about his aunt. It's a very unique book and a very genuine one. I think we've all felt all these things Charlie felt. Maybe not so magnified. But surely we've all wondered why sometimes we feel helpless and broken and unfixable and felt happiness through anything else but human interaction and other times when we felt like we don't fit in, like we don't belong anywhere. Like we were wallflowers. And maybe we are/were but like Charlie we've discovered the perks of being one.Show more"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my favorite movies. And I've wanted to read the book since and I'm glad I did not wait any longer. There isn't much of a difference between the two if you're wondering. I highly recommend both or either if you can only do one.It's fascinating how Charlie sees the world.

I am not belittling the readers who have admired the book. I respect everyone's point of view and not on GRs to fight a battle of opinions! We all perceive a text/book based on the stage of life we are in, our state-of-mind, our likings and dislikings. So this is entirely my point of view, and I respect everyone who has loved the book for what it is :) An unconventional epistolary novel, depicting the vicissitudes of life from adolescence to adulthood.It is a story about the 15-year old Charlie, a freshman at high-school. A stand-offish Charlie, addresses each letter to his anonymous friend using the greeting "" Dear Friend"" and wraps up with "" Love Always"".The recent deaths of his bosom-friend and beloved Aunt, leaves him traumatized. Skittish about entering high-school, Charlie finds peace and acceptance from English teacher Bill and befriends Patrick.Charlie is deeply enamored by Patrick's stepsister Sam. Instead of finding reasons to come out of his shell, he becomes more standoffish due to complications developing among family and friends. He keeps reading ""Catcher in the Rye"" ( again personally I am not at all a fan of this novel, and found it too depressing) to find solace.I started losing interest in the second half of the novel, till I was introduced to the turbulent episode between Charlie's sister and her abusive boyfriend.Towards the end, after the sister's episode, we get to know about Charlie's brother's Patrick's and Brad's homosexual relationship.The imminence of losing school friends soon, and rejecting the provocative moves of Sam ( reason disclosed towards the end), Charlie enters a catatonic state, when he is driven to a mental hospital by his parents. A big revelation is made then, which clarifies the audience about the reason for his mental sickness(no spoilers included). From there on, Charlie puts an end to writing letters.As the story progresses, I would have expected it to pick up a positive tenor, but it plummets downhill aggressively. I couldn't gather any perks of being a wallflower whatsoever, which forces me to give 2.5 stars.The immense popularity the book acquired , reveals the populace's herd mentality on vanity and vexation, myself included as a part of this herd :)Show more"

You will have the ~feels~ they say. People need to know that this book is dark. So dark and very overrated. This is probably the most overrated book ever, next Twilight. Please! This isn't about a wallflower! This is  about a teenager who cries a lot (like a lot! at the age of 15) and get amazed by mas**rbation (""wow!"" said Charlie)This book is for emos. For people who likes to dwell into their sadness and swim in their own tears because oh that girl doesn't like me and i listen to mixtapes and i spent my free hours planning the ways to die. Depression isn't a joke. I know that. And so is every issues that is included in this book like homosexuality, child molestation.. seriously, like all bad issues that you can think of, it's probably here. See, the problem here is Chbosky managed to start every scenario with a bad issue that this bad  bad world is aware of.. and then just leave it there. Like, WHAT? WHAT? You don't get to say ""oh this guy raped this girl and you know *shrugs* things happen""WHERE IS THE CONCLUSION? Actually, is that even what the book is about? I don't understand why mention that in the first place as if it has something to do with Charlie. When Charlie haerd that he just said ""Oh.""Oh wow, see that's so ~powerful~

   
    ""And finally he found this really amazing song about this boy, and we all got quiet.
   
  
   
    Sam tapped her hand on the steering wheel. Patrick held his hand outside the car and made air waves. And I just sat between them. After the song finished, I said something.
   
  
   
    'I feel infinite.'
   
  
   
    And Sam and Patrick looked at me like I said the greatest thing they ever heard. Because the song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way.""
   
  
 So. That is supposed to be poignant?



 Give me a break.The real issue here is just this: Aunt Helen molested Charlie and Charlie is trying to forget it (unconsciously) but the memories all rushed back when Sam started touching him. This all went down right before the epilogue. It was really a powerful chapter and the Epilogue was ugggh, hearbreaking. Yes, I did got teary eyed. My heart broke. And I want to hug this kid Charlie so bad.And then I just got mad because, THAT IS WHAT THE BOOK IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. Why put us through that dull 80% of nonsense. Please! I could just read the epilogue and understand Charlie pretty well. This book just tries so hard to be deep and emotional so some (like me) will just get tired with it.

I'm glad she made the recommendation, I am completely smitten with Charlie, in a big sister kind of way. Sadly, I think I was missing the point.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is told by Charlie, a high school freshman, via letters to ""Dear Friend"". We quickly learn that he doesn't feel the need to ""fit in""; however, it wouldn't be accurate to say that he is comfortable in his own skin. ""Wallflower"" is definitely the most apt description. Although not necessarily content with it, he generally watches life happen. When he does act, or more fairly, react, I wanted to cheer, to pat him on the back and say ""there, you see, you CAN do it"". This is not what Charlie needs to hear.Throughout the freshman year letters, there are certainly allusions to Charlie having issues--more so than the typical teen. I tried to diagnose. Depression? Too simple. Asperberger's Disorder? Yeah, probably not. I really didn't expect a revelation, and I most certainly did not expect the issue that was revealed towards the end of the book. I felt a bit guilty. I almost want to read it again now, as if under a brighter light. I won't, it would feel like cheating. I'll just say that Mr. Chbosky created a lovable character, one that spans the generations---loved equally by my 15-year old student and me (a not-so-young adult). Show more"

I just moved to the US all by myself and was about to attend American High School for a year. My life was a mess and I wanted to start anew. Nothing prepared for what I was about to experience and I did all the wrong things and went the wrong way about the whole thing. If I had only read this book back then maybe I would've gotten my priorities right. Also it is written in such a simple language that my teenage self wouldn’t struggle with it. It would give me the courage to explore more. As it was, I started reading in English with some big complicated book that made me dizzy and I eventually abandoned it. It was 2000! This book was huge then, I believe. I went to a bookshop and asked someone there to recommend me a book. I explained I came to the US, just started American High School, that I felt very lonely and that books made me happy. Why the idiot working there didn’t just give me ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’, I will never know but I hope he got sacked eventually. Mind you, I wasn’t somewhere along the Bible belt, where he might've been worried of causing scandal by giving me this book. It was New Hampshire! Live free or die! Of course, reading it now, in 2012, when I’m a seemingly well-adjusted adult living in London and not afraid of tackling even the most complex books in English, was not exactly a mind-blowing experience. I still felt the power and allure it would've had for me if I read it at a right time but could also see it for what it was – bit of a naïve coming of age story written in a language that was too simple if it was supposed to belong to Charlie - the English class prodigy. There was a lot of: “I was sad. I cried. I was happy. I cried. And then I just cried for no reason.”But you know what, there is one lesson in it that you should remember. Friends are important. And the friends you make when you’re young are usually the friends you keep for life. So choose wise.And also here is a note for half of the people on the internets: Charlie was NOT autistic. I know people tend to call ‘autistic’ anything they consider weird but Charlie was the opposite of autistic. Autism is not characterized by higher than normal appreciation of literature or being oversensitive to people’s feelings and super-perceptive when it comes to emotions. People, autism is more or less the opposite of that. If you need to give Charlie a label, make it PTSD and stop embarrassing yourselves.Show more"

He’s naïve and precocious and childish and odd and enlightening and invisible and seen and I could have tried pot brownies and would have had no idea I was stoned unless someone told me and I would have wanted a milkshake and I can’t dance but I can do the sway and I could have witnessed a rape and had no idea what had happened because I was in middle school a kid. I could have confided to my teacher about a tragic event that happened at home and I avoided beer like it was the second coming of Satan and I could have written letters to an anonymous pen pal and I did chores to earn my allowance and I wrote poems in high school college and I went out with a girl who had what could be described as low self-esteem and I was totally infatuated with her for a period of time and I like unconventionally beautiful women.

It's a story of this 'wallflower' and him writing anonymous letters to someone, and the fact that, that 'anonymous someone' is us, the readers...makes the entire reading experience so special.The narrative is as ripe and naive as of a normal teenager and all of that innocence makes Charlie absolutely cute and lovable.It's basically not something we'll consider as a purpose-driven fictional work but the story just flows...there's no such big shot plot or anything, it's simply the way it's written expressing real feelings and attitude of a teen that you just get to relate to it anyway.It's been a long time since I have been out of that YA phase but this book somehow struck a chord with me and I'm not actually surprised by that. I had this book in my TBR for the longest of time now and have always wanted to read it ever since I've been a teenager myself but it kept getting delayed and I refrained myself from watching the movie or taking part in the fandom, so that I don't get the details known but I'm so glad and relieved (both) that I was able to keep it that way all the way through these years until I finally read it.Read it at least 'once in your lifetime' kinda book!Show more"

I don’t even know what aspect of Perks makes it succeed so much. Perhaps it’s the strong character work. Every character here feels like a real person, not a character. They’re vivid, in a way it's hard for characters to be. Perhaps it’s the perfectly blended thematics. Perks manages to combine so many different themes into one incredible book, yet nothing feels forced. This book needs to be read at a certain age for the vibe to really work. Because really, it's a coming-of-age different than those you've read before. But perhaps the true power of this book is simply the emotion bleeding through the pages. There’s no way to quantify or describe the emotion I felt reading this. It’s just something you need to read for yourself. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | YoutubeShow more"

For sure a lot of people could relate in this novel especially when they remembered the first time they entered Highschool. You meet new people with different personalities. Everything in Highschool is part of growing up and we learn to make our own choices in the future. A story that involves family, love , and friendship.Charlie is a Freshman student and he is a Wallflower. He's sensitive, emotional and weird. His Aunt's death had affected him, and struggled getting along with others. Sometimes, he pretends to be someone he's not. Along the way, he met his new found friends Sam and Patrick, siblings (step siblings) and Senior students. With curiosity and peer pressure, Charlie did a lot of things like smoking, drinking etc.. He did these things with others so he could get along with them and trying to please them as possible.It's kind of annoying when he becomes dramatic. I mean, there's no reason to cry for ( Oh well, he's just emotional and weird) and I hate Craig cheating Sam, I just want to punch him. Another weird thing when he let Patrick kiss him. It's just surprising..a little awkward. Still I like Charlie in a way he learned lessons in life and tries to ""participate"" in other things.What makes this book beautiful?I can relate to it.I was a Wallflower. It's not that I'm exactly like Charlie. But I had difficulties in getting along with other people when I was in High school. I don't talk a lot and I am not popular. I tried to get along with their conversations, or I am sitting ALONG with them but it was like I'm invisible to them. Like there's a huge wall between us. Sometimes they will just call me or tag me along when they NEEDED something. It hurts to feel being left out in a group.. I must admit that I cried that time. I had a hard time expressing myself to others, afraid that I would be misinterpreted by others. I have friends but only a few knew who I really am. I have lots of sentiments. Sometimes, I just need to be alone. Not being a loner one, but simply just need time for myself where I could do anything I want. This is just one of the books that is closest to my heart. Stephen Chbosky is fantastic. Such a wonderful and moving story. There are things that I've learned in this book:Have a choice of your own. - You could get an advice from your friends, you may take it or not. It's still your decision. Be responsible for your actions- There's always a peer pressure and curiosity. Party, drinking, smoking etc.. But be responsible enough for the consequences. Learn to put your limitations and be stiff enough to balance what is right and wrong.Be Flexible.- Not all the time you meet people with the same personality. Learn to adjust with them, but not all the time. Be sociable and try to get along. Join in activities. Share your interests. Express your feelings to others .- There's nothing wrong to express your feelings. But make sure you say it in a nice and polite way, at least they will know what you are really feeling and Listen to what they are saying whether it's good or bad for sure they will appreciate that.Just Be Yourself- Never pretend to be something you are not. Just be real. You don't have to please everyone. Treasure those people who accept you for who you are. They're keepers.Favorite Quote: “I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people. Maybe that is what makes people ""participate.”  Movie:I watched it, and it was BEAUTIFUL! The actors and actresses fit their roles. It's nice to see Emma Watson outside Harry Potter world. She's awesome. As for the one who played Patrick, he's so funny! That Rocky Horror Show:)Show more"

I know kids still do smoke today but it’s more taboo with all the health issues brought to light now. Charlie is the main character of this story. He comes from a suburban type home with both parents and an older brother and sister. The story starts out with Charlie writing letters left and right to an anonymous person about things that are happening in his life. He really doesn’t have many friends, and his one close friend Michael Dobbins had committed suicide while they were in junior high. So Charlie starts out high school as a Freshman all alone, until he introduces himself to Patrick & Sam at a school football game. They are two popular High School Seniors that also happen to be step siblings. Charlie’s life changes so much from that point on. He goes from this emotional, awkward lonely kid to an emotionally awkward kid with friends. Quite a bit of friends. He’s starting to have a social life and lots of fun along the way. And all the while he continues to send updates and stories of his life to the unnamed person. Everything seems to be going very well with Charlie even though he’s still very emotional at times and still kind of awkward. That is until High School is ending for the year and Sam, Patrick and all Charlie’s friends the brother and sister duo are leaving for college. Charlie is spending alone time with Sam when something is triggered in Charlie and his whole life is altered when long suppressed events from his childhood are brought to the light. These memories change everything for Charlie and everyone that loves him.There are some books you know from the beginning you are going to love. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those stories. I fell utterly in love with this book. Charlie is such a weird wonderful character you can’t help but like him. I wanted to take him by the hand and tell him never change. It’s ok to be thoughtful and loving. It’s really beautiful that he’s just so unique. I knew there had to be some kind of childhood trauma for him to have these unexplained black out episodes and severe anger problems that were so normally out of character for Charlie. And the fact that he had to see a psychiatrist was a tip off as well. It is so sad and sickening when it finally comes to light, the trauma he endured and was burying. It angered me so much that someone he trusted could do that. I just wish it hadn’t been discovered at the very end of the book. I guess Mr. Chbosky wanted it to show that it was so traumatic that it is buried for so long. But I felt like it was brought up and then The End.Other than that phenomenal read!Show more"

I didn’t like it…AT ALL, and I couldn’t bring myself to finish it. I felt it was a waste of a clever title for such a lame storyline. The main character Charlie, in my opinion, was an unrealistic protagonist who really can’t be categorized as a wallflower in the truest sense of the word. When I think of a wallflower, social awkwardness and interactive paralysis comes to mind. I don’t think Charlie is socially awkward; he’s simply clueless and unlikeable. If I had to hear about one more event that made him cry like a baby, I would have screeched loud enough to wake up the neighbors. I’ve never read a book published by MTV books, and unfortunately, this book has lowered my opinion of them and has placed them at the lower end of the literary spectrum. What a waste of time.

Charlie's character, along with his best friends and most of his family, feel very three dimensional and real. The supporting characters add a little homour and balance (I especially like the offensive, racist grandfather because we all know an old guy like that!) I would have liked to have gained more understanding of the mental issues, because it's all a bit vague, but I also appreciate that it's from Charlie's point of view, and putting a name on it isn't the point. The entire book is written as a series of letters to an unknown 'good guy'. I'm not sure if I missed a hint somewhere or if the recipient really is anonymous. I'm dying to know who it is, but at the same time it doesn't really matter. It's just a diary that can't be found. I did have a couple of problems with it. The writing felt a little 'young' especially as Charlie's meant to be straight A student gifted in English. This may have something to do with the mental health issues involved and his teachers attempt to get Charlie to focus instead of spiralling into a stream of conciseness, but without more information it's hard to balance the writing style with what we learn about the character academically. There were also a few places where I wanted to push the story along - the story overall wasn't slow, just one or two points. But that's a minor criticism. Overall I very much enjoyed it.Show more"

This book includes trigger warning for: suicidal thoughts, rape, child molestation, bullying, self-harm, drug and alcohol abuse, unhealthy amounts of smoking, mental breakdowns.I loved the letter format and how the writing style seems to evolve as the book goes, that was a nice touch, I felt for Charlie, I was happy when people were patient with him and wanted to punch those who bullied him. He's definitely a work in progress, as none of the people here are perfect, including Charlie himself, but the way he sees and speaks of them and manages to see the good in everyone affects me and makes me want to do the same.1st read review (2015):THIS BOOK GAVE ME ALL THE FEELS!This has become one of my favorite books ... of all time!This is the kind of books I want to read when it comes to reading about high school students and the struggles they go through. This was so real and heart-wrenching, and it made me want to hug charlie so bad, and tell him everything will be okay now.This follows Charlie through his first year in high school, while he writes about his life and himself in letters to an anonymous stranger. Sometimes I feel like Charlie is too smart for his age, and other times I feel like I'm in the mind of a 10-years old. Charlie is a damaged boy, suffering from a childhood trauma, and goes through the process of trying to find somewhere he belongs.I love his relationship with his family, and Patrick and Sam, but most of all, I love how he talks about them. He's honest, shy, sensitive, introvert except with the right people, bookworm, and an over-thinker (which are all my characteristics, maybe that's why I like him a lot? in a way, he reminds me of myself).Of course, some characters weren't explored enough as Charlie and his closest fiends and family, but I don't mind that, I was so immersed in Charlie's mind, and his choices of books and music, and his thoughts and fears, to notice anyone else. I made a list of all books mentioned in this to read later, and made a playlist with all of his mix tape songs songs which I listen to all the time now. That's how much I loved him. I haven't read much about damaged teenagers or those suffering some mental issues due to some traumas they've been through, but I think this captured it just the right way.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 4 out of 5,"August 19, 2023",39 likes,2 comments,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Young Adult + Contemporary ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a coming-of-age novel that is considered a modern classic. The narrative is told in the form of letters that the main character, Charlie, writes to a friend who remains nameless throughout the story. The story delves into topics such as friendship, self-identity, the ups and downs of mental health, and the struggles of coming of age.During his first year of high school, Charlie is a reserved and introspective young man who is navigating the intricacies of adolescence. In addition to grieving the suicide death of his close buddy Michael, Charlie is also battling a troubled past and ongoing challenges related to his mental health. As a result of his feelings of alienation and social ineptitude, he begins high school with the tendency to view life from the periphery, earning him the nickname ""wallflower.""Throughout the book, Charlie writes about the events that have happened to him, how his relationships with his family and friends have developed, and his efforts to come to terms with his history. The narrative touches on a variety of topics, including the difficulties associated with fitting in, the significance of self-expression, the influence of previous traumatic experiences, and the curative power of human relationshipsThis book impressed me in so many different ways that it quickly became one of my top choices for this month. In my opinion, the story's pace as well as the style in which it was told contributed to the whole experience's high level of engagement for me. Because I was invested in Charlie's life, I was curious about what might happen to him in the future. The characters develop quite a bit throughout the story, which is very satisfying to see, even if it is somewhat of a short novel. The author delves into some important topics that are not only fascinating but also highly vital. I appreciated how genuine Charlie's letters were to read. For me, the combination of all of these factors makes this book a winner.Show more"

I don’t know if it would have affected me so much if I hadn’t read it as a teenager, but it hits me the same way every time. I had a professor who commented that it’s a little dated by YA standards, but I (and probably the rest of the fandom) will have to respectfully disagree. It will always have a place on the favorites shelf (you know, the virtual one on Goodreads because I don’t have a favorites shelf). Trigger warnings: suicide, abuse, child molestation, abortion, mental illness.In a series of letters to a stranger, Charlie recounts his first year of high school. At first a loner who observes but doesn’t participate, he makes some senior friends, Sam and Patrick, who introduce him to football games, parties, good music, and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Growing up is never easy though, and certain events bring up memories that Charlie has been doing his best to forget.Excuse me while I cry through this entire book. It’s equal parts sweet and sad, devastating and hopeful. It handles a number of heavy issues, from abusive relationships to the suicide of a close friend. As an adult having seen how far YA has progressed in addressing things like this, I think I can (almost objectively) say that it doesn’t handle all of them as well as it could. Charlie’s troubled history and mental illness don’t really take center stage until well toward the end of the novel, and a lot of it happens off page. He does seek help though, and while it’s a little glossed over, it’s ultimately a positive message. Historically though, it was uncommon for YA to even include issues like this, much less fully work through them, so I like to think it helped set the stage for some of the wonderful representation we have now. (Perhaps it is a little dated in that respect.)I love the characters. Charlie, Sam, and Patrick were some of my first literary friends. Charlie is both a great and a frustrating narrator, since he notices almost everything, but he’s also very young. He doesn’t always understand what he sees or act on it appropriately. As the object of his affection, Sam so easily could have been a manic pixie dream girl, but she isn’t. She and Patrick are both complicated and struggling through their own challenges of growing up, Patrick with his sexuality and Sam with her low self-esteem. They’re all flawed; they all make mistakes, both on page and off, but their friendships are really powerful. Charlie’s family is also fully fleshed out and full of interesting dynamics, and even minor characters make an impact.The writing is sometimes stilted, which I think is Chbosky’s attempt to imitate the voice of a high school freshman, and for the most part, he does a great job. Charlie is clearly extremely smart, but that doesn’t always mean having the words to express himself. There are frequent moments of incredible beauty in the book where he notices things about the world or the people around him with a Charlie-esque insight that’s all his own. It’s highly quoteable; I underline more every time I read it. The novel as a whole is a reminder that beautiful things can happen even in dark places. I think everyone should read it at least once.Love always,CarrieShow more"

Charlie is supposedly brighter than average and excels in English. Reading his letters, however, made me feel he was actually slow. Charlie's English teacher tells him he's the smartest person he's ever known -- not just a student, but as a person. I didn't buy it for a second. The letters Charlie write are filled with the most simple language possible and observations that would have been charming from an eleven year old. From a teenager in his first year of high school the same observations were too innocent, too naive, and even his thoughts on the books he read were depth-less.Charlie's problems are eventually explained and it is the natural end of the book because the thing that has been holding him back from really joining life and not being a wallflower has been resolved. I'm not sure how I feel about the explanation for his behavior, aside from saying I think he was all too forgiving of the person who had done it to him. Still, I enjoyed Charlie's story and the letters he wrote, despite wishing they'd either been written with slightly more sophistication or the pretense of the literary genius had been dropped. I've seen in other reviews people had trouble with some of the tragedy porn. I didn't find any of the events outlandish or unlikely, especially with Charlie's tendency to latch onto damaged people. The things he did and the people he chose to follow around felt like a reflection of the problems he was subconsciously aware he had. I enjoyed the way his relationship with his sister evolved far more than I did his 'romance' with Sam, although the scene where Sam urged Charlie to act rounded out his development in the best way possible.I'm a little old for this book. Charlie's belief that every book and every movie and every experience could change how things were drove me a bit bonkers because I felt the author was speaking to the audience, trying too hard and too obviously for this book to be everyone's teenage catalyst. Less pandering and more focus on the characters would have benefited the story greatly. Three stars. I just said the other day if I'd read one book when I was older I thought it would've been four stars. Well, if I'd read this book a bit younger this would've been four stars.Show more"

The gut-wrenching turn that the story book was entirely heartbreaking and made the books that much more devastating. Beautiful books always seem to be the most heartbreaking ones! Written from the perspective of young Charlie, the journey of friendship and accpetance is what created such a loved and treaured book. It goes without saying that teen books can't go without controversy, and this book definitely had elements that were a bit more mature and harder to deal with. In site of the slower parts, the overall brilliance of the story is noticeable throughout the engire read. As someone who has read by fair share of YA books, I am always impressed when a novel can accurating depict the awkward and weird aspects of being a teen. Charlie's attitude and wallflower tendencies are extremely exposed. They are also very relatable to introverts and further him as a very loveable character. As he find friendship within the blurry but sweet world of Sam and Patrick, Charlie is finally able to experience the dips of highs (quite literally) and lows that life offers. The beautiful truth of life and the human experience is layed out simply during this book, and it is one that I will always remember and be haunted by. ☆☆☆☆☆/5Show more"

I know this is a matter of taste, but when I read a story, even if it's a contemporary, I just need something, to look forward to: without it, everything just seems a little flat. With that being sad, I enjoyed this book because of the main character, whom I fell in love with from the first page, and identified with very much because he is so much like my younger brother and my family is so much like the one in the book. I also loved the representation of mental illness, which I found very accurate because, as I said, it reminded of my younger brother who struggled with a very similar kind of condition: being sensitive. That's right, it seems like today being very sensitive, especially for a boy, it is some kind of illness. You start feeling isolated, alone, communicating with other people is hard, family relationships and relationships in general are hard, etc. and, in the end, it just escalates and you start feeling suicidal. I'm happy I read this book, even though it touched me more than what feels comfortable, but I am trying my best to get out of my comfort zone when it comes to reading, so I guess I did the right thing in picking this up. I really want to watch the movie now, but I don't know how a story ""where nothing really happens"" can make a good movie... maybe I should stop reading so much horror and fantasy and just get back to real word for once. Ahah. I enjoyed the writing style, it manages to get in the head of a 15 yo boy without ever being cringy or unrealistic, and I have many favourite quotes from this book.

So this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
I watched this movie years ago when it came out and just loved every single second of it. But at the same time I felt a loss deep within me because I hadn't yet read the book, and was very scared for years that I had just destroyed some book magic. And then when I picked this one up during the summer of 2017 and finally read it, I had a very unusual reaction to it.I never reviewed it and I never remembered much about that actual book except that it wasn't near as good as the movie version which never happens. So I wanted to read it again to see if I still felt the same way. And after my reread I definitely felt likeThis book was everything to me and made me feel all of the things. It was every single bit as good as the movie (and the movie really captured what this book was all about). It reminded me of so many things about myself when I was younger and was just a realistic portrayal of that age where you feel pushed and pulled between fitting in and being yourself. Finding acceptance, overcoming trauma. I loved these characters. I loved the 90s high school setting. I loved the real issues discussed, and never for one single second did this feel inauthentic to me. Charlie's voice was so real and so resonant and I just kept wishing that he were a friend of mine. I loved Sam and Patrick for seeing what was so special inside him the whole time, things his own family didn't notice.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
All throughout high school I had a very specific set of girlfriends. We had been friends since middle school and we were together all the time. I couldn't imagine a time when we wouldn't be friends anymore. They were almost a safety net. A comfortable nest where I felt comfortable and accepted.  At the beginning of my senior year, something happened between myself and one of those girlfriends that changed everything. I started to see my friends' true colors come out and slowly I began to distance myself from my group of friends. I had some hard times during that autumn. I skipped school on several occasions, began eating lunch in my classrooms instead of the cafeteria, and spent my weekends at home. I began to see my group of friends for what it was: a clique. And I wanted no part of it anymore. I started hanging out with a different crowd that I had met through drama club, and these became the friends I remembered the most from my senior year. No one was particularly popular and no one belonged to any type of ""group."" We were a group of misfits of sorts. We had conversations that revolved around things other than shopping and boys. When we would get together, we would pretty much just talk. We were all a lot ""older"" than others in my graduating class. Without feeling superior, I felt like I finally had friends who challenged me, and I finally felt more like myself. My best friend to this day was one of those friends I became close to that year. And I still keep in touch with many of them.The reason I being this story up is because I felt much like Charlie does in this book. It takes place in 1991 when things were not as out in the open as they are today. Mental illness was not as talked about. Being gay was not necessarily something to be embraced and proud of. Autism was not diagnosed as easily. Discussing trauma was discouraged and something to feel ashamed of. So many of these characters struggle through real issues in this book, but never did this book feel overly heavy or depressing. Each character was painted perfectly and each played such a critical role in Charlie's life. After reading this again, I am positive that Charlie has a high functioning form of autism. And even though that is never explicitly stated in this book, constantly Charlie wonders why he is so different from everyone else, why he thinks differently from everyone. Since this entire book is written as a group of letters that Charlie writes to an unnamed pen pal, we are inside Charlie's head constantly. Something that is true for me now that wasn't back when I read this for the first time is that I now work with autistic children. I have met and worked with several. I know how autism affects relating to others and communication. I know how an autistic brain sorts and filters information. And Charlie's voice is definitely that of someone who is autistic, albeit very high functioning. Autism was not nearly as much of a thing in 1991 so it is very likely that he would never have had an official diagnosis back then. But it is probably why he feels like he has never belonged. It is why he is ""special"" to his family and ""weird"" to outsiders. Charlie lacks nuance in his thinking and his speech. He is almost amusingly literal in his way of thinking. And it was so endearing and authentic and lovely to read about. Charlie's differences also makes his relationship with Bill the teacher so much more relevant. It is obvious that Charlie relates more to adults than to kids his own age which is evident in his relationship with his teacher. Bill sees something in Charlie, something that makes him unique and special. Sam and Patrick also saw these things. I also think his aunt Helen saw him this way. But others just may have viewed him as quirky. It is Patrick who calls out Charlie's ""Wallflower status"" early on in the book, and it is part of what makes Charlie's presence in their group so special.
You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.
Sam and Patrick do seem much older than the rest of their friends, but I also think that there are true traumas in both of their pasts that make this seem a little more realistic and sincere. Most teenagers want to think of themselves as ""more mature"" or ""older"" than their peers when really they aren't. Mary Elizabeth is a prime example of this: buying Charlie a book of poetry to show how ""well-read"" and ""intelligent"" she is, when it is really just smoke and mirrors: she never discusses anything with him because appearances are what matter to her. She wants people to view her as deep, when she lacks that depth, just like most people her age. Sam is different. She has a maturity about her that her friends do not. An ""old soul"" if you will. Every once in awhile I've met an old soul lingering in a teenage body, and Sam seems to fit this bill very well. A big unrevealed trauma is also alluded to several times throughout the book that leads me to believe that Sam has had to grow up rather quickly. She also is the first to really see Charlie's shine and to embrace him and love him for who he is. Patrick was my favorite character by a mile. He has the most depth, the most personality, and I loved loved loved him. And being a gay teenager in 1991, right smack dap in the middle of the AIDS epidemic, was not the easiest thing to deal with probably, but Patrick is so beautifully himself throughout this entire book that it was hard not to root for him all the way. 
Patrick used to be popular before Sam bought him some good music.
I give this book literally all the stars that I can throw at it. I didn't even feel like I was reading a YA book at all. Just something that so genuinely reflects the human condition in the time period in which it takes place. I loved the way that Charlie communicated using mix tapes, and that his two best friends Sam and Patrick heard him and felt him and accepted him for it. I even loved the growth in Charlie's relationship with his siblings, found it realistic and very well written. There is a very ""that's life"" feel to this book that I really dug. It was a book about misfits without being too over the top dramatic. And it took me two sittings to read the whole thing. I am so happy that I reread this one, and it is going straight to the top of my ""favorites"" list.All the stars.
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.

La cosa no pinta demasiado bien el primer día de instituto cuando solo consigue hacer un amigo: un alternativo profesor de Lengua interesado en despertar el genio creativo de Charlie.Cuando conoce a la bella Sam y al excéntrico Patrick, unos chicos llenos de ganas de exprimir la vida al máximo, empieza a comprender lo que es crecer y hacerse adulto.

Of infinity Those were probably the toughest four years of my life. I was not comfortable in my own skin. I wouldn't relive those years unless I were offered a LOT of $$$. Charlie is s truly special young man. I found him to be especially sensitive and emotionally immature, which were huge clues that something was very wrong. It made my heart happy that he found friends in that quirky group of seniors, a group that loved him for himself, who accepted him. He had a healthy home life, he had a brilliant mind, but he was psychologically repressed. I can see why this book spoke to so many young adults. Just when they are looking for someone to understand themselves, here is a book telling their story. I don't think I would have enjoyed watching this movie at all.

This book is definitely not a 2-star read as I previously rated	2. But it’s also not as phenomenal as people claimPerhaps I’m not in the right age range and that’s why for the majority of the novel I found myself struggling to relate to anything. But I also want to mention how it’s the writing that made it hard to get into the story, as well. It just doesn’t flow. And I know it’s written in diary format so it’s “supposed” to be in Charlie’s young 15 year-old self; that said, it still flowed oddly.More importantly, I didn’t like any of the characters (except for Charlie) and that made it tough for me to see why Charlie liked them. Why he liked Sam, especially. But alas, I still think this is an important book in its own way. But I think you should be in your teens to fully appreciate it.Show more"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower already had so many odds againt it before I read it, I think it's almost a bit unfair. This was one of the few scenarios when I watched the film before reading the book. I didn't care for the film, but my friend loved the book. He handed it to me a few days ago and said, ""You're going to read this."" And so I did. I read it even though I was sure that if I had a nickel for every time I saw the quotes, ""We accept the love we think we deserve,"" or ""In that moment, I swear we were infinite,"" on a hipster photo, my wealth would rival Beyonce's. I read it even though the movie was disappointing. And I read it even though I had a strong feeling that it wouldn't be my cup of tea. I tried my best to go into this one with an open mind. And while I did not despise this book, I didn't particularly enjoy it. Charlie was a strange character. I had a difficult time relating to him. He didn't feel like a 15/16 year old to me. Instead, he sounded more like a young, naive child, despite some heavy themes of sex, drugs, and sexual assault. Perhaps that was intentional, as this book documents his growth as a character, but I found it a bit jarring. His closest friends, Sam and Patrick, weren't particularly appealing to me either. Sam was a girl that caused my feelings towards her character to be pulled in different directions. Patrick was funny and provided bursts of delight, but also had that certain misfit quality that all of the characters had. This book is written in letters to an anonymous ""friend."" And while I thought it was fitting of Charlie's character to write this whole book in letters, it also failed to compel me. There was no constant plot going on to leave me wanting more. In a way, if I stopped after one letter and never picked the book up again, the story would've still felt complete. The writing is very dull and dry, in my opinion. Similar words and phrases are constantly repeated, making the reading experience very tiring. There are certain parts that contain a subtle beauty, such as the quotes that have been tired out by all the pictures and bracelets they've been printed on, but overall, the writing was very lacking of emotion. Perhaps my review is unfair because I already has a preconception of the book, but The Perks of Being a Wallflower failed to impress me, despite the many fans of it that I've encountered. I'm not sure if I'd personally recommend it, but many people love this novel, so I would encourage other interested readers to give it a shot. 2.5 keys.SophiaThe Book BasementShow more"

When I think of you, I like to believe you're surrounded by people who are full of love as much as you are and that they make you feel safe. Please, tell me you continued writing letters to your anonymous friend, because if I were him/her, I couldn't have born losing you.You had a rough childhood and most of the things that happened, you couldn't even understand properly, but you showed that just because bad stuff happen doesn't mean you have to become a bad person. You may be fragile and small, but you're a fighter and you know how to defend yourself. You're witty, funny and too emotional for your own good. I hope your psychological disorder doesn't affect your relationships with people anymore.  “What's your favorite book? ""The last one I read.” Read ""The Book Thief"". You'll see that you and Liesel have a few traits in common. ""Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve.”  Your professor Bill is a smart guy. This quote really bugs me because it's so true and I don't like it. I'm glad he recognized how talented you are and I hope he wasn't the only one. The hardest thing is to let people in and you didn't really know how to do that. You were always there when everyone needed you, you've always put everyone's needs before yours. You thought your needs don't matter. But they do, Charlie. “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”  No one before you could really explain that feeling when you want for time to stop. You're exceptional, you feel every single emotion every minute of the day and I don't know how you manage, how you don't get emotionally exhausted, how you don't run away.  “Patrick actually used to be popular before Sam bought him some good music.”  Patrick and Sam were both lonely and insecure people and they created they own world in which they were glorious and exstatic. I envy them. i envy you because you were of their world and they saved you. I hope they're still in your life because it's rare what three of you had.  “There is this one photograph. That is just beautiful. It would be impossible to describe how beautiful it is, but I’ll try. If you listen to the song “Asleep,” and you think about those pretty weather days that make you remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes you’ve known, and you cry and the person holds you back, then I think you will see the photograph. ” This is the exact feeling when I listen to The Smiths, one of my favorite bands. Also, I wish one day, someone will love me the way you love sam. You don't idealize her and you don't get obsessive over her, you love her for who she really is. You want her to happy, but you should've been more persistent about telling her how you really feel. YOU made her gleeful.  ��It's like he would take a photograph of Sam, and the photograph would be beautiful. And he would think that the reason the photograph was beautiful was because of how he took it. If I took it, I would know that the only reason it's beautiful is because of Sam.”  You're such an angel and I can't describe how fond I am of you, Charlie. “Personally, I like to think my brother is having a college experience like they do in the movies. I don't mean the big fraternity party kind of movie. More like the movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss in the rain. I think something like that would be very good for him, especially if the girl were unconventionally beautiful. They are the best kind of girls, I think. I personally find 'super models' strange. I don't know why this is.”  Every girl will be lucky to have you. You don't find any taboo inflexible, you accepted Patrick's sexuality like there was nothing unusual to comprehend, you loved your sister unconditionaly even though you didn't agreed with most of her choices, you still loved your aunt Helen despite the fact she's the on who hurt you the most - you're an angel, Charlie.  “I don't know if it's better to be close with your daughter or make sure that she has a better life than you do.”  I'm very sensitive when it comes to father-daughter relationship. I'm so glad that my father find a way to be both a parent and a friend to me. We're very close and I honestly, I can't imagine my life without him. I'm glad your parents did the same with you, Charlie. You're so lucky. They support you and let you find your way to deal with the pain.  Just before she feel asleep, she said, ""Well, it you're going to smoke, crack the window at least.""Which made me start laughing again.""Charlie, smoking. I can't believe it. Which made me laugh harder, and I said, ""I love you."" And my sister said, ""I love you too. Just stop it with the laughing already.”  I hope your sister earned some self-respect in the end. I really do. She has potential of becoming a decent human being and I wish that now she deserves your unconditional love and that she learned how to reciprocate. “The movie itself was very interesting, but I didn't think it was very good because I didn't really feel different when it was over.”  If you don't stop feeling to the bone every single thing you're going to be more messed up than you ever were. I get how you feel about art and I admire it, but if your overthinking is destructive.  “I would give someone a record so they could love the record, not so they would always know that I gave it to them.”  Charlie, you're priceless.  “I don't know how much longer I can keep going without a friend. I used to be able to do it very easily, but that was before I knew what having a friend was like.”  You take being social and reclusive, at the same time, to a whole new level. I was so proud of you when you defended Patrick. You're my hero, Charlie.  “There's nothing like deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reasons.”  I felt everything you felt. I was trying to study for my exam, but you're letters didn't let me.  “I sat down and tried to write a story. ""Ian MacArthur is a wonderful sweet fellow who wears glasses and peers out of them with delight."" That was the first sentence. The problem was that I just couldn't think of the next one. After cleaning my room three times, I decided to leave Ian alone for a while because I was starting to get mad at him.”  You're absolutely hilarious. I was laughing so hard at this one. It's a crazy ride being in your head. “I would die for you. But I won't live for you.”  This is the best quote in all of your letters. It's life-changing and makes you question all your relationships. It sums up pretty much everything that real love should be. “Charlie, don’t you get it? I can’t feel that. It’s sweet and everything, but it’s like you’re not even there sometimes. It’s great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when someone doesn’t need a shoulder? What if they need the arms or something like that? You can’t just sit there and put everybody’s lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can’t. You have to do things.” Don't ever let go of Sam. She is pure gold. I admire her so much.  “It's just that I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it too.” Not all of us could've been so self-consious at 17 like Sam.  “So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.” <`i> This quote gives me faith that you're alright and that you've found peace. You deserve it. Love,KayaShow more"

I had intended to, trust me, for a long time. Was wondering whether I should write at all, it was a long time since you were 17, actually. In the end I thought I should, for seldom can I relate myself to any of the youth nowadays; but, in your scenario, though we are a lot different by our culture, lifestyle, and all that, your story is still highly resounding. I felt so, at least. To tell you about your book(yes it is one now), it can simultaneously be said nothing out of ordinary, yet highly inspiring in many aspects, with your love for family and friends (which is natural yet quite missing in the youth today), for life-shaping books, for good music. And the way you used to write for Bill, is actually the entire inspiration behind my starting to write reviews. And that's few of the many reasons your letters mean so much to me.Another reason your letters are important, is that you voiced some of the few problems teenagers
 actually 
face( I don't call breakup a teenage problem). Suffice my saying this much to your problems: I guess you had to visit psychiatrist for one reason before all, that you don't exactly fit in your milieus. Trust me a lot of us do face the same problem...so you weren't (it's past) alone. Just say that there's no family in the world that's not dysfunctional, or close to being one. (And quote Tolstoy's so famed beginning:""
All happy families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in it's own way.
"", so you can't relate exactly). I know you didn't complain of anything actually, but, one thing: you did receive a huge proportion of the love you deserved, and your favorite novelist(one) did say:""
 Whenever you feel like criticising anyone,... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.
""Just say that I'm happy you sounded happy at the end, and planned to face your problems rather than be morose. But, I would have dearly loved to know what happened thereafter. With Patrick. Sam. Your sister. You. But still, you don't need to write an epilogue for us. A long time has passed since and time does change one's perspective towards life, no matter how much indistinctly whatsoever. So I'm fine withwhat you shared of us, and I don't need no more, better reread what has stayed yet. And I promise it will stay.--From your friendShow more"

But when two seniors take him under their crazy wings, Charlie tumbles head first into their world and all it involves, really finding himself along the way. Charlie mirrors a lot of mister Holden from Catcher in the Rye, yet with all new twists. The typical troubled youth finds out the truth behind his childhood and it's a thrilling, but heavy journey.

Phim ổn, có sự hài hước và nét duyên dáng riêng nhờ vào các tình tiết mới lạ so với sách và diễn xuất cực kỳ nhập vai của Logan Lerman, Emma Watson và Ezra Miller trong vai Charlie, Sam và Patrick. Logan Lerman thể hiện được rõ nét đáng yêu, nhạy cảm và nhút nhát của nhân vật chính. Chưa kể là anh ấy đã đẹp trai rồi (mình thích Logan Lerman từ hồi coi ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Bolt""), Ezra Miller còn đẹp trai hơn :D. Tuy nhiên nếu đem phim so với sách thì mình vẫn thích sách hơn nhiều, vì sách có độ sâu sắc và cảm động riêng mà phim không sao bằng được (mặc dù nhân vật Patrick trên phim thì đúng là cool ngầu và thú vị hơn nhiều so với Patrick trong truyện :D).Có một điều phải nói là mind-blowing mà xem phim mình mới nhận ra, đó là việc dì Helen của Charlie đã lạm dụng tình dục cậu khi cậu còn nhỏ. Xem phim tới khúc gần cuối, những flashbacks của Charlie gắn liền với hành động lạm dụng của dì Helen trỗi dậy khi Sam âu yếm cậu trong phòng làm mình bất ngờ bẹt ngửa, phải lật đật lên topic này của goodreads để check lại, và quả đúng như vậy: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...Hóa ra có nhiều người đã nhận ra điều này khi đọc sách, và cũng có nhiều người như mình, lúc đọc sách lần đầu thì nhìn không ra, coi phim xong mới biết. Phim thì làm rõ ràng rồi, các chi tiết cứ hiện ra trước mắt nên dễ dàng nhìn thấy ngay, còn sách thì đúng là tác giả viết kiểu subtle quá, lúc đọc chắc tại mình đọc nhanh nên không dành thời gian ra ngẫm nghĩ và suy xét rõ từng câu chữ nên đã bỏ qua cái big revelation này. Ban đầu mình chỉ nghĩ, đơn giản là Charlie bị ám ảnh bởi mặc cảm tội lỗi, rằng vì dì Helen đi mua quà Giáng sinh bên cạnh món quà sinh nhật cho cậu (Charlie sinh vào ngày 24/12) mà dì mới bị tai nạn giao thông và qua đời. Mình luôn nghĩ tình trạng tâm thần bất ổn của Charlie, việc cậu phải đi điều trị tâm lý với chuyên gia, chuyện cậu chơi thuốc ảo giác LSD, những ký ức liên quan đến dì Helen lâu lâu lại hiện lên, những giấc mơ ám ảnh... chỉ đơn giản là vì cái mặc cảm tội lỗi đó. Ai ngờ đâu mọi thứ còn sâu xa và rúng động hơn thế. Mới lôi sách ra đọc lại đoạn cuối, đặc biệt là đọc lại những câu khi Charlie miêu tả khoảnh khắc Sam chạm vào đùi cậu, khiến ký ức về hành động lạm dụng của dì Helen trỗi dậy, và cuối cùng thì mình đã hiểu. Trời ơi, làm sao ở lần đọc đầu tiên, mình lại có thể bỏ qua một chi tiết quan trọng đến như vậy chứ ahhhh!!!!!! Điều này càng chứng tỏ việc lạm dụng tình dục trẻ em không phải là một điều dễ dàng nhận ra. Luôn luôn có những dấu hiệu nhưng không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng, và cần phải để ý quan sát thật kỹ mới biết được...Old review:Mình mua cuốn này từ lâu lắm rồi, nhớ hồi đó có đợt sách của NXB Trẻ đồng loạt giảm giá mạnh trên Tiki, nên mình hốt luôn, vì mình đã biết đến phim “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” từ trước đó và muốn đọc sách trước. Hốt sách về nhưng rồi mình không đọc liền, cứ để đó, kiểu không có hứng nên chưa thèm đọc. Để rồi hôm qua đọc xong một cuốn sách về đề tài học đường khá hay của Mỹ là Nhật ký bí mật của Simon, và tự dưng mình nổi hứng muốn đọc thêm các tác phẩm khác cũng về đề tài này. Thế là mình lôi “Điệu vũ bên lề” ra, sách in bằng giấy tái chế, xốp xốp mà để lâu rồi nên ố vàng nhiều chỗ, thêm cái bìa xấu mắc ớn. Nhưng mà nội dung thì hay cực kỳ.Không hiểu sao ngay từ khi đọc câu văn đầu tiên của cuốn sách là mình đã thấy thích nó lắm rồi, và mình biết ngay rằng mình phải cho cuốn này 5 sao chứ không thể nào khác được (chắc là linh cảm của đứa mọt sách lâu năm :D). Cái kiểu trình bày câu chuyện thông qua những lá thư do nhân vật chính Charlie viết cho độc giả đọc vào thấy thân tình lắm. Nó khác với cách kể chuyện thông thường, bởi có cái gì đó rất riêng tư và đặc biệt, như thể không phải mình đang đọc một cuốn tiểu thuyết mà là một cuốn hồi ký của nhân vật Charlie ấy. Những mẩu chuyện và chia sẻ trong thư cũng xoay quanh cái thế giới của một thiếu niên 15 tuổi, quay cuồng giữa việc trường lớp, bạn bè, gia đình, tình yêu. Ấy vậy mà khi gắn vào những nhân vật cụ thể, có một câu chuyện cuộc đời riêng, thì bỗng chốc những đề tài tưởng chừng như bình thường đó lại trở nên cảm động và đáng nhớ vô cùng.Đó là cái thế giới của những người trẻ đang dần trưởng thành, thế giới của tình dục, cần sa, chất gây ảo giác LSD, bạo lực trong quan hệ tình cảm (domestic violence), phá thai, quan hệ đồng tính, những sai lầm và tan vỡ trong tình yêu. Ở giữa thế giới ấy là một Charlie bị ám ảnh bởi cái chết của người dì Helen của mình, mặc cảm vì nghĩ rằng mình đã gián tiếp gây nên cái chết ấy, một Charlie với tâm thần bất ổn, nhưng ẩn chứa bên trong đó là một chàng trai trẻ với trí thông minh, sự thấu cảm và suy nghĩ sâu sắc cực kỳ. Thế giới ấy còn có một chàng trai đồng tính, nhưng vì gia đình phản đối mà phải dựa vào những cơn say rượu và phê thuốc để có thể sống thực với giới tính của bản thân. Thế giới ấy còn có Sam và Patrick, hai anh em khác cha khác mẹ đã có đủ lòng tốt để giúp Charlie - một chàng trai luôn phải thường xuyên đối mặt với sự cô độc - tìm thấy được tình bạn và nơi cậu thuộc về trong môi trường cấp 3 khắc nghiệt. Trong mắt mình, ”Vũ điệu bên lề” chính là một dạng truyện thanh xuân vườn trường của Mỹ, vì cái cảm giác nao lòng và xúc động mà câu chuyện của Charlie mang lại, câu chuyện của một lớp những con người vật lộn với những chông chênh trong quá trình trưởng thành, giữa một thanh xuân đầy những bất ổn và những thời khắc đầy biến động, chông gai. Có nhiều người sẽ đánh giá những bạn trẻ ấy là những kẻ học đòi, suốt ngày đắm mình trong những buổi tiệc tùng thâu đêm suốt sáng, trong rượu chè, say xỉn và những cơn phê thuốc triền miên. Nhưng đối với mình, sau khi đã trải qua những cung bậc cảm xúc của Charlie cùng những người bạn của cậu, thì mình nhận ra, phải có lý do mà những bạn trẻ ấy chọn cho mình cách sống như những tên nghiện, những kẻ phớt đời không quan tâm đến sức khỏe hay ngày mai; phải có lý do mà Charlie dùng LSD tới mức phải vào bệnh viện… Họ là những mảnh tâm hồn nhạy cảm, bị nứt rạn bởi cái khó khăn và sự dữ dội của cái thời khi họ phải học cách trưởng thành, học cách đối mặt với bóng ma quá khứ, với từng mớ cảm xúc đau đớn và hỗn độn của bản thân.Điều mình thích hơn cả ở cuốn sách này, đó là nó không chỉ gói gọn những trải nghiệm trong thời gian trưởng thành của Charlie ở môi trường lớp học. Nó còn là câu chuyện về quá khứ bất hạnh và phức tạp của gia đình bên nội và bên ngoại của Charlie, của những con người mang những tính cách và số phận khác nhau, tất cả làm nên một gia đình thuộc tầng lớp lao động điển hình của Mỹ, mang trong mình ước mong rằng con cái, cháu chắt sẽ đổi đời để không còn phải cực khổ như bậc ông bà, cha mẹ chúng. Và ở giữa gia đình ấy, dẫu có trải qua rất nhiều sự bất đồng, cãi vã, không ưa lẫn nhau, cuối cùng thì Charlie vẫn tìm thấy tình yêu và ý nghĩa của việc sống trên đời, của việc đối mặt với những nỗi đau, những cảm xúc của bản thân, của sự hiện hữu.Nổi bật nhất trong câu chuyện này phải nói đến mối quan hệ giữa Charlie và thầy giáo Bill của cậu, người thầy với gu chọn sách chuẩn không chê vào đâu được, đã giúp Charlie dần dần nhận ra tiềm năng và trí thông minh của mình. Kết những cuốn sách thầy Bill chọn chọn Charlie, cùng những lần thầy bắt cậu viết bài luận sau khi đọc (mặc dù nhiều cuốn trong số đó mình chưa đọc, có những cuốn đọc rồi thì mình cũng không thực sự thích lắm đâu, nhưng đối với mình, những cuốn đó đều là những tác phẩm quan trọng cần đọc của văn chương nhân loại). Đoạn khi thầy Bill mời Charlie tới nhà thầy chơi, rồi nói cho cậu biết cậu thông minh và đặc biệt đến dường nào, rằng thầy luôn sẵn sàng giúp đỡ cậu với tư cách một người bạn, dẫu sau này thầy không còn dạy cậu nữa, làm mình muốn khóc. Ước gì thời cấp 3 ngày xưa ấy, mình cũng có một người thầy, người cô giới thiệu cho mình nhiều cuốn sách hay như thế, bắt mình viết nhiều bài luận như thế, giúp mình phát triển tư duy và khả năng cảm thụ văn học như thế, thì chắc là bây giờ lượng sách văn học nước ngoài mình đọc được đã nhiều hơn rất nhiều rồi ^^Còn Charlie thì mình ấn tượng với gu chọn nhạc của cậu. List bài hát cậu thu trong cuốn băng tặng Patrick nhân dịp Giáng sinh, mình lên mạng kiếm nghe cho bằng hết. Mặc dù không phải bài nào cũng hợp tai mình, nhưng nhìn chung là nhạc chất quá chất :)) Còn đoạn kết nữa, cái cảm giác như thể mình vô tận, như thể mình chẳng còn sợ hãi điều gì, rằng mọi thứ rồi sẽ ổn cả. Một cuốn sách tuyệt vời và gây nghiện. Nguyên cuốn sách 290 trang, mình đọc liền tù tì từ hôm qua tới hôm nay là hết. Ngày mai phải xem phim ngay và luôn he he :DP.S.: Bản dịch của NXB Trẻ có chỗ ngộ lắm, cái tựa cuốn tiểu thuyết A Separate Peace của tác giả John Knowles, Trẻ dịch thành 3 phiên bản khác nhau: ở bìa sau thì là “Thanh bình riêng lẻ”, vô trong truyện, đoạn giữa thì là “Hòa bình độc lập”, đoạn kết thì là “Hòa bình chia cắt”.

From our initial introduction to Charlie to his tumultuous middle, and culminating in what some have called ""the perfect ending,"" Stephen Chbosky has created some of the most realistic and heartwarming characters I've had the pleasure of meeting in a very, VERY long time.. perhaps ever. Almost all of his characters of finely tuned machines, but none so lovely and imbued with life as our protagonist, Charlie. In him, I felt like I've know him for years, or my whole life, and that's largely due to the many similarities we share. I could relate to him on a level I'd never experienced before. And probably never will. In fact, it felt like he trusted me enough to bare his soul to me courtesy of his sometimes deeply personal, always profound letters. Taking things a step further, I felt like the author was inexplicably telling my story. That is how real Perks felt (and still feels) to me! And now, having said good-bye, or ""see ya later,"" as Sam would say, I miss Charlie and the gang greatly... my heart longs to be with them once again... I'm speechless. To say any more would not only spoil this beautiful novel, but somehow diminish its strength, because 'less is more.' I will, however, leave you with my absolute favorite passage of the entire book. It's also some of the most exquisite and frankly, stunning writing I've ever read!  ""There's something about that tunnel that leads to downtown. It's glorious at night. Just glorious. You start on one side of the mountain, and it's dark, and the radio is loud. As you enter the tunnel, the wind gets sucked away, and you squint from the lights overhead. When you adjust to the lights, you can see the other side in the distance just as the sound of the radio fades to nothing because the waves just can't reach. Then, you're in the middle of the tunnel, and everything becomes a calm dream. As you see the opening get closer, you just can't get there fast enough. And finally, just when you think you'll never get there, you see the opening right in front of you. And the radio comes back even louder than you remember it. And the wind is waiting. And you fly out of the tunnel onto the bridge. And there it is. The city. A million lights and buildings and everything seems as exciting as the first time you saw it. It really is a grand entrance."" ""And in that moment, I swear we were infinite!""Show more"

Or five. Or one. Or you know, maybe like ever. *incoherent grumbling*)Plan on diving into this for a round two verrrry soon!_________________________________________Original thoughts circa 2013:Actual rating: 3.5 stars.Seeing as I read Perks of Being A Wallflower almost a year back, I'm deeming it near impossible to jot down a proper review that would stay true to how it made me feel. I distinctly remember gobbling this up in one sitting, and this was around the time the movie hit the theaters, so I was kind of having a parallel ""watch-movie-read-book-athon"" thing going on.Now, just two days back, I watched the film again -in HD and not blurred and barely comprehensible quality thankyouverymuch- and I was thinking to myself: three stars? What in the world was I thinking? This was simply beautiful. I just have to read it again now! (Except I can't because it's been cruelly locked away in a teacher's rotting locker at school for months now thanks to a certain friend. *wails*)I believe my problem wasn't with the story itself, but the way it was weaved out. I haven't read any other books by Stephen Chbosky and where he definitely isn't a terrible author (not even close!), the novel's tempo just wasn't cutting it for me. It wasn't boring to the point where I couldn't read any further, but at the same time, it also wasn't indulging enough to keep me on my toes and propel me into a whirlwind of emotions like I'd hoped.Charlie's introverted personality is what first and foremost lured me into picking this up; and whereas the movie turned out to be delightfully exquisite and moving, the book –strangely enough– did not. I can't for the life of me figure out where it went wrong (or why), but I sailed through the novel without feeling all that much for the characters, whilst still simultaneously sharing a lot in common with good ol' Charlie here.For me, I'd say this is one of those rare cases where the film adaption wins me over the book. But without said book itself, there wouldn't have been a movie in the first place and for that, I am thankful, Mr. Chbosky.Show more"

He spend his time observing others while not being observed himself. When Charlie meets Sam and Patrick he suddenly has friends and begins navigating high school and the awkward teen years with first dates and family dramas along with things like sex, drugs and rock and roll. As popular as this book is I really didn't know what I was getting into when I picked it up. Yes, I knew Charlie and his friends must be on the outs of the popular crowd but I didn't realize just how different Charlie was until getting into the story. Now, this book is written in the form of letters that young Charlie is writing anonymously to a pen pal so you really get inside of his true thoughts throughout the read. Things that Charlie wouldn't ever tell anyone he is telling the reader through the book. The writing took a while to get used to but the quirky style it's written in fits the quirky character the book is about. And as you read the book becomes more and more emotional as one gets to know Charlie and his world. Overall, definitely an interesting read that while it took some getting used to I don't regret learning of Charlie and his world.

First because this story is absolutely amazing. It sneaks on you slowly, disguised as a harmless coming of age, high-school YA story and then... BAM! It messes up with you! you are left wondering what happened but TOTALLY happy about the emotional wreck in a way only a bookworm can be!Second, because Charlie is one the most lovable characters you would ever read! He is an adorably, awkward, introvert bookworm that talks a lot about books. There is a reason why he is the way he is, and says the most awkward things in the most awkward moments [which you'd need to read the book to find out]  but the things he says and does are just... So innocent, honest and plainly adorable! He is an introvert (and therefore, a great listener), people trust him with the most incredible secrets and he gets involved in the most interesting of situations making this book incredibly entertaining.And third, the format and POV. This book is written in the form of letter from Charlie to a friend [unknown to the reader until the end] and it’s more like a diary with all his most private thoughts and moments and it’s just so real, and vulnerable, and naïve, and innocent, and honest, and just plain wonderful!Show more"

I love how strong the narrator's voice is, speaking directly to the dark, quiet spaces the readers mind.

(If I hadn't started so late in the day, it would have been.) I have to say it really shocked the hell out of me how much I ended up enjoying it. It’s not that I’ve been living on Mars or just flat out ignorant of the fact that this book was hugely popular. Or even that there was a movie made of it a couple years ago. This just isn’t my typical type of book and really didn’t ever plan on reading it. I had this impression that it would be a sort of cheesy, high school book about a nerdy introvert that’s mostly fluffy fun. But that's not what I got at all. The more I read, the more I realized that this was such a pensive and thoughtful look on those fragile teen years. When everything is bright and exhilerating, but on the opposite side of the coin, painful and uncertain. And it was so genuine feeling, at times I found myself wondering if any of this was based on the author's real life experiences.We all have ideas of what we think we’ll like based on our past reads. But lately, all these books that have so much so-called potential have been falling flat too many times. So I agreed to read this with my friend and just keep my mind open to something different. And clearly, based on my rating, I’m glad I did. I didn’t analyze it as I read it, or even pick out quotes. I just experienced it. And you really can’t read this one any other way. This book is entirely written through Charlie’s narrative in his letters to a mystery person. It's open to interpretation who it is he's pouring his heart out to, and I loved that. It was very personal and diary-like and allows us into his deep-set hopes, dreams, and fears. I loved how engagingly it was written, it really brought me back those school years when everything was uncertain and your future right there on the horizon. Yes, Charlie was a shy introvert, but he was defined by much more than that. And you experience his experiences through his eyes. You feel his emotions through the mundane details as well as the more evocative details of his life. He’s a deep thinker, and mature before his years, but in other ways still kind of naive. Really, you see that this intelligent boy with a genuine heart is kind of drifting through life feeling invisible by his family and everyone at school. His best friend’s suicide in middle school deeply affected him as well as his Aunt’s death later on. And now he's just trying to find people who will finally make him feel at home. Enter Sam and Patrick. They're seniors and Charlie a lowly freshman. But they show him immediate acceptance and all of a sudden he's not just that lonely, quiet kid anymore. Charlie is so sweet and charming he just takes over your heart with his thoughts on love, family, school, and his ponderings of what the future will hold. How the past has affected those he loves and how his actions at that moment will affect his own future. When he came up with the idea to give his mother a present on his own birthday to show his love and appreciation for her, it just put the biggest smile on my face. Or when he gave everyone Christmas gifts that were personal and unexpected. Most guys that age aren't so insightful but in other ways he was idealistic and unable to face certain realities. Like his love for Sam. The dreaded truth or dare kiss at the party was not his finest moment. I came to love Sam and Patrick just as much as Charlie. Their acceptance and friendship was in a word, everything. They brought out Charlie's courage, his adventurous side, and helped him open his eyes to a lot of things. Even though there wasn't the type of romantic thread running through it that I'm used to, or even remotely any amount of erotic moments, I wouldn't have changed the story in any way. It just illustrates how we need to step outside our self-constructed reading boxes and shake things up. I'm so happy I made the decision to read this, it's so thought provoking and something that will stand out for it's thoughts on love, friendship, and one boy's self-discovery.FOLLOW SMOKIN HOT BOOK BLOG ON: Show more"

A happier, more hopeful, and more sociable version of Catcher, if here can be such a thing, and much more obviously funny. Charlie's stilted, innocent voice reminded me more of narrator Haddon's Curious incident of the Dog in the Night-time than Holden Caulfield. Laughed a lot. My favorite quotes: ""[My sister] is a part of the Earth Day Club here in high school, and that is where she meets the boys.

And other times you see the same couple, and they make you feel so mad. And all you want is to always feel happy for them because you know that if you do, then it means you're happy too.""

So I got your letters just yesterday and honestly they were a little difficult to follow and it took time to process all of that at once( i swear i don't mean this in a bad way). I won't say you were relatable because you were not and that has nothing to do with you writing all these letters almost 20 years back. It's just that I don't have friends who smoke pot and I also haven't allowed my best friend to kiss me just because I thought they'd feel good after doing it. But at the same time Charlie, you WERE relatable. I can understand you. I understand how it feels like when you're told to 'participate' in stuff and to spend less time in your head. And I can also understand how it must've been to have just your English teacher as a friend on the first day of school. Maybe this is an infp trait or something but I get you. TOTALLY.Everything you wrote was so touching that even after days of reading I still can't wrap my head around how I'm actually feeling and also I have a serious doubt that you somehow peeped into my head before writing all of this but that's impossible. Right?Charlie, you are awesome and you've wonderful people around you and I hope you know and cherish that fact. There's nothing wrong with spending time with just your own thoughts and being your own self because that's okay and I hope you understand that. It's okay to just be and not actively express everything you're feeling. It's okay and people who say otherwise can go live in some hole. It's been a long time so I know that wherever you are, you're participating more in life and feeling infinite.

He's a quirky youngster, one of those kids that just seem to get things the way not many kids get, but at the same time 'not getting it' in the conventional way. I'm so so glad Charlie isn't conventional. He's a thinker, eager to please in a good way. This is a coming of age story that is heartbreaking but at the same time fantastic. I was left with the impression that he would be ok, given the shock at the end which I didn't see coming. And I just really wanted him to be ok as I fell for this character. I have not read a book by Stephen Chbosky before, but I was glad I came across my copy. I think the author really did 'get' the angst of adolescence with a spot on delivery through a quirky guy we get to know as Charlie. Very cool book.I first saw the film, but have only vague memories of it.

VENGHINO SIGNORI!Una breve anteprima di quello che potrete trovare: abuso, malattia, droga, sesso (E Rock'n roll), alcool, suicidio, omosessualità e omofobia, QI verso l'infinito e oltre, musica (ma quella buona eh!), aborto e.. Bon, tutto, giuro. La maggior parte dei quali viene trattato per tre/quattro righe e poi archiviato per far fronte alla successiva patata bollente.. A tal proposito.. THE BECEREST THING è l'epilogo, forse uno dei più brutti, patetici e ""Dai che qui il lettore riesco a farlo commuovere!"" che io abbia mai letto. Sarebbe da andare da Chbosky, legarlo alla sedia e somministrargli Baci Perugina con seguente lettura delle citazioni di Moccia, giusto per fargli provare un po' di disagio esistenziale..Il libro è piatto, si legge veloce ma non lascia niente perché Charlie, oltre ad essere il rincoglionito di cui sopra, è anche irritante, inutile e poco simpatico (ma tutti, tutti, tutti lo adorano. E certo, lo definiscono la 'tappezzeria' perché ""ascolta""..). Gli eventi si susseguono senza senso, è un ammasso di cose messe lì a far presenza e intervallate da Citazioni un sacco belle. Anzi, no: sono le citazioni che sono intervallate ogni tanto da qualche fattarello..Ah quasi dimenticavo. Il libro ha 261 pagine (e lo si legge in un giorno, anche abbastanza pieno di impegni).. Per circa 160, Charlie PIANGE. E non me ne frega niente che è emotivo, io ad un certo punto volevo prendere a mazzate il muro.. ARGH.Show more"

It is my staff rec at work, and I don't want to change it. There are so many things that I love about this book, and here are a couple quotes from it that I love. Actually, many quotes from it that I love. And believe me, I have a ton more. I would sit here and recite the whole book if I could. ""Do you always think this much, Charlie?"" ""Is that bad?"" ""Not necessarily. It's just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life."" ""Is that bad?"" ""Yes.""""I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.""""I don't want to start thinking again. Not like I have this last week. I can't think again. Not ever again.I don't know if you've ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That's why I'm trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.""""Sometimes, I look outside, and I think that a lot of other people have seen this snow before. Just like I think that a lot of other people have read those books before. And listened to those songs.I wonder how they feel tonight.""""So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons.

Downtown. Lights on buildings and everything makes you wonder. Sam sat down and started laughing. Patrick started laughing. I started laughing.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,No Rating,"September 24, 2022",28 likes,0,"#BannedBooksWeekThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is my favorite ""banned book"" of all time. I first read it when I was a senior in high school and I still remember feeling so moved by the authors portrayal of tough topics and emotions that it has stuck with me to this day. I wish I could read this book for the first time and experience it all over again. The book is set in the early 1990's and with so much of 90's nostalgia resurfacing, I think this book should be given new life too. The main character is a teenage boy named Charlie and while I often have a hard time relating to male main characters, I had no problem relating to Charlie and his experiences of high school. Because this is a coming-of-age story about teenagers, there are references to topics such as drugs and abuse, which has frequently landed this story in the ""banned book"" arena. This story is so powerful and moving that I believe it has potential to help those who may have had similar scenarios happen to them or even help spark empathy for those who have not. So much thought and detail went into the writing of this story and has made it unforgettable for so many. It was made into a movie in 2012, but as they typically say, the book was better. You can't quite grasp the same sentiment from Charlie in the movie that you get from reading the book. If you are looking for a book that was banned because of its honesty of tough topics and will pull at your heart, give this one a try. - Sarah K.Although I graduated from high school over twenty years ago, reading the first chapter of The Perks of Being a Wallflower took me right back to that time when I started ninth grade. The insecurity, uncertainty, missing the friends that moved away, seeing how much those a year older than me had grown since I last saw them, and all the new faces, whether teachers or students. Most importantly, where do you sit for lunch? These worries are the same for the main character, Charlie. Life has not been easy for him so far, but will it get better or worse now that he started high school? Get to know Charlie as he writes letters to a “dear friend” throughout his first year about the people he meets, friends he makes, girls he likes or dates, and the new world he finds. There is a word of caution about this book: the author Chbosky wrote about real things. Not of happy fairytales with happy endings, but real life. In Charlie’s life, there is death through suicide and cancer, sex, drugs, and of course, music (not just rock ‘n’ roll). If you have a teen that is in high school, this book could help him/her/they to know that others are not perfect nor are their lives. If you have already graduated high school, like me, this book may bring back some good and maybe not great memories. Best of all, this book allows you to examine your life and realize that being kind is a necessity because you never know what someone else has gone through. Ask someone to have lunch with you or share a seat on the bus/train/tram/trolly or simply offer a smile. It could make his/her/their day. -Dana S.Banned & Challenged Books | Advocacy, Legislation & IssuesShow more"

We meet Charlie shortly after his only friend commits suicide. During the following year, we witness Charlie experience his freshman year of high school, as well as the following firsts: heterosexual kiss, homosexual kiss, girlfriend, fooling around with a girl, cigarettes, weed, alcohol, acid, gay friend, group of friends, and parties. Charlie is also exposed to or has been exposed to an abortion, molestation, incest, a fist fight, a teacher who takes a special interest in him (in a good way, not a creepy way!) dating violence, domestic violence and just about every other after-school-special, very-important-message teen social issue that can be crammed into one 213 page book. It was just too much. In addition to the teen experience overload, this read like a self indulgent personal memoir. It came as no surprise when I discovered that Stephen Chbosky was born in 1970. Charlie himself was hard to get a feel for. We know that he has emotional problems, used to have aggression problems and cries at the drop of a hat. But for all of Charlie’s supposed self-awareness, he never gets to the roots of his introversion, passive-aggressiveness, or social awkwardness. He lets things happen to him, but doesn’t do much to control his own life. Besides Charlie’s non-existent social skills, he had a special sort of naivety that made him seem retarded. I’m not being mean here, he really and truly sounded mentally retarded in many of the passages. p.167 “Did you have a senior prank? I’m guessing you probably did because my sister said it’s a tradition at a lot of schools. This year, the prank was as follows: Some seniors filled the swimming pool with about six thousand packages of grape Kool-Aid. I have no idea who thinks these things or why, except that the senior prank is supposed to signify the end of school. What this has to do with a grape pool is beyond me, but I was very happy not to have gym.”Perhaps this isn’t the best example. But it sounds awfully young for a 16 yr old boy. Many people love this book, so I realize that I am in the minority here. But I can’t help thinking that the appeal is the massive amounts of taboo (for most teens) subject matter in the story. Take away the drugs, sexuality, and occasional mention of a psychiatrist… and there isn’t much of a story left. An ill at ease kid forms a one-way friendship with the only people who extend it to him…. The end. Show more"

I enjoyed the truth or dare scene (though it's hard to imagine it really happening). I liked Patrick's character in particular, his relationships with Sam and with Brad, and the fight in the cafeteria. Although the author tried much too hard to try to come up with clever lines (all of the 'infinite' nonsense), there were some lines that were wonderful. ""We accept the love we think we deserve"" is brilliant, and may have bumped my review from one star to two all by itself. And despite the rest of this review, I was drawn into this story.The narrator, Charlie, is a much more problematic character. We know he is a high school freshman, and an old one, as he gets his drivers license during the school year. But in his letters, he sounds like a much younger child. We are repeatedly told how smart he is, but he doesn't sound like it at all (and for all of the extra essays he writes for his English teacher, his letter writing never improve).But my biggest problem is how misleading the title of the book is, and how it negatively affects the story. On one level it sounds silly to say, but the book does not show any perks to being a wallflower. Every other character is trying to get Charlie to participate in life, to stop being a wallflower. Much more importantly, Charlie is not a wallflower at all. Charlie is a seriously troubled boy. He is haunted by the suicide of a friend, and we later learn, the death of his favorite aunt. And in the final pages, there is a late reveal that I think cheapened and changed the meaning of the entire story. To send the reader into the story with the implication that Charlie is just shy or introverted, when there is something much more serious affecting him, is not cool.I am surprised by the strong feelings I have about this book. I can see myself reading it again someday, to see if my feelings change on a second reading. But I don't think I would recommend it to someone else unless they already knew the ending.Show more"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is one those books that just stays in your heart no matter what. The type of book that will open up your mind to social issues that everyone has been going through. The thing about this novel is that it tackled everything starting from drugs, premarital sex, rape, child abuse, HIV awareness and same sex relationships. If that's not enough reason for you to read it, then I don't know what is.Charlie's character is so relatable. He may be stupid and insensitive at times but I like the fact that he was always there to listen to his friends whenever they needed someone to talk to. He was too innocent for his own good to the point of hilariousness.It's my first time reading an epistolary fiction and it was great! The MC decided to write down his thoughts in order to sort out the chaos going on inside his head. As the story goes on you could easily see that Charlie is suffering from PTSD, anxiety and depression. You would see how his friends and family played a huge role when it comes to his ordeal.

That's at least what happened to me. I've read this one a young age which made me gain a lot of understanding for mental illness before I got ill myself. The characters and the situations they find themselves in feel so real. It feels like you're the one who's getting all the letters Charlie is writing and it made the reading experience incredible. The portrayal of mentall illness is exactly the way it should be. It doesn't seem like the author doesn't know what he's writing about, it's simply realistic.

It explores themes of adolescence, friendship mental health and abuse and does so very subtly, while going through the flow of the plot.My problem with the book was how Charlie sounded autistic sometimes, instead of being a wallflower.

Couldn't stand the writing, the main character, or the story. Update; 3-16-13I just watched the movie and....I kind of, um...loved it.  I'm gonna be picking this up again because the movie was so good. After Finishing3.5 StarsI honestly don't know what to think of this book. I started reading it a long time ago and stopped because I didn't like the story or the writing. Then the movie came out, and I watched it, and I fell in love with it. So I decided to give the book another try. I don't know. This is a difficult book to review. I sympathize with Charlie. Yes, he's a crybaby. Yes, he's naive. There's a reason for this. This might not be true but this is my interpretation of Charlie.Charlie is autistic. He's incredibly smart but he doesn't know it. He doesn't know how to deal with things like friends and people and masturbating because he's always been ignored in his family except for his aunt Helen. And everyone who's read the book knows how that turned out. Charlie is awkward, shy, a bit strange, and is mentally unstable. Autism was officially made a special education exceptionality in 1991, which is actually the year this story took place. Charlie's parents either ignored the fact that their child was strange in an unhealthy way or they just didn't think it would be a disability. Or it must not have been a big thing back then as it is so quickly recognized nowadays. Maybe its because I have two autistic brothers is the reason I noticed it and forgave Charlie for being so naive and a crybaby. Still, most autistic boys aren't that naive. Charlie's symptoms (shyness, the lack of ability to 'participate', and his incredibly intelligent academic mind) are closely related to Asberger's syndrome. My eldest brother has this same problem. He doesn't talk to people only if it is absolutely necessary. He's extremely dependent on our parents. He is so smart that he got into his college on scholarship and barely had to study in order to get A's in most of his classes, but he doesn't know how to socialize with people and hates being even in the presence of a lot of people. I found Charlie to be like this, although my brother never cries. I'm not sure Chbosky gave Charlie enough credit (if he is even supposed to have autism) as a person with a mental disability. Sometimes Charlie would be far too outgoing for an autistic person and other times, he would be too sensitive to be an autistic person. I'm not completely sure if this is just because Charlie isn't meant to be autistic, just a traumatic child, or it's because Chbosky's never had a first hand look at someone who has Asbergers. I live with two people with it (and one of them has many other forms of autism much more severe than just Asbergers.) so I sympathized with Charlie even if he wasn't the best example for an autistic person. If you were to ask me which I preferred, the movie or the book, I would say the movie.For me, when I was watching the movie, I felt inspired and moved and I really felt for the characters. I even started crying at one point for Charlie. Whilst in the book, it was good, but I just felt indifferent towards it. The writing style really aggravated me as well. If Chbosky had written it differently, maybe it would have been a better book.I liked how, in the book, they focused more on the familial issues instead of just the friendship ones (which they focused a lot on in the movie and kind of left out the family scenes). I was disappointed to find they left out a major part in the movie that was in the book. When Charlie's sister got pregnant and he went with her to get the abortion. That was a huge bonding moment between the two, and it sucks that they cut it out of the movie.It was a good story at times, occasionally got far too monotonous for my taste, but it was alright. I have mixed feelings for it. Show more"

This is the kind of book that touched me deep down. Charlie is just a child, he writes down in a very simple way, but his words are powerful.
“I would die for you. But I won't live for you”
At first, Charlie is an outcast, he is lonely and has been through a lot emotionally speaking. He had to face his loving aunt's death when he was 7 and had to stay for a while in a psychiatric hospital to deal with this loss. Then, just before going to high school, his best friend Michael killed himself. He goes back to dark places and he starts this new year all by himself, he knows no one and that it won't be easy to make new friends. This is how he begins to write letters for someone who will be called ""Dear Friend"" during all the book and someone we know nothing about. I noticed that Charlie grew up a lot during this year, we can see that especially with the way he writes, the way he thinks, but also with the subjects he broaches. I found a gif online the other day when I was reading the first half of this book, and this gif just made me think about Charlie.I can't really explain why, because maybe to me he is kind of childish and gullible and who he admires simple things and that they can make him happy. But as the book moves on, we get to see darker parts of him. How violent he could be, how traumatized he sometimes seems. Only a few persons seem to make it right to him. - Family: His sister, even if she is selfish at the beginning of the book, we can truly see how she loves him. His brother, that isn't really present but matters a lot. He loves his parents also, but he especially keeps loving his dead aunt Helen, he keeps visiting her grave, remembering how she made him feel special. - Friends: He succeeded to make friends in a kind of random way, but they are very important to him. There is Patrick (and I have to admit that I really loved this character) but more importantly, there is Sam, Charlie's great love. Patrick is gay, Patrick is completely at ease with his homosexuality, and he is Sam's stepbrother. Sam has, according to Charlie's sister, a low self-esteem. She falls in love with people who eventually end up hurting her.When she asks Charlie how that always happen to her, he just answer my favorite quote ever
“We accept the love we think we deserve”
(This quote has actually been said by his English teacher, Bill who has a very important role in this book. He is the one that gives Charlie new books, but also the only adult who Charlie can openly talk to. But I preferred the moment he said it to Sam, that is why I explained that moment)At the end of the book, Charlie realize that he was molested by his Aunt Helen and that is probably why was acting weird sometime. I have to admit, I was so shocked to learn about that. I really grew feelings for this loving aunt and I was feeling bad for Charlie's grief. It's probably what the author aimed, he wanted to make us understand that it happens more often than we think and that even close persons such as parents, siblings and so on can be a 100% oblivious to that molestation. I feel both very sad and very happy for Charlie at the end of the book. He ends up alone all over again and learned that the person he remembered as the person he loved the most was actually abusing him, but he seems better to have understood what happened to him. I actually feel Bittersweet.I watched the movie as soon as I finished this book, cause I didn't have enough of it and I was afraid that I misunderstood some parts of it. I can now shelf it as one of my favourite book (and it makes me think about Charlie every time he read a book)

En The Perks of Being a Wallflower nos encontramos a un chico de quince años, socialmente inadaptado y con problemas de autoestima, que se enfrenta a la secundaria. No sé por qué sujetos como Charlie logran ser tan populares en la literatura. O sea, la moda era ser un marginado, sin amigos, un adolescente tímido que al conocerlo resultaba en un ser maravilloso, con una perspectiva muy peculiar sobre las cosas. El personaje principal de esta historia me ha parecido un ser muy ingenuo, demasiado para ser real. Algunas veces su inocencia me llevaría a poner carita de cachorro adorable, porque de verdad que era adorable algunas veces; pero la mayoría del tiempo su personalidad era irritante, ya que su poco conocimiento sobre la vida lo dejaba mal parado. Hay algunas cosas que no cuadran en la historia de Charlie, porque a mí me ha parecido como alguien con un tipo de autismo. Pero eso no se menciona en el libro. El autor le describe como un marginado: alguien retraído, callado y que no se ha integrado plenamente a la sociedad. Pero a Charlie le va muy bien en la escuela, y siempre obtiene buenas notas: hasta dicen que es muy inteligente, a pesar de su corta edad. Y yo me pregunto: ¿Cómo alguien como él no sabría lo que es la masturbación? ¿Cómo alguien tan inteligente como Charlie no sabría reconocer una escena de abuso sexual, siendo él uno de los testigos de dicha escena?Dramatización -o algo así-:Charlie: *Ve a un chico y una chica entrar a su cuarto y comenzar a besarse como locos*Charlie: *Ve al chico obligar a su novia hacerle sexo oral*¿Entienden mi punto?Otro aspecto del libro que me lleva a no ponerme más de dos estrellas es la manera en la que el autor trata los temas expuestos en su obra. Aquí hay bastante tela que cortar, porque este libro habla sobre abuso sexual, violencia de género, la homosexualidad, traumas por abuso infantil.... en fin. Estos abundan. Pero lo que no me gusta es que el autor sólo habla de ellos en una escena particular para evidenciar que todos los personajes tenían problemas. Él sólo habla del abuso sexual cuando cierto personaje sufre de eso; pero no pasan cómo los personajes han solucionado esos problemas. Sólo es superficial su desarrollo. Y para ser una novela que conlleva muchos problemas, muchos temas de interés, me parece que el desarrollo de estos fue muy pobre. La escritura me pareció muy simple y pretenciosa, a pesar de que fue el primer libro en formato epistoral que leí. El hecho de que Charlie no supiera reconocer una situación de abuso y que tendiera a callar sobre estas me pareció preocupante. Y que sus amigos lo drogaran fue aún peor. Estos son aspectos que DEBIERON haber sido supervisados por adultos, por los padres de Charlie, y no ser tomados con un simple ¡Qué pervertido, Charlie! y con risitas de complicidad. Pero como siempre, el control parental es bastante mínimo en el género Young Adult.Mi segunda vez con este libro no ha sido lo que esperaba, en lo absoluto. The Perks of Being A Wallflower es un libro muy hipster para mi gusto, que no alcanza a tener ese toque emocional que busco. Demasiado pretencioso y sobrevalorado. PD: Si Charlie estuviera en Goodreads, seguro le daría cinco estrellas a todos los libros, así que sería poco confiable su criterio. JA.Show more"

Yes, I'm!I completed this book today itself, so it's still fresh in my mind and again I literally loved it.When I started reading it, to me Charlie's character was so much relatable, not in a way that I did drugs, or smoked or because I got free books from my teacher(because I'm autistic, no I'm not, talking about free books I don't even get them on my birthdays, poor me :/) or not even that I saw people having sex in front of me when I was 15, no, not really. No such opportunities I came across.But what I thought was relatable to me, were his thoughts, they were so pure, true, and unadulterated and then this book had these situations that we all might have come across during the time when we were growing up, when we were exploring things, trying to fit in and developing, that made me like this book so much. This book speaks to people and I was amazed while reading this book, that how often I had same thoughts, I liked how writer talked about every possible sphere of teenagers life: family drama, friends, first date, first kiss, complicated relationships, fights, not being honest about feelings, then hurting people, loving people, siblings(their love, hate relationship), parent's family, cousins, teachers, university, cheating, masturbation, sex, drugs,getting stoned, football, graduation, books, movies, songs...what not, everything.I liked the character of Charlie, such a sweet boy, and I liked how he improves throughout the book, learns to write more skillfully and how he was always there for his friends, I liked it, a lot and then how he noticed everything about everything, how he was good at listening to people and then how he had so many questions to ask, all the time, so many thoughts, how much he loved his family. I liked that he made tapes for people,made tapes according to mood, how he gifted people the things that mattered to them the most and how he put those complicated thoughts into words(yes,I know the writer did) but seriously I liked everything.I liked his friends as well, good people. Like it happens in the case of friendships,here as well there was this downfall, but then there was love between them, which brought them closer and stronger than before.The reason I liked this book so much, because it was about a wallflower, an outsider, which I always consider myself since my childhood. And this book got me,it actually touched me in a very subtle way, that I can't explain.I also liked how music, and books were well discussed. I love reading, I love making tapes according to moods and seasons and well all this was there in the book and I appreciated it a lot. Show more"

Éste, en cambio, es parte de esos libros que dejaron algo real, algo especial en ti, y que sabes que te acompañarán por el resto de tu vida. Siento que con palabras no puedo hacerle justicia, no podría describir nunca lo que me hizo sentir.El protagonista, Charlie, es un chico que en la historia tiene entre 15 y 16 años, y está comenzando a vivir la vida, está experimentando muchas cosas por vez primera, y todo parece muy extraño, pero lógico, desde su punto de vista que de análisis no carece. Charlie ha sufrido mucho desde su infancia, ha vivido experiencias que le han dejado marcas imborrables, con los recuerdos de éstas más que sentirse orgulloso por recordarlas a pesar del tiempo transcurrido, son de esas memorias que se deberían empaquetar juntas y luego echarlas al fuego, para permitirle seguir adelante.Sam y Patrick son sus nuevos amigos, los que lo ayudan a involucrarse a este mundo del cuál él ha estado tan apartado, con ellos conoce nuevas personas, nuevos lugares, nuevas maneras de vivir la vida, y obtiene un significado, aunque tácito, de la palabra infinito.Al terminarlo, en silencio, sólo pude pensar en que a veces le doy mucha importancia a lo que sucede a mi alrededor, cuando, como diría Charlie, hay personas que también arrastran tragedias, y puede que sean tres mil veces peores. No sé cómo explicárselos, pero éste es ese libro que sientes que estaba escrito para que lo leyeras.A todos los que no se han animado a sumergirse en el mundo de Charlie, les invito a que lo hagan, porque con sus anécdotas, recuerdos, experiencias y puntos de vista, te sentirás infinito.Querido Charlie:Estoy de acuerdo con tu tía Helen y con Bill.

Nostalgia aside, I did appreciate the wide range of life that was touched upon within these pages, including both the hard topics and the trivial, but at the end of the reading, I was left feeling that the narrator was just a tad too immature for a fifteen year old. If he was twelve or eleven, then perhaps most of the novel may have been a cohesive whole, skipping the passages of the first date or his other fumbling attempts.Granted, the surprise ending did shine a much better light upon the rest of the text, but even so, his retiring intellectual acumen could have easily let him work through even his level of immaturity. The fact is, the narrator was too advanced in some ways to be so ignorant of his other shortcomings, and that is despite the end's recoloring of the events.Are we working with a novel about a shy and retiring young man more interesting in perceiving the world rather than living it, or are we dealing with the natural consequence of early molestation? On the one hand, I'm down with with the feel and treatment of the novel, save my previous complaint, but on the other hand, it implies that all introverts must have been molested or otherwise had gone through some trauma that made them that way.It's not like introverts couldn't be traumatized by life, itself, could it? No, no, that would never do as a novel. Lol.Despite this, i did think the novel was charming.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58882300-wera,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"February 15, 2021",24 likes,0,"3 starsThis is one of those books where I acknowledge the authorial choices, I see why they make some other readers feel 'seen' and whatnot, but they simply did not work for me. Charlie is a freshman who has been going through life while not really living. This all changes when Charlie encounters grief and violence. Now he confides this information in an unnamed recipient of his letters (my personal interpretation is that you the reader are this recipient). This is a raw book. But where some may really like this aspect, I didn't mesh with it was well as I would have wanted to. Before I continue, here are a few quotes that I think are important (not just in the book but in life): “And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have. Good and bad.”“Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.”“We accept the love we think we deserve.”“I would die for you. But I won't live for you.""A big thing going for this book is that it contextualises important ideas (or at least what I perceive them to be). You can empathise with other peoples' suffering, but do their feelings minimise the ones that you feel? People accept the treatment they think they deserve, not the type they need. Why is this? Why do people go on like that when they should be getting into much better situations? How do we deal with grief and loneliness? I don't know. Thing is, the author doesn't either. Chbosky didn't really go into much detail about the multitude of social issues he brings up for a snappy cameo.Another personal qualm that I had with the text was the writing style. This is an epistolary novel, which is fine (I enjoy those too), but it is written from the point of view of an emotionally distant main character. Living in the moment, doing things, and just living are huge parts of Charlie's journey. His sentences are choppy, his writing is overly blunt, which is what you would probably expect from a letter written by a 14/15 year old. Unfortunately, those two things detracted from my enjoyment of the novel. This is a wonderful example of where character detachment and choppy prose causes me to also feel detached from him and the story. An example of where this wasn't the case was when I read The Catcher in the Rye where the main character Holden also struggles with the entire 'carpe diem' thing but it is done in a different way. The novel is also told in first person point of view but Holden talks about the recent past in, mostly, one chunk (unlike Charlie who sends multiple letters so you very much feel like you're part of the story) and the language is made such that a detachment is created meanwhile keeping the interesting prose. I understand why so many people relate to this style of text. It does feel like you are corresponding with Charlie, which is wonderful, but didn't work for me.Something that is really nagging me is the neglect of the various social issues brought up. To some extent, I understand that the reason for this. He is a teenager, of course his letters will not contain an intense discourse on the ethics of drug abuse/rape/etc but the issues are swept under the rug and forgotten very quickly. I could have let most of these things slide, except for the fact that as I opened the page for this book on Goodreads and I read that part of the pitch for this book is that Charlie deals with his friends suicide. ... what? For a minute I forgot this was even how the book started! This isn't a book about suicide! It was in that moment, that I realised how the author probably didn't want to commit to such a grave topic. The other issues, sure it is realistic that Charlie would have dismissed them, but your only friend killing himself is something that should traumatise a child. Instead, it is passed off as an incendiary event. By now you may be wondering, why I am rating this book a 3. From my review, it would be likely to assume this to be a 2-2.5 star read. Initially it was in that range. Then I read the afterword. I liked it. It made me realise a few things about the book. Though I still think it unrealistic that the kid who writes the way he writes would get full A grades, I did notice that the writing periodically improved as the plot progressed. I saw the impact that the story made on me towards the end: as Charlie started to really live, I started connecting with him more. So when in the afterword Charlie says that it is ok and that he ""made it"", I realised that with this new lens, the book gets another layer, a thought hit me that I did at least enjoy this book somewhat.Do I think this is a must read? No. Will I reread this? No. But I am glad that I did read it. It truly had a few beautiful scenes:

And instead of feeling pain, I felt like I was thrown into that cold snow ground where Charlie was found blue and asleep. I am cold, dead. How tragic, indeed, it is to look around me and see things, even the things I don't want to see. And can't do anything about it. How sorrowful to notice things I want to change and then can't do anything about them anyway.My Honest ReviewI don't really know what else to say about this book aside from what had been said already. The book is fantastic, an easy read, affectionate, moving and every imaginable great adjective one can use in or about a book. They were all telling the truth.I also read a review (a bad review actually), saying she felt like Charlie talks like a seven year old kid. I must agree with her too. because maybe Charlie is just seven. He was seven when his world seemed stopped revolving. He was seven when his aunt Helen died. And maybe since then, he never really grew up. It seems like he was caged in his horrible past, and it was so horrible, he just kind of blocked that part of his memory out. He couldn't remember it, and how do we expect him to move on from being seven when he doesn't even remember being seven? Anyway, I said above, this is MY honest review and I keep talking about other's reviews. Well, for me, the book is entirely great. The message it conveys will forever stay with me. The lessons it taught me will surely help me forever. I will forever be grateful being Charlie's friend and that he sent me his letters, in other words, he trusted me with all his heart and mind and soul. And that is saying something.Nice choice of books, music, TV shows and movies too. Salute to the author.And that suicidal poem is just brilliant. I mean it's brilliant including it in the book. Though Charlie wasn't really THAT suicidal, but his friend Michael did.This is the one of the best books I've read.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29384668-antonio,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"July 5, 2020",24 likes,0,"“It's strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book.” There are many books I've read that were so important to me during some phases that I couldn't help writing a review about them. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of them: a comfort reading I'll probably always be able to relate to. With an almost epistolary style, in which Chbosky presents us Charlie, a boy writing a diary telling us about his life. As a teen, living in the most complex and confusing period of life, the protagonist transit among the adult universe, the teenage universe, the familiar universe and isolation. Charlie often analyses everything that surrounds him, since he is a shy boy who doesn't know how to interact with people and who is afraid of rejection (ain't we all?).Despite his shyness, Charlie has problems in dealing with his anger - as most of the teenagers. He even beats up a bully and tries to hurt himself in some occasions. I couldn't help remember the Freudian concept that death is the goal of life, on account of the return to the inanimate state where the Ego can't be hurt. Charlie directs this desire towards himself, with self-destructive behaviours, and also towards others through aggression and violence.He is also a broken person. His best friend has committed suicide, and the only person he could relate to in his family has died in a tragic accident. He was abandoned by the two people who understood him. He was left alone in a family whose ties were weak and superficial; Charlie even complains that his parents enjoy more time drinking and betting with strangers than acquainting themselves about his children lives.As any broken person, Charlie isolates himself. He finds shelter in his books, his music and his letters to an unknown addressee. Running away to the pages of his novels seems like a great solution to the problems of life, especially while listening to The Smiths, with all its intimism. His writing works as a relief valve, where he could either organise all the mess inside his head or even admit this on the paper, finally making them real while tattooing them with ink in the purity of paper.“I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.” Fortunately, Charlie encounters two amazing people in high school, Patrick and Sam, who made him part of a group and encourage him to participate more - two lighthouses which illuminate the mist of solitude surrounding the protagonist. Besides them, one of Charlie's teachers has a significant role in his growing. Bill, his literature professor, sees the teen's talents and encourages him to improve his abilities, take more mature decisions and participate more in life. Charlie sees Bill has an example of an adult, an essential figure to any teen growing up.Finally, after all this miscellany of ideas I wasn't able to organise any better - there are just so many thoughts about this book! -, I must say why this book is so important to me. The difficulties of growing up and trying to fit are so magnificently well-written by Stephen Chbosky that it hurts. Besides that, his isolation is viscerally relatable: music, writing, books. Anything to avoid reality or make it more tolerable. As one my friends says: ""After all, who doesn't read to escape?"" Chbosky really created a wonderful book anyone can relate to.“I am both happy and sad at the same time, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.” Show more"

Mr. Chbosky's treatment of sexuality and sex is also well-done, as growing up is all about discovering this. Charlie is a quirky, but not uncommon kid; and his love for Sam, Patrick, his sister, brother and family is also beautifully detailed. I also enjoyed the film version of this book very much.

Rating: 5 stars
I just reread the quotes I typed into my phone for this review as a refresher (because, no, it definitely hasn't been three weeks since I read this) and they punched me straight in the heart. I was rethinking my love for this book as I, for three weeks, kept trying to force myself to write this review. Turns out that was unnecessary! I really freakin' love the prose here. Chbosky captures that certain nostalgia that comes with every classic, and it makes this novel feel like reading on a snow day with a candle lit and a mug of hot chocolate and a fuzzy blanket wrapped around you. In a sentence that isn't a run-on, this book feels so comforting.WE ALL NEED A BILL IN OUR LIVES.Charlie is such a special narrator, so I will undoubtedly talk about him soon. But one of the notes in my phone is of my new favorite book scene ever, when Charlie has lunch at Bill's house. I love this relationship and Bill as this role model figure for Charlie throughout the book. Bill is the one who tells Charlie to start participating in life, and gives him books to read and the assignment to write about them. I think we all need a person who will encourage us introverts to live. What Bill does doesn't seem so big, but I haven't been able to shake this one thing:
Then, he asked me about girls, and I told him how I really loved Sam, and how I wondered what the lady who wrote The Fountainhead would say about how I came to realize that I loved her.
This is such a huge development for Charlie. He used to live in books and now he sees this book as it relates to his own life and to his own actions. He's not living in the book, the book exists in his world now. The Perks of Being a Wallflower consistently drops names of well-known classics. And, at least for me, it takes a lot to truly understand how these novels are affecting Charlie's life. That quote, for example, means a lot more when you know Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism. In other words, Rand would probably not like that Charlie came to realize he loved Sam when Charlie found out that all he wanted was for her to be happy. Because that is not individualism, that's living for someone else. It felt good to understand some references to the classics like this. Maybe you didn't need to read The Fountainhead to understand it, but it's just another way that this book at first glance seems like a 213 page novella, and then Charlie says things like this and suddenly it's larger than The Fountainhead itself. I love that Bill is able to encourage Charlie to come out of himself. While it may lead him to some messy habits, ultimately the advice Bill gives to Charlie to participate changes his whole life for the better. Hats off to you, Bill.WE ACCEPT THE LOVE WE THINK WE DESERVE.This book is tricky. The straightforward and simple prose can be quite deceiving. If you don't try at all when reading this, it can feel like Chbosky made Charlie's voice naive and it can all come across as somehow condescending. This book, like Charlie hears about The Catcher in the Rye, is whatever you make it. For me, it was a story of a young boy who learned to participate in his life. And it felt so truthful. Charlie doesn't give the reader the most detailed descriptions here. Things are often described as ""strange"" and there are enough uses of ""very"" to make 100 English teachers' red pens die out. But because of this, Charlie's voice feels genuine. There is so much between the lines here, just as there is so much more to a person than what they tell you. Charlie isn't super self-aware, but he is always thoughtful. I got the most out of his character here, but I get the impression that if I were to reread this a few months from now, I'd learn something entirely different, from a character maybe not even mentioned in this review. For 213 pages, there is so much to analyze.I'M SORRY, IS THIS MY LIFE?Chbosky shines in capturing those little family moments. Watching a big brother succeed on the football field, driving to a family Thanksgiving. These things seem like such tiny moments, and I guess they are, but they are parts of life that only a narrator like Charlie can get right. These family moments felt like they were stolen right from my heart. It just amazes me how this book could be so relevant to my life. I really did feel like I was Charlie for large parts of this book.It needs to be said that I didn't appreciate the proposition that abortion has no after affect. That you can go home and say you went to McDonald's and a movie and that is the end of that. Still, I loved this book. It felt like the truest parts of growing up. The car rides to family parties full of arguments, watching your big brother's game tape with the whole family; these are moments of life that Chbosky captures so truthfully and I loved it. So that's what this book meant to me: family and participating. And if that doesn't appeal to you, want to know the honest truth? It'll mean something completely different to you. The only consistency is that The Perks of Being a Wallflower will shake something deep in your core if you look a little harder, and if you allow it.Show more"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower doesn’t tackle anything new… drugs, music, sexuality etc have all been dealt with in other books, this book just sets itself apart for me because the protagonist while being absolutely honest is also absolutely naïve. I have no real reason to like him. Other than his being… absolutely honest. BUT it is was also this honesty that had me doubting his authenticity. The book is written in letter form to an un-named friend. With each letter, Charlie recounts with absolute honesty the things that he’s seen and done and the people he has met and become friends with (after school specials do not have anything on this kid‘s life.) And yet, I can honestly say that I was never as naïve as Charlie was when I was fifteen.  Perhaps this can be explained away by the fact that he is not an average fifteen year old. He is mentally unstable given a trauma suffered early in his life So despite this Mary Sue of a lead, I read on. And enjoyed myself. Wha..? How? Well, among the people who take him under their wing are Sam and Patrick. One, I loved the matter of fact treatment of the latter’s sexuality all the while being contrasted to the sexuality issues of another. Two, it is this group that manages to sound more real than Charlie does. They read poetry, they hang out in cool places, they drink, they smoke… in an attempt to be cool. Isn’t that what most teenagers do anyway? Show more"

Hit my sweet spot of being depressing and life-affirming at once. What sticks in my mind is Charlie's voice. I love unreliable narrators and Charlie is one of the most unreliable, but for all that he is maddeningly passive and acts the victim (yes, I think you can both be a victim and act the victim), he is kind of an extraordinary character and extraordinarily sweet. The voice is almost willfully ignorant in the way I think we are in our teen years, ignoring everything and everyone that we do not prioritize in our primal, hive-minds. The epistolary format doesn't add anything, but it doesn't detract anything either, so I'm mostly neutral on it. Throughout Wallflower we know that Charlie suffers from something beyond ennui-induced depression. Chbosky moves the grand reveal of the cause of Charlie's mental illness to the epilogue, which I find incredibly gutsy. I'm not convinced it works because it comes way too late for the reader to process it. It is just a blind-side and then the story ends; however, I think it's admirable how Chbosky refuses to let Perks wallow in Charlie's ""secret."" Show more"

Charlie’s voice was quite beautiful. I just think I was expecting another conclusion, and was unfortunately a bit underwhelmed if I am being honest. It doesn’t help that this book is so famous and still talked about a lot today, so my expectations were a bit high. I read the Catcher in the Rye for the first time this year, and I am still recovering from this one, which really touched me. I really dislike that I am making this comparison right now, but maybe it just means that this space in my heart is taken for now. It is quite interesting that it is never mentioned in the book that Charlie may be on the autism spectrum. But also, there is no need to put a label on everything.

There was a time in my own life, when I was around the same age as Charlie, the lead in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, where I was a complete outsider looking into a friendship group I was never made to feel a part of. Recently moved from another country, without friends and slightly immature than the group of individuals that were charged with the responsibility of helping me settle into my high school, was daunting. High school is one of the scariest experiences of your life, you can either sink or swim. Stephen Chbosky’s book helps the reader, young or old, connect with this rite of passage, with Charlie, a rather passive lead.I chose The Perks of Being a Wallflower as it seemed to slot in nicely to my selection of book bingo 2018, this round I need to cover a square titled, a book that became a movie. Stephen Chbosky’s 1999 release was made into a major motion picture in 2012, starring Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. Chbosky was involved heavily in the making of the film based on his novel, turning his hand to directing, screenwriting and producing the film. Although I am yet to watch the film version of the book, I am going to seek it out very soon based on my appreciation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower.There is no doubt that The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a cult classic, paving the way for more recent young adult books that taken inspiration from this title. I believe The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great place to start if you want to investigate the origins of the young adult genre. The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes an unusual format, the book is told in the entire narrative voice of Charlie, a high school freshman (aged 15) in Pittsburgh in the US, who divulges his year at school in the form of letters. The letters are addressed to an unknown recipient and begins with ‘Dear friend’. We never find out the identity of who the letters are intended for. I took it as an intimate relationship between myself and Charlie. As a result, I received an insight into the mind of this teenager, his thoughts, fears, loves and experiences. The tone of the letters or narrative voice of Charlie is straightforward and introspective.The main feature of the book that seemed to work for me was the supporting characters. Namely the seniors that befriend Charlie, Sam and Patrick, along with the English Teacher. I could connect to the English teacher relationship, I too had a great English teacher in high school who inspired my love of reading. I loved the literary references peppered throughout the novel, from To Kill a Mockingbird, On the Road, to Catcher in the Rye. I also appreciated to nostalgia that came from the era in which The Perks of Being a Wallflower is set, the 1990’s. Consequently, we are treated to times past, a world of mix tapes and Nirvana. Chbosky made me miss this time in my life!It was interesting to note that while I was researching the details on this book and film, I came across a surprising fact. The Perks of Being a Wallflower was once banned, removed from the school curriculum in the US for ‘encouragement to lead a destructive lifestyle’. The book does contain moments of light and semblance, but it is issue based. Readers will find serious issues are touched on, perhaps a few too many to examine in great depth. In Charlie’s life he comes across situations of teen suicide (the opener), domestic abuse, sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, mental illness, alcohol and drug abuse. Teens and older readers will be able to connect with these themes, despite the absence of more recent issues such as social media and cyber bullying. It is important that books of the young adult genre put these experiences forward, rather than bury them under the carpet.I tend to have an awkward relationship with the young adult genre, especially more recent books. It seems the older I get the bigger the gap and the distance I feel between my ability to connect with the themes presented in the particular book. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, perhaps due to the time period in which it is set, a time where I too experienced my own ‘coming of age’, allowed me to find some connection to this book. I did find that there could have been more depth to the themes and characters. However, the format of this book seems to lend to a less intensive examination of the issues and protagonists. The Perks of Being a Wallflower seems to be a permanent fixture on top 100 book charts since it was been released, which has led it to be classified as a cult classic. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a good starting point if you want to look at the inception of the popular young adult genre. For readers aged 14+.Show more"

I remember buying this book on my high school gradutation trip at Harrods. During that trip I also bought Let It Snow by John Green – can you tell that 18 y/o me had impeccable taste? :D Anyways, I recall reading it twice that year and absolutely loving it. It was one of my first novels in an epistolary format and I found most of the characters and their struggles relatable. The reveal of Charlie's abuse through his aunt was really shocking to me back in the day and also one of the first instances were I was confronted with such issues in fiction. I would love to reread this book one day, unfortunately, in a fit of my unhauling mania in 2018, I got rid of my copy. I recently found a German translation in an open library but if I'm honest with myself, I would prefer to read it in the original again. Let's see. ***Set in the early 1990s, the novel follows Charlie, an introverted and observant child, through his freshman year of high school in a Pittsburgh suburb. The novel details Charlie's unconventional style of thinking as he navigates between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and attempts to deal with poignant questions spurred by his interactions with both his friends and family. 
“We accept the love we think we deserve.”
Throughout the 1991–1992 academic year, Charlie, the fifteen-year-old (later sixteen-year-old) protagonist, begins writing letters about his own life to an unknown recipient addressed, ""dear friend."" In these letters, he discusses his freshman year of high school and his struggles with two traumatic experiences: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen. Although he is a wallflower, Charlie is befriended by two seniors: Patrick and Sam. Patrick is secretly dating Brad, a football player, and Sam is Patrick's stepsister. Through these characters topics such as homosexuality & homophobia, sexual abuse, drugs, growing up, loving & losing people are introduced. Theirs is one of the most iconic of literary friendships. I recall watching the movie, starring Emma Watson and Ezra Miller (back when he wasn't such a controversial figure), and being absolutely enamoured with them. The scene in which they ride their car through the tunnel is ingrained in my memory forever. 
“And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”

The Perks Of Being A Wallflower does that. But it's told in such an unemotional way, I quite frankly don't give a damn.A lot of my problems come back to the narration. Charlie our main character is innocent to the point of stupid. And I know that time changed a lot since the book was written and people changed with it, but I just couldn't bring myself to believe in or like Charlie.I am not a social butterfly. I would say I'm a Wallflower too. Charlie though? As other reviewers pointed out he isn't exactly a wallflower. He made friends instantly. He trusts people instantly. So in that regard I fail to connect with him, despite expectations. He's more clueless than anything else.Then there's the writing. I hated it. Don't get me wrong, there are some nice quotes in there. But aside from them, the writing is choppy and too simple for my taste. I like diversity and I know that (though I think it wasn't confirmed) Charlie had autism. That gives the writing style an excuse, but even through that I should have felt something, anything for the character. I didn't.Also, I didn't think I'll ever say this however the amount of abuse in the book was very strange. No, I don't think the world is a place full of rainbows and unicorns. I also don't think abuse is the kind of thing you can only write a sentence about and then forget about it. Every time abuse was mentioned to have happened to somebody, there was barely any actual dealing with it. It was like the book was either trying to be more serious or emotional with throwing random abuse cases in. In my case: I liked it less for it.Plus there was the fact that the book simply bored me. I didn't like its characters, I didn't get the hype and the story didn't interest me. Not much left to be reading for.All In All: Was this book for me? No. It's a coming of age story about discovering the world outside your head. In another book, I could have related to that. Sadly, I didn't in here. I liked the movie though.Show more"

I always heard about how amazing this book is from Goodreads and the book-tube community. I tried to love it.. I wanted to love it as much as them. But I couldn't!!I have some points to explain why I didn't enjoy this book. SO hear me out, please.1. I actually liked the idea of writing the book as letters to the reader. He called us ""friends"", but the book itself is so poorly written. Although it is narrated by a teenager, it felt like it was for children.And it turned out to be so boring. Disappointment.Charlie's writing read so young and poor and I thought he had difficulties in learning.. yet he always got the highest grades. That is confusing. How?!Maybe that is because of autism. I am clueless. 2. This is supposed to be a coming of age book about Charlie, a 15 year old boy, who is a shy teenager at the beginning. Then he spent his time with friends drinking, smoking, taking drugs and having sex. His parents don't notice this change. I can not imagine that!And all of his friends are older than him. Well, I can not imagine that, either! For normal teenagers, it is hard to have friends who are all older than you. I didn't have any older friends till college, and even popular ones couldn't do that. So, for a teenager with autism I find it more and more difficult.3. A melodramatic issue book. The book is so short, yet it tries to discuss many issues as death, domestic abuse, sexual abuse/rape, incest, homosexuality, fights, drug abuse and suicide. It was so fast paced to cover all these but also felt so rushed.4. The author tried hard to make you cry. Every character in this book cried at some point trying to make you cry. Death > CRY! , Rape > Come on, you have to CRY!But this didn't move me at all. I didn't shed a single tear. It felt so dry or I am so emotionless! Overall, this was boring. I didn't care about anyone and I felt nothing. Thank you.Show more"

This book is still good and Charlie has a strong voice. It has deep themes, discusses trauma and mental health in a good way. I'm sure it was a very important book for the 1990s that influenced a lot of the more recent YA contemporary we've been getting and for that I'm glad. But that's pretty much it.Show more"

I understand that some might find a message (perhaps even messages) in it and/or that some can find it touching because of the themes it deals with. I personally think that the author included those 'difficult' themes to emotionally blackmail readers into liking this book, but hey maybe that’s just me. If someone found The Perks of Being a Wallflower inspiring, I understand. What I don’t understand is how this book can be so popular. This book does not only contain some of the worst writing I have ever seen in my life, this book might just be the worst writing I have ever read. The writing style is a clear rip off from The Catcher in the Rye but beside plagiarism, it is also incredibly tiring. There are so many other issues to be found in this one, from character development to plot, this novel is a complete disaster. I should have trusted my gut feeling. Giving up after reading those first opening sentences, would have been the right thing to do, but alas instead I went on to waste several hours of my life reading something that is as best a poor excuse for a novel. What I didn’t like about this book? Well, if you really want to know, better sit down and pour yourself some coffee, for this will take a while. I DIDN’T LIKE THE WAY THE NARRATOR (CHARLIE) SOUNDED LIKE A CHILDFirst of all, the book is narrated by an adolescent, fifteenth to sixteen year old, but the sentences feel like they were written by an eight year old with serious learning difficulties. All of the sentences, the entire book. We’re not talking just bad grammar here, we’re talking downright imbecile writing. Teenagers don’t sound like this. Neither do younger kids. Nor do people with mental retardation. I remember reading one book written by a group of individuals with mental retardation and their sentences were nothing like these. Don’t try to pin it up to social anxiety or autism because there is no mention of it in the novel and besides have you read anything written by someone with autism? It doesn’t sound like this. Who talks and writes like this? Not even a teen who smokes pot from morning to evening, nobody sounds like this. I suffered reading every sentence. I kept thinking ‘If I see incidentally just one more, I’m going to kill myself’ but sure enough ‘Incidentally’ kept coming. Well, I didn’t kill myself but I was annoyed. And then annoyed some more. I noticed that the author kept some of the sentences exactly the same, repeating them in different situations, for instance Charlie says ‘he told me something I think I will never forget’ twice and you can feel how the other thinks what follows is some great wisdom. No, it’s not. I think the writer was trying to create a signature style but instead he just copied a bunch of sentences. Perhaps the writer wanted to show is that Charlie is learning to write so he added words like ‘incidentally’ to his idiotic sentences but it was just adding insult to injury. There are sentences like: ‘I never saw a film’ when what Charlie really means to say is: ‘I’ve never seen a foreign film.’ The writing is confusing on every level. It is not just the incredibly simplified vocabulary and idiotic sentences. Besides syntax, vocabulary, dialogues and sentence formation, the writing lacks - everything. The writing is horrible, just horrible. I don’t what this book sounds translated to other languages, maybe it is not as bad, but to read this novel in original language (English) is incredibly painful.I DIDN’T LIKE THE NARRATOR AT ALL (NOT JUST THE WAY HE NARRATED THE BOOK BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM)Second of all, let’s talk some more about our charming protagonist Charlie. When he sees a random girl get raped, what does he do? Nothing. I mean it is happening right in front of him and he doesn’t even say a word. What happens when a guy punches up his sister in the face? Nothing. When his homosexual friend Patrick gets into a fight with his old lover Brad and his friends, what does Charlie do? Well, fights back and defend him. Because it is ok to defend yourself and other guys, but not girls. Ladies don’t deserve to be defended, is it? I couldn’t help feeling like he feels that women deserves what happens to him. The way he casually speaks about women who are victims of domestic abuse was particularly annoying. It is like Charlie is saying, women will get punched by men, and it’s just the way it is. I mean if Charlie can fight somebody (and even a group) who attacks him or his gay friend, why can’t he defend his own sister, especially since he supposedly cares a great deal about? You don’t have to be very smart or mature to at least urge your sister (who is not much older than yourself) to get out of an abusive relationship. Does Charlie do that? No, Charlie just tells on her to his teacher and then when his sister gets back to the abusive boyfriend Charlie does nothing. If it was his precious gay friend, he would have done something, but not for his own blood. What to say about his relationship with his sister? Or Charlie’s relationship with his family? He says his parents are great a couple of times, but it’s all fishy. His mother is a shadowy character, and his dad is not much different but all the references to them feel empty. Charlie spends most of his time thinking about himself. There is also this girl Sam that he is in love with, but the way he acts about it is both selfish and mature. Charlie starts going out with another girl and the way he treats her is just mean, but what else can we expect? This gives us a wonderful opportunity (I’m being sarcastic in case you can’t tell) to read many chapters in which Charlie feels sorry for himself. Because it is just great reading about how Charlie cries and cries and feels sad and sad. My favourite sentence in the book is when Sam tells Charlie how he can be so stupid at times. If I could rewrite it into- Charlie you’re so stupid all the time, it would be perfect. Charlie is supposed to be this great guy because he says he wants to make even unconventionally pretty girls feel pretty, which is ridiculous because it just shows he is a hypocrite who believes that there is some kind of convention. All that PC stuff made me want to vomit. I NEITHER LIKED NOR UNDERSTOOD OTHER CHARACTERSThirdly, why does everyone treat Charlie like a child, even teenagers who are his own age? Is there something about his appearance that makes him seem like an eight year old? If there is, shouldn’t we as readers know about it? Why does everyone rustle his hair like he is five? Why does that teacher keep giving Charlie A’s when the way he expresses himself is at best appropriate for a person starting elementary school, not high school. Let’s take a quick look at other characters. Patrick is a poor excuse for a human being but Charlie seems to adore him. Maybe because having a protagonist with a gay friend will sell more copies? What’s wrong with Patrick? First of all, he sleeps with another boy who is clearly intoxicated. Am I the only one who sees that’s potentially problematic? Then after they break up, Patrick sleeps around and kisses Charlie every night but Charlie says nothing because he is a good friend. WTF! WTF! Moving on to his sister Sam, who is another object of Charlie’s adoration. She makes no sense as a character. There are also a lot of confusing things in the relationship of Charlie and other characters. How does Charlie know exactly how Patrick and Brad have sex and who put what where? Did he see it? Why do people keep doing everything (make out, argue, have sex) in front of him? Am I the only one who notices this makes no sense? One can understand why Charlie’s family might treat him with special care because they are aware he had some kind of a mental breakdown when he was a little, but the rest just doesn’t make sense. Even his family isn’t consistent in their treatment of him.CONDESCENDINGI hate the condescending way every teenager in this book is portrayed. Do you know anything about teenagers? You know that an average person is pretty much intellectually developed when they reach adolescence? Take a look at any school curriculum if you don’t believe me. Take a look at what is actually being taught in high school. Adolescents and teenagers aren’t adults, but neither are they idiotic morons. I don’t see any sense in treating teenagers as very small children. With that I mind, the characters of teachers in this novel felt odd. Weren’t people who works with teenagers supposed to know something about them? I guess not. As far as I remember when I was 15 and 16 people didn’t talk to me like I was 6. WHAT IS UP WITH THE CRYING?Every few minutes, Charlie breaks into tears. ‘ I was sad. I cried’, that’s the best the writer can up with to describe an emotional state. He does it not only with Charlie but with other character. Why bother with telling us anything about characters? Why bother with writing the characters’ inner or psychological state when all you can do is write they were sad and cried. Yeah, that should do it. Thrown in every psychological trauma that you can think of and there you go, you got yourself a best seller. Some might say it is unfair emotional blackmail of readers, but don’t let that stop you. I do for one feel that the author ( Stephen Chobsky) included every single psychological issue/trauma he could think of (just cramped it all in there) in hope of managing to emotionally blackmail readers into liking this book and while it worked out for him, I still think it's a cheap trick. At time it seems that just about everyone in this novel was sexually abused and molested. Every other character i san abuse victim, because that is easier than actually writing about them. Why bother with character development or descriptions when you can just write down they cried.I DIDN’T LIKE THE PLOTWhat is the plot anyway? There is this big revelation at the end of the novel, but the way it is handled is disturbing. Nobody is to blame for anything. Or wait they are. Or they aren’t. At any rate, the writer can’t decide. Who needs to write something that makes sense when you can emotionally manipulate readers into thinking your novel has some kind of an artistic value? FINAL WORDSThe only place that had some kind of message were the last two pages of the novel. Not a very inspiring message, it was a bit confusing to tell you the truth, but it was a message nevertheless. The rest was just retelling of events that didn’t capture my interest at all. There is this episode in which one teenage guy (Peter was it?) gets angry because another teenage guy cheats on his girlfriend and everyone acts like it’s the most dramatic thing that has ever happened. They all get worked out about it, including our righteous narrator. Because a teenage guy will totally freak out of another teenage guy cheating- that calls for an intervention. Not the rapes, abuses and so on. Cheating is this dramatic thing but all the same time, abuse is treated like it’s nothing. How is it a bigger deal when a guy cheats on his girlfriend than when someone child is abused or some girl is raped? How? This novel is not only poorly written but it makes absolutely no sense. The Perks of Being a Wallflower mentions a lot of great American novels, but it is far from being even a good novel. This one was so bad it hurt. This is what I imagine hell is like- being forced to read this kind of writing. To conclude, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the worst novels I have ever read, if not the worst. Show more"

I revisit Perks every couple years because it is a quick, easy, heartfelt, gut-wrenching read. Because Charlie's voice is so sweet and sincere. Because we've all been 15 but not all of us are as thoughtful as Charlie with the foresight to record our coming-of-age experiences, much less in a series of letters, much less these days. And because some days, when I'm drowning in the swamp of adulthood, I want to return to that moment at 15 where every song changes your outlook on life, where every moment shared with friends matters so goddamned much, where parties don't already feel like just another party but like the first night of the rest of your life, and where we could swear we felt infinite.Charlie is a 15-year-old high school freshman who is deeply considerate, contemplative, and emotionally sensitive. He has recently lost one of his only friends to suicide just before high school begins in the autumn of 1991. He spends his days reading, observing, deeply feeling and processing the world around him. At the beginning of this story, he is lonely and isolated, but then he meets Sam and Patrick at school, and they embrace him for all his eccentricities and show him real friendship and love. He connects with his English teacher who shows him how to think outside of the confines of assignments and connect with literature in a way that is necessary for Charlie. He writes to an anonymous recipient of his coming-of-age experiences, from his first kiss to his first drink to the discovery of some repressed childhood memories. We (the anonymous recipient) feel his love on every page of this beloved book.Chbosky perfectly captures the voice of a traumatized, loving adolescent in a way that makes this book palatable and relatable to those who read it even a generation after its initial publication. He captures that feeling of being in the stands at a high school football game, of carving out your spot in the society within the school, of the first time you truly love someone, and of the first time you realize the things that have been done to you that were never okay. Sure, people might look at this book now and say it is riddled with clichés, but we really have Tumblr circa 2011 to thank for that one. Plus, however cliché it might sound, ""we accept the love we think we deserve"" is a powerful sentiment. And we have this book to thank for it. Often this book is criticized for its handling of Charlie's potential spectrum disorder. To those critics I would like to remind you: context is everything. This book came out in the early 90s. The discussion surrounding spectrum disorders was nowhere near as prevalent as it is today. Beyond that, the main character of this book is deeply traumatized by things that happened to him as a young child. Trauma's impact on the brain can manifest in many of Charlie's behaviors in this novel, and it doesn't necessarily condemn him to any diagnoses that he went through those things. That criticism really bothers me and shows just how uninformed we are about the traumatized brain. I work with clients in this age group or not much older and Charlie is not unlike them in many ways. To criticize this book for that reason shows a level of ignorance that could potentially get in the way of this book falling into the hands of a kid that needs to know they are not alone.If you haven't read The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I highly suggest it. Even if you're an adult and it won't have the impact it might have had at 15 when I first read it (although, my boyfriend just read it for the first time at 24 and was deeply impacted), I think if you jump into this super quick read, you'll find yourself remembering how it felt to be that age. What the world meant to you then. How moved you were by the little things around you, or maybe even how much you never stopped to take stock of all those things. If we can take away one thing from our dear Charlie, it is that we should observe this world for its beauty and meaning as often as possible. It never hurts to be reminded of that.Love always,LilliShow more"

You keep quiet about them. And you understand.""(Chbosky 37)I am the very definition of a wallflower in all its glory and condemnation. In fact, by saying that I am also going to say that I'm a homosexual version of Charlie. I don't mean this to sound like a person that's hopping on The Perks of Being a Wallflower bandwagon because that's not my intention at all. In fact, I was skeptical on whether or not I would even enjoy this book because I'm not one for the majority, meaning I don't find myself liking the same things as many other people of my generation (e.g. most music, television shows, thought processes, general culture, etc.). However, when I say that I am Charlie, more or less, I mean that in the most sincere way possible.For starters, I should probably mention the many reasons why I came to the conclusion that Charlie and I are one of the same. Here I go.Charlie is an example of a pariah. Now when I say that he's a pariah I don't mean that he has no friends, family or personal connections whatsoever. I'm saying that he is a person of which no one understands: the way he acts, what he says and does not say, how he feels, etc. He has this ability to love the people that matter the most to him (as do I) and still feel that at some level it is not reciprocated when it really is and he even says that he notices it (as do I). This is problematic because it creates social anxiety and is harmful on mental stability. He becomes passive in some instances where he chooses to be silent instead of ""doing things,"" as mentioned by Sam at the end of the novel.Charlie also shares a passion for literature as do I, as we've read most of the same novels that have been mentioned in the story (although there are some I haven't read yet, but they are on my list of ""to-reads"").Charlie also has a tender and romantic side of him that allows him to see into a person's heart instead of getting stuck on appearances. I find this is be incredibly hard-hitting because most of the characters in the text get hung up on the physicality of a person, which I see most prominent in the society of today even if this narrative was written over a decade ago. That alone speaks volumes because the key to great literature is a story's ability to remain timeless and relatable even when it passes it's prime. All of the characters in this narrative are completely relatable and I've even seen them disguised as people I've met within my lifetime.I also notice how Charlie gives novels as gifts. I do the same. In fact, I believe we do this because when we read a book, we're reading more than just words on a page. We're reading life. A life in which we imagine, feel, and connect with, which makes narratives mean something that only booklovers can empathize with. So, what do I do when I read a novel that has changed me in some way? I pass it along. Well, I buy another copy of the book and then pass it along. In doing so, Charlie and I are passing more than just a book to someone that we care about, we're passing a part of ourselves so that the receiver will always have a part of us with them for as long as they have that novel.There are more reasons I can list that will show why I have a deep profound relationship with Charlie (e.g. us both hating our birthdays), but to do so will keep me writing for days, which I don't have time for because there are other books I want to read.I would like to end this review with the portion of the poem that is mentioned within the text, but to do so would mean I would ruin the entire poem experience to anyone that reads this review before the novel. So, I won't. Just know that the last stanza is completely relatable to me on a metaphorical/mental level, but not a physical one.Other than that, I think now is a proper time for me to watch the film for the first time after having kept the promise I made to myself that I would not see the film until I've read the book.Show more"

Actually, I'm lying - this review is probably going to be full of cheesy cliches. Am I the only person (still technically a teenager) in the world who does not ‘get’ this book? Please tell me I’m not the only person in the world who had a fun time in high school and was actually really happy with my parents and my friends? That brings me to my main problem with this book: I just don’t get it. I don’t really get teen angst in general to be honest and that is just because my experiences never correlated with that. However, in saying that I have to admit that the part which I did have tears in my eyes was during the graduation. This probably wasn’t the intended spot for people to start crying in, but nonetheless that is what I managed to do. It’s probably only because those feelings of graduating and moving out of home are still quite raw to me, but that is what resonated with me most at this time in my life. I guess that is what makes this is a classic for so many people, there is something that most people can relate to at one point or another in here.Overall, I felt that Charlie was a rather forgettable character. For me, his letters seem to channel the stories of the people around him, rather than his story. Wait...was that the point? Did I miss the point and then criticise it? Honestly this book confused the hell out of me at times. This was cruising along at two stars until page 68 which was the point at which I fell in love with Chbosky. I am awarding a whole extra star for this present alone. At this point Charlie presents Sam with a present. A present which I dream of receiving from my future soulmate. A present which just happens to be associated with my favourite Beatles song (and believe me this title is not bestowed lightly). If I had to pick just one Beatles song that would be it. Of all the songs Chbosky could have chosen, he happened to pick that song - clearly we would be perfect for each other. Alright, I’m kidding, but seriously when I do get engaged sometime in the distant future the first thing Mr Right will be reading is this book. Hopefully he’ll get the hint. I loved the Fleetwood Mac, Nick Drake and Beatles references - I’m not the biggest fan of The Smiths, so all those references were completely lost on me. I think, though, that the song which best sums up how I felt about this book is by Procol Harum. A Whiter Shade of Pale is kind of confusing, yet beautiful, but not one of my all time favourites...like this book. Funnily enough, it also rates a mention on Charlie’s famous mix tapes. I am also going to include some Cat Stevens because singing along to him on a drive makes me feel infinite*. Anyway, Charlie, I think you need some cheering up so I just need you to know The First Cut Is The Deepest. Please try to love again. So, to sum up, I am going to quote the novel:“The thing is, I didn’t know what it said even if it said it very well.”And, because cliches are fun:“We accept the love we think we deserve.”*Don’t say I didn’t warn you about the cheesy cliches.This review and many more can be found at Maree's Musings.Show more"

Except maybe he got to see the world in a different way, a deeper one.“I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.” “And all the books you've read have been read by other people. And all the songs you've loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that's pretty to you is pretty to other people. and that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing 'unity.” “And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it's enough. I really do because they've made me happy. And I'm only one person.” “I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.” “I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.” When you refer to someone as a ‘wallflower’, it is because that person tends to be shy, not sociable. Typically a loner.“He’s a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.”Being a wallflower, for Charlie, has made him keep quiet about lots of bad things he shouldn’t have kept quiet about. It made him repress bad old memories. It made him live inside his head amid his thoughts so he would not have to go through reality.“Sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.” He kept it locked inside till he eventually exploded.What I loved the most was the idea of friendship in the story; how friends have the ability to mend what is broken of you, how they can help you get better. But it is also risky; if you do or say something stupid, it would be rather hard to make things go back to what it used to be.“Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody.”I absolutely relate to this immensely.Recommended for wallflowers.Show more"

Blame my love for this book.I think my heart just found its way to the best Young Adult book I've ever read. Screw people that think YA has no good titles, if this isn't quality right here I don’t know what is.I’ll be forever in debt with Stephen Chbosky for creating a book that understands me better than I understand myself. Not even for a moment I believed that this was written by anyone else than a thoughtful, brilliant teenager. This is a story about loss, love and friendship, but even more than that, it’s brutally sincere. Nonetheless, Charlie’s thoughts were very tender. I do believe the world would be a better place if we could all be sensible and kind as he was. I envy the person who could read his letters, for he/she is lucky enough to have the trust of such a lovely character.Like I said, I’ll be keeping this short.

I was a preteen when I first read  The Perks of Being A Wallflower. At that time, I wasn't exposed to books that deal with tons of heavy, touchy subjects like molestation, suicide, substance abuse, domestic abuse, rape, mental health issues, abortion, etcetra -  The Perks of Being A Wallflower seemed to pummel me with one horrifying social issues to another. My poor, fluffy 12 year-old-self couldn't deal.All I can remember is feeling very sick and very overwhelmed during my reading process. I just couldn't click with Charlie or with the issues the book touch upon. I felt that they were handled too loosely.It was sickening to read about Charlie witnessing a rape scene but was immobile to report it. Heck, he barely even blinked twice. If I read between the lines, I suspected he may be autistic but knowing even that doesn't make me feel like excusing his monotonous narration of the horrible events. I found this book disturbing years ago and I simply did not understand the hype at all. I do plan on rereading this to see how it will affect me now that I'm already a teen and have my share of experiences. But for the moment, I'm marking this as simply not my cup of tea.Show more"

Have you heard about it? It's a coming of age tale of a boy named Charlie who has a lot of problems, then he meets other people who also have problems. And a story ensues.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a book about people with tons of baggage, essentially. It has a lot of great character development and really quotable lines. And it gives me high school nostalgia feelz.Let's start with the main character, Charlie. He comes off like a very sheltered and naive freshman; you can tell there is something very off about him from the beginning. He's wide-eyed and soft, but with an unexpected violent edge. The way Charlie describes everything is so saccharinely innocent that each time he discovers something, you just want to say:He meets Patrick - who I liked initially, because much like Honey Badger, Patrick appears to not care what people think about him. But as things start to unravel for Patrick, he becomes less fun and spontaneous and more of a cliché. Which saddened me as it made the character less likable.Then Charlie is introduced to Patrick's step-sister, Sam. He immediately moons over her despite her initially (but gently) trying to dissuade him of his crush on her. Charlie's sister tries to slut-shame Sam to him, but Charlie doesn't care - he's a self-destructive character who seems to only attract people to him who have the potential of breaking his heart.And then there is Mary Elizabeth, who is so full of herself that she literally can't even. She's a typical high school trope of a rebellious teen that secretly wishes for a house in Vermont and a white picket fence. She thinks much too highly of herself and is deeply insecure. Mary Elizabeth is Charlie's first girlfriend, but she treats him as an accessory and they break up because of prior existing drama.In a way, this book felt familiar - like I had experienced it before in some form but I just can't exactly put my finger on it. Each character is someone you knew in high school, perhaps they were even a close friend or a fierce enemy. Maybe you just categorized them according to what group they belonged to instead of getting to know them better; and you may have found a piece of them in yourself if you took a closer look. But you see them as you want to see them - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what you find out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, and a princess, and a criminal.Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.PS: You best not forget about me. KIT.Show more"

But I won't live for you'' Just because you love someone enough to die for them doesn't mean you should let them change who you are or dictate the way you live your life. The main protagonist Charlie could learn a lot from this and it nicely addresses his defining characteristic: his ability to blend into the background and become whoever a particular person needs at that specific time. A shoulder to cry on? He'll morph into one. Someone to fool around with to dull the pain of a break-up? He's your man. Want to date someone not because you have anything in common but because you can't find anyone better? Charlie won't mind. All this means that the main character doesn't have much personality of his own and never does anything solely for himself. He is not your typical literary protagonist who is 'in charge of their own destiny', has a cast of secondary characters revolving around their every move and does reckless and impulsive things for 'plot reasons'. But he is real and even if people cannot relate to him themselves, they'll know someone like him. After finishing Perks I can understand why views on this book are so polarised and, once you get past the admittedly awkward writing style, I think a lot of it just comes down to personal taste. Some people will be able to relate to Charlie, a socially awkward teen seen as an outsider at school, a lot better than others and I think they'll have more patience for this book than those with very different school experiences. Maybe this has blinded me to some of the flaws that annoyed so many other people, such as the fact that the narrative voice appears far too juvenile for a 16 year old getting straight As. However, I think that the writing style makes sense once you read the reveal at the end, which allows you to understand why Charlie is the way he is.It actually took me a while to get into this book, about 50 pages, which doesn't sound like much but when you consider that the book is only around 230 pages, it seems like a lot. But once I did get past that point, I was sucked into the story and almost finished it in one sitting. Quite a feat for someone with an attention span as limited as my own. The main subject matter of this book (teenage angst, suicide, sexual abuse, teenage pregnancy, etc.) has become a genre onto itself and an almost obligatory part of any coming-of-age story, and while other books have dealt with it better, many more have been much, much worse. A solid  four stars .Show more"

I want to say that I never gave up on Charlie. There were times where I was scared for his well being but I never and will never give up on Charlie. Having to survive through a new year of school can be hard especially when there are different situations around you that can lead you down different (dark) paths. Charlie in a way helped everyone around him or at least he tried his best to. In my opinion him being around older groups of people was both a good thing and a bad thing. I wish he had had his friend to get through his first year of high school with, I don’t know if it would have made a difference but it was always a thought I had while reading the book. Reading the chapter with his Aunt Helen had me close to tears in both my class and on the bus because it was so expected yet unexpected in a way. But later reading I found out what happened between him and his aunt in times when they were alone and that crushed my heart. What happened between Charlie and his Aunt Helen was unexpected to say the least but it made me understand in some aspect more about him and showed him and me who were gonna be there for him in his times of need. Because he deserved people around him who cared about him at the end of the day. This book will truly stay with me forever. I am so proud of Charlie for getting though his tough times and making it out in some way. If I could I would give him a big hug. My two favorite quotes from this book would have to be:“We accept the love we think we deserve.” This is so true in today’s age where we just accept the bare minimum because it's what we think we deserve. This could be because and “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”You will go through times in your life where you will feel like you’re walking on air and nothing can harm you and that’s amazing, especially after going through other times in your life where you feel like you are worth anything. If you are ever in the position where you have some free time I would definitely recommend picking up this “classic” young adult fiction about a boy who is just trying to get by day after day, minute by minute. In the end Charlie was another character that I have read about over the years that has taught me that I am not alone. And that I matter enough and will always matter to at least one person around me, even if that one person is only me. “Once and for all. Forever and always.You are not alone.”Show more"

Please, for the love of little baby Jesus, please be more like Charlie. 😄2/3/17Ok, friend. Facebook popular culture reference aside, I really wish more people would be like Charlie. Don't get me wrong, Charlie has his issues (and there are things in Charlie and Sam and other character's lives that I wouldn't wish on anyone), but at his core he has a wounded innocence and strength of love that is profound. Charlie doesn't care if your gay or straight or Democrat or Republican. Charlie can stick up for his gay friend and also read and enjoy the heart of the message of The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. (See what I did there liberals and conservatives 😉) These are qualities that are sorely lacking in our culture today. I have always tried to be this way. I try to Pay it Forward. I don't sleep around because, while I appreciate everyone's personal choice, I try to treat women like I would want the women in my life to be treated. I try to treat people of all colors and creeds and preferences the same. I'm not perfect at any of these things, but I just want to give way more than I take. And that is what I want to see more of in the world. This book is about so much more and tackles even deeper issues that are rampant in our society today, but to talk about that would be a spoiler, and you should experience it for yourself. I just connected with Charlie and these are things that have been on my mind lately. I hope you understand. Your friend, LeviShow more"

I really didn't. I was expecting a whining, dramatic fifteen-year-old Charlie. But all i encountered was openness and sweet, sweet honesty. Oh, Charlie. You owned me from page one. :)The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a lot of things. It dealt with drugs, sex, abuse, bullying. You might find that negatively intimidating but Chbosky's writing softened the blows that might have stung because of such delicate issues. The softening was a welcome embrace.Charlie had a run with (almost) everything teenager-y. Unrequited first love. LSD. Make out sessions. Smoking. Abortion. With all this, he still felt he was standing on the sidelines. But he was loved by his sister. he talked to his dead aunt in the graveyard when no one else wants to be his friend. he has his English teacher who kept on giving him books that seemed to be the little stories of his life.A tumultuous year it might've been, but Charlie made it. By being unconsciously strong, and unflinchingly accepting to things he cannot alter.Once I started, I could not put down The Perks of Being a Wallflower. It's charisma is undeniable. Numerous chuckles erupted from me every now and then. I want to shelter Charlie from the harsh realities of life, but Charlie reveled in it. He flourished. And while things in the past cannot change, Charlie chose to move on with his life. But this time, he will be living it, and not for others. =)I am in love with the mixed tapes! Asleep by the Smiths. Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. A song from Nirvana. Me and Charlie have similar taste in music!And Charlie likes to read! *high five* Mostly they are classics, and yes, i will read them soon. i already added them to my TBR list! such is the power of Charlie over me. Gosh, classics. Help me. Haha!Show more"

Cosa dire su quella che è appena diventata una delle mie letture preferite? Finalmente un bel libro sull'adolescenza e su come un ragazzo si sente in questo periodo della sua vita. Niente a che vedere con tutte quelle stronzate alla 'bianca come il latte, rossa come il sangue', dove viene trattato malissimo un argomento delicato e dove il protagonista si comporta solo come un adolescente si comporta esteriormente, ovvero omologandosi alla massa. Qui, invece, in questo romanzo epistolare molto triste e bellissimo, vengono toccati tanti argomenti, e sempre con la giusta dolcezza, senza mai sforare nel ridicolo o nel banale. A partire dalla prima sigaretta, dal primo bacio e dalla prima canna, fino ad arrivare al sesso, alle droghe più pesanti e alla scoperta di cosa c'è che non va in lui, Charlie affronta un percorso che dura un anno e che coincide con il suo primo anno di superiori. Il professore del corso avanzato di inglese che lo reputa più intelligente e che gli dà da leggere libri su cui scrivere dei saggi, l'amico di due anni più grande, gay, la cui persona che ama non vuole essere scoperta. E la ragazza di cui è innamorato, sorella del suo amico, anch'ella di due anni più grande. La sua prima ragazza, una persona con cui non riesce a sentirsi unito. La sorella che dice di odiarlo ma che poi lo abbraccia addirittura due volte in un giorno. Il fratello che è sempre via perché gioca in un'importante squadra di football e allo stesso tempo segue il college. Il padre che non alza mai le mani, la madre che è sempre tranquilla. La gioia di essere infiniti mentre si ascolta una canzone con i propri amici, la giogia di esserlo, un amico. La felicità nello scoprire che qualcuno ci vuole bene. Questo libro è un percorso di formazione, un'attenta analisi dei disagi del protagonista, provocati da un problema grave ma che è la chiave del romanzo, svelata solo alla fine. Consiglio a tutti di leggerlo, tutti ma proprio tutti, anche solo per rendersi conto di come si sente un ragazzo alla nostra età. Come si sente veramente. Attendo con impazienza il film diretto dall'autore stesso.Show more"

This doesn't sound like my freshman year of high school at all.The title of the book doesn't make sense because he's not really a ""wallflower"" since he just walks up to some guy and starts talking to him and he becomes his best friend. He isn't just sitting there being all awkward and watching the world go by.

This story of loss, innocence, first love, friendship, family, trauma, death and ultimately life, impressed me deeply.As you know, it is about this teenage boy named Charlie. A pretty common name, right? One might think his life is ordinary, but this couldn't be further from the truth, because you see, Charlie is special. He is extremely smart and observant, but above all, he is innocent. He loves books and movies, as do I, but unlike me, he is innocent, like a newborn.Charlie's observant nature enabled me to really see the characters around him, characters who assisted him in becoming who he is at the end. I could tell you what I think about his family (especially his aunt), about his friends and love interest, but I will just say this: Charlie is me, Charlie is you, Charlie is every man, woman and child in the world. Who hasn't struggled with finding their identity? Who isn't still struggling? Who really knows who they are? We are permanently losing and finding ourselves. We couldn't do this without the other people around us.I remember going through my own teenage crisis: existential questions, rebellious answers, idealistic views and foolish crushes on unattainable boys and men. It was beautiful. How I wish I could relive it.Jerry, never wish to grow up faster! Enjoy your youth! Youth is your most precious gift. The young can do anything. Never underestimate your power and never let anyone question your beliefs! Do not feel embarrassed if you feel love. Love is spiritual, love is pure. Love does not hurt you, it is the way people use love that hurts you.I realize that all the advice in the world isn't good enough for a teenager like you. You will only learn by doing, you will only feel by loving and living, not by listening to advice and definitely not by being a beautiful wallflower!Love always,Alex :PShow more"

Lo primero que me ha sorprendido gratamente ha sido el recurso narrativo utilizado, de forma epistolar, a través de la correspondencia que mantiene el personaje principal con un desconocido. Narrada en primera persona, facilita y agiliza su lectura creando una ilusión de comunicación inmediata. Además la historia obedece exclusivamente a la visión individual de Charlie, puesto que la correspondencia es unidireccional.Charlie, nuestro protagonista, es un personaje encantador, con el que resulta muy fácil empatizar. Tiene un punto de vista muy particular respecto a la vida, los amigos y las chicas, así como las preocupaciones propias de la pubertad. Es tímido, ingenuo, poco sociable y extremadamente sincero, lo que ocasiona se vea sumergido en algún que otro problema. Por otro lado nada que se salga de lo normal en la vida de cualquier adolescente, más concretamente en la adolescencia de la década de los 80, pero que cobra una mayor importancia debido a la personalidad de Charlie. Además el protagonista nos deleitara con su gusto por la música y la literatura, engrosando nuestras listas de lecturas pendientes y proporcionándonos también listas de reproducción con una banda sonora excepcional propia de la época.El resto de personajes que acompañan la trama también están muy bien construidos, y en su conjunto forman un grupo muy peculiar.

The fact that it is written in a series of letter, many will detest the book. But I tend to be the reader who loves to read thoughts of 15-year-old a weird, guileless boy called Charlie. Charlie, the titular ‘wallflower’!I am in a terrible shape lately, I haven't stepped out since IDK which month. The fact that this book has become my favourite because I thought I am the one who Charlie is relying on. He is sharing his world, his struggle and hopes that he has.

But how can you not adore Charlie after reading these letters?The writing is average as you get the notion that you are getting letters from a 15 years old. I also felt the change in the writing as the months go. Along the way, the writer intelligently explores YA themes such as mental health, substance abuse and sexuality, whilst simultaneously reminding the reader about how exciting it is to be young.I cannot recommend The Perks of Being A Wallflower highly enough. This book is so relatable. I have read many books but seldom I could put myself in those characters. When I first read The Perks of Being A Wallflower, I was Charlie.

This book follows Charlie, a freshman, just trying to get through his first year of high school. He makes friends with some seniors and they become really close over the school year. There really isn't a strict plot to this book, which I love so much. It just starts out with Charlie in his freshman year and ends with him going into sophomore year. There will be minor spoilers throughout the review. The characters were amazing. Charlie is an innocent child. It's sometimes funny how innocent he is with his little senior crush. The weed brownie scene proves my point entirely. Then we have Sam. She's so sweet to Charlie and she just wants Charlie to be the best Charlie he can be. (The weed brownie scene also proves my point.) She cares so much about her friends and she'll always put them first no matter what. Patrick. The comedic relief in this book. Charlie knew that he could always go to Patrick when something was wrong. Some of my favorite parts in this book involved Charlie and Patrick just talking. I wasn't really a fan of the way the story was told. I got used to it after a while, but it was hard to read sometimes because of the way it was written. The writing was amazing though. This author did not shy away from hard topics, which is something I really enjoyed. It was almost poetic in a way. Because of the way the story was told, it made the writing seem more unrealistic. There is no way I'm writing a letter like Charlie did. Overall, I really liked this book. It's realistic and short read.

Such books don’t really need the marketing or to be written about on blogs, nor do readers really go about scouring the internet for pointless nonsense on books already sitting and collecting dust in bookstores. Also, I don’t often read the same book from front to back over and over and over again. I’ve always believed that there is so many wonderful characters and worlds out there to discover that lingering more than necessary over one means to sacrifice all the others. That was all before I fell into Charlie’s backwards world in Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower.I was roaming around the shops during my vacation in Milan back in October when I came across an English bookshop tucked away in one of those tiny shops that are impossible ever to find again. Nothing really drew me to the book I just saw it sitting on a crowded table along with all our other American authors – Steinbeck, Sinclair, Twain, the list goes on and on.So here I am over a month later on my way to writing a review of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. No, it did not take me that long to finish the book. The thing is, I read and reread the book from start to finish three times since. This is no exaggeration. The book and its characters has really touched me heart during a time in my life that I feel myself slipping away and unfamiliar with the soul taking over. So Charlie, the narrator is a wallflower. This is an epistolary novel.Through a series of letters he recounts his observations of the world. His first year of high school is a long trail of tears, love and wrung out confusing feelings. Charlie is, quite bluntly, an emotion and disastrous wreck. The reader enters the scene following the suicide of one of Charlie’s only friends, Michael. All he really is in search for is someone kind. A kind individual who listens and doesn’t break others’ hearts, even when they could have.Introverted young Charlie still suffers after the death of his Aunt Hellen, blaming himself for her being gone. Everyday on his birthday, he replays the last day he saw her over and over in his mind, putting the fault on his own shoulders for not having prevented her from driving on that one snowy day.It’s in Charlie’s nature to watch life from the outside, rarely participating. All this begins to slowly change and take shape when Charlie begins spending time with Nothing, better known as Patrick and his pretty step sister with the green eyes that don’t make a big deal out of themselves, Sam. These siblings are both seniors, but welcome awkward, but gentle Charlie into their friendship circle. They introduce Charlie into a life of living: smoking, drinking, first dates, first loves, pulling him out of his little bubble of loneliness and instability.Charlie comes from an average family. His father is stern, but practical. His mother is the most beautiful woman Charlie has every laid eyes on and alway in accord with Charlie’s father. His sister is pretty and treats boys awful because she knows she’s pretty. Charlie’s brother gets into Penn State on a football scholarship and spends time talking, watching, doing – living for anything else. Charlie loves his family. There are several moments, such as when his brother ignores him or his sister pushes him away, that Charlie has to feel spite towards his family, but he just can’t help but love them even more. He is such an endearing character that I couldn’t help but fall for him with the turn of every page. Charlie does seem rather disturbed at times with his sporadic mental breakdowns but instead of thinking him as mentally challenged or even autistic, I choose to seem him as a teenager who just looks at the world differently, perhaps with a more innocent and delicate perspective.Charlie’s letters reflect his perceptions, participation and “non”-participation in the world and involvement with those around him. His feelings are deep and raw. Charlie’s mind plays tricks on him and its really his thoughts that mess him up . The less he seems to think and spend time with others, the better off he seems. His reactions to serious situations such as molestation and abuse are late and altogether wrong but I really think that’s what gives Charlie his charm and makes this book so powerful. He thinks, weighs matters in his head and, whatever the consequences may be, put’s the desires and wants of others before his own, even when that means losing some of his own happiness in the process.And then there’s the writing style that had be absolutely twisted up in knots, not knowing whether to laugh or cry more than half the time. There were moments where Charlie’s account of things were so bizarre and strangely phrased that I just couldn’t help but laugh. But then, there were also handfuls of letters that just left me broken-hearted and questioning what life really has to offer altogether. So many little things happen to Charlie, but reading his experiences through his personal perception shows how much the “little things” in life build, and also destroy one’s faith and confidence in the world. I just really liked how deep and raw Charlie’s emotions were. He is affected by anything and everything from being touched by a girl to reading his new favorite book.The Perks of Being a Wallflower touches upon the nitty gritty of growing up. This is a coming-of-age story. Though I’m twenty two years old and working in a high school myself, this book still touched me. It was all more than what being a teenager is like. It’s about heartbreaks, depression and abuse from both an outward and inward perspective. I felt at times that I was in the story and then others like I was watching Charlie’s life pass from a distance.Charlie’s narration and the way he told about his experiences and his friends was strong and so realistic that at times I became lost between his world and the world I myself was occupying. Charlie is native and knows it. Everything he writes is innocent, delicate and has a harmonic romance about it. At times it was hard to believe Charlie was writing as a fifteen-year-old because there’s some things he was just so lost about such as sexuality and even common teenage drugs like LSD. However, I can’t say that this was a negative because Charlie’s persona makes him a character in need of love and attention which is the whole reason behind his letters to the reader anyway.At a period in my life where very little seems to make sense and much of what I had once had faith in is beginning to fade away The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a twinkle of company in my solace. I can’t say that it has rescued me from my hopelessness and disillusionment with the world but it has shown me that there are people out there who have it a lot worse. However, no matter how hard anyone else’s life is, it doesn’t change one’s own. I continue to battle my own mental illness, but I am now more aware that I am not alone – there is always a spirit out there, be it in a book or real life, who struggles similar if not worse heartbreak. Feeling nostalgic for an earlier time in my life, or perhaps one that never existed anywhere but in my imagination, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a book that I will forever hold close to my heart and look to for strength to persevere through the tears that have blinded me for so long from one home, city, country time to another.Show more"

I have always loved this book and I will always love this novel. There is just something about Charlie's letters that captures my heart. From his journey through friendship to love to family discord to mental health and his struggles, this novel is a pure sucker-punch in the reality of what goes in a typical teen's mind. This book is acclaimed for a reason and it holds a special place in my heart.The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky1000000 5 starsCharlie is starting high school and he’s nervous. He’s never exactly fit in. He’s not a nerd, but he isn’t popular. Charlie is just there. Charlie is a wallflower who is living a life and trying to run from it. As Charlie navigates through high school he writes letters to an unknown person about his life. He meets and befriends Patrick and Sam at a football. They introduce Charlie to the world of first dates, mix tapes, family drama, friends, sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.You know when you buy a book and think to yourself ”Wow this is gonna be great!” You’re worried it might be that amazing or it could fail miserably and disappoint you or just be that average book in the mass of the others. I had that feeling before starting this book. It’s been forever since I read a book like The Perks. I was obsessed with books like this when I was in sixth grade, but stopped reading them. When I was on that obsession kick I had come across The Perks of Being a Wallflower several thousand times and thought about reading it, but never picked it up. What really prompted me to want to read the book was the movie and then I started seeing great reviews for this book and I was sold and knew I just had to have it. I got it and I don’t regret paying $12 at Books a Million for a book with a little over 200 pages. This book was worth it. So worth it. This book won’t be for everyone. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is different and I loved every single minute of it. I loved the quotes and Charlie, Sam, and Patrick made me laugh a lot.Whimsical Writing Scale: 5The main male character is Charlie. Charlie is a wallflower and can I just say that he is absolutely adorakable! I mean this kid knows absolutely nothing and is so socially awkward, but he manages to be a believable character. I loved reading Charlie’s letters to his unknown pen pal. I connected with Charlie because I am somewhat of a wallflower. Charlie is easy to relate to in ways that are real. I’m not able to relate to Charlie’s emotional and physical trauma, but I was able to other things in his life. Charlie is one of those rare characters that has a story that made me think about it for days actually weeks. I’m still in shock over it even though I knew it was going to happen. The signs were there but the ending was unexpected.Swoon Worthy Scale: 4.5The Villain- Let’s just skip right past this one before I start to rage and scream about the unfairness of this situation and anyone who has experienced this from an adult. Villain Scale: 4.25The people that Charlie meets along the way to finding himself are what really made this book for me. We have Patrick, the goofball who always put a smile on my face. He’s the kind of friend that’s always there for you and I love Patrick. I also like that he had a story in Charlie’s story, too. Patrick has a presence and he makes it enjoyable even when I cried for him. Then there’s Patrick’s stepsister, Sam. Charlie is hopelessly in love with Sam and I actually really liked her character. Charlie and Sam have a very fun relationship, but it also has its ups and downs. I’m still not sure what happens between Sam and Charlie in the future because the possibilities are broad and endless. I kind of want to keep it that way. There’s Mary Elizabeth, Charlie’s first girlfriend. This is where Charlie starts to show that he is a guy and I liked that he was honest even though it hurt people along the way because Mary Elizabeth wouldn’t have moved on and would still be with Charlie and Charlie would be miserable. There’s Craig, who I never liked and still don’t. He eventually becomes Sam’s boyfriend and is present for quite a bit of the novel. There’s Candace, Charlie’s sister. I liked her presence in the novel even though it wasn’t great. She had just as much as a story in Charlie’s letters as everyone else. There’s Bob, Sam and Patrick’s stoner friend. I actually thought he was funny and I liked him. Then there was Bill, Charlie’s English teacher and a big role in Charlie’s coping. Bill gives Charlie many books and I think that in a way those books got Charlie through a lot. One of my favorite things about the characters in this book is that they are all insightful and say at least one thing that make you stop and think.Character Scale: 5This book isn’t for everybody. Some people won’t like the style, maybe they won’t connect, or they went in with too high of expectations. I went into the Perks with expectations but with absolutely no idea of how I wanted the book to be. I was surprised because, yes my expectations were high, but I also didn’t have a certain area of where I wanted The Perks of Being a Wallflower to be. For me this book was perfect and I just embrace it and I’ll probably re-read it one day.Now the movie is absolutely amazing. If you watch the movie before you read the book chances are you’ll be disappointed because there’s a lot missing and a lot added. I absolutely love the movie and in my opinion it’s better than the book because there is more Patrick. I also received a clear understanding of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The movie is great in its own way and so is the book. I just can’t compare them because I love them both equally but for different things.Plotastic Scale: 5Cover Thoughts: Call me crazy but I like the cover. I don’t love it, but I think it fits and that’s why I like it.Show more"

En un primer momento, creo que se puede llegar a hacer un poco denso y que es sobre todo hacia el final cuando la historia te engancha más y cuando realmente la disfrutas. También tengo opiniones encontradas sobre si ha sido o no un acierto por parte del autor utilizar el género epistolar como medio de transmitirnos la historia. Durante la lectura del libro me ha parecido que una estructura más novelada habría sido un acierto teniendo en cuanta la temática y la forma y el orden en que se desarrollan los acontecimientos. No obstante, y también segun la iba terminando, he dejado de ir viendo este hecho como un defecto importante. La historia nos viene a mostrar, por un lado, el cambio de etapa al que se van a someter la hermana y los amigos de Charlie porque en poco pasarán a la universidad, y cómo un chico más joven de carácter solitario asiste a lo que próximamente puede convertirse en un escenario de soledad debido a la marcha de estos primeros a sus nuevas universidades. De alguna manera en la historia quedan reflejadas todas las mayores inquietudes de una persona en esta etapa (amigos, parejas, problemas en la escuela, sexo, alcohol, drogas...), de una manera muy cómoda de leer y con unos personajes con los que se empatiza fácilmente. Sobre todo me han gustado los personajes de Charlie y Sam.El nivel de inglés del libro es adecuado para personas con un nivel intermedio de conocimiento del idioma, lo que en la Unión Europea equivaldría a un perfil B1. Desde el punto de vista lingüístico, resulta muy útil en tanto que recoge las estructuras, tiempos gramaticales, vocabulario, frases hechas, etc., que un estudiante de inglés suele ver en este tipo de niveles. De manera que, si bien lo recomiendo para el público en general, lo considero ciertamente apropiado para estudiantes.Algunas frases que han llamado mi atención:-""Our relationship was too one-sided. She wanted a person who was more open to discussion and didn't need someone's permission to talk"".-""Every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people"".-""The time we were walking. (...) I don't remember where we were walking to or where we were walking from. I don't even remember the season. I just remember walking between them and feeling for the first time that I belonged somewhere"".-""I was just trying to be a friend (...) But you weren't Charlie. At those times, you weren't being his friend at all. Because you weren't honest with him"".-""I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am (...) and if they do something I don't like, I'll tell them"".-""I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there"".NOTA: 7.5/10Show more"

I love this book like I would do a child. I would say that it’s hard to describe this sort of affection towards a book, but let’s face it, we’re on Goodreads, and if YOU people don’t get it then you shouldn’t be on here. Charlie. Dear, sweet, loving Charlie. The book is told through a series of letters that he is writing to someone he has never actually met. Charlie tells this anonymous person everything about what is going on his life. It starts with him talking about his friend who has recently committed suicide and then goes on to his new friendship with Patrick and Sam.Patrick is the best. There is nothing I can put into words that sums it butter than that. Read the damn book and find out for yourself.Charlie is in love with Sam. She is cool and sophisticated and beautiful, but not in the traditional way, or so Charlie says. She’s kind and funny and accepting. Charlie is learning to participate in life instead of standing on the outskirts and being a wallflower. Not just participating in life but experiencing it. He goes out, he drinks, he tries drugs, he gets a girlfriend, he learns the difference between being what someone needs vs what someone  wants. And most importantly he learns what it means to be your own damn person. As the story progresses we see the writing in these letters develop. Charlie is perfecting his craft and his dream of being a writer seems more and more plausible. He loves books. The most recent book he read is his new favorite book ever time. But Charlie is… different. There has been a lot of speculation as to whether he has a form of autism or not. I think the ending of this book explains Charlie's ""odd"" behavior enough that I haven't ever given it much thought. He’s socially awkward-overly honest without realizing the truth can sometimes be hurtful. He sees everything without fully understanding what he is seeing and there is a level of nativity that can’t be ignored. Charlie is special though, about that there is almost no argument. The struggle of finding oneself in those painful teenage years can certainly be a brutal experience. It can also be rewarding in ways we didn’t think possible. I find myself reminiscing about some of my own experiences, sometimes with fondness, sometimes with tears. Regardless of how we feel about those experiences, they do in fact make us who we are in the here and now. And that is what this book is about: life.A truly wonderful coming of age story that will have you smiling, gasping, laughing, crying and gritting your teeth in anger. If there is one book out there that could possibly help someone who feels lost, I think this is the one that I would recommend. I am so glad I took the time to re-read this one. Show more"

5 ★ - reread 08/26/22 and I still love Charlie ♥︎Meaningful. Beautiful. Poignant.
""And I think everyone is special in their own way. I really do.""
First of all, I connected with this book on a whole other level.
""Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve.""
This little gem is one of the most wonderful rollercoaster I've had the chance to get on.I related a lot with not only Charlie but the story as a whole.The main characters were real and raw and flawed in the most beautiful ways. From the beginning until the end I wanted to hug Charlie and tell him that we were all in this together.We all, at some point in our lives, have felt some of the things he felt.We all have been through different things that made us wonder and questioned how to do life, how to blend in, how to find our place or how to move forward.
""So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there.""
In the end it's not what happens to us that define who we are or even matter. It's how we respond and react to it.
""I think the idea is that every person has to live for for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people.""
Second of all, I live for this cover.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is as surprising as expected and as hopeful as heartwarming.
""And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.""

Acaba de empezar el instituto pero no tiene amigos, su profesor de literatura es su único amigo. Hasta que conoce a Sam y Patrick que son unos años mayor que Charlie pero con los que se lleva muy bien. Comienza un mundo nuevo para Charlie donde se siente más adulto y también empieza a fumar, a coquetear con las drogas, salir de fiesta, conocer música nueva y a conocer el amor.La historia está contada por cartas escritas por Charlie para un amigo y le va contando todo lo que le pasa en su día a día y todo lo que piensa. Es como un diario y hace la lectura más amena, al menos para mí. Y trata un poco de todo pero centrándose en temas adolescentes, la verdad que Charlie para tener 15 años, peca mucho de inocente.Me ha gustado la historia, pero no tanto como esperaba. Había oído hablar tan bien de este libro que me esperaba algo más. Esto no quiere decir que me ha decepcionado, pero que tampoco me ha parecido para tanto.Es una historia bastante realista con los temas que toca, aunque tenía la sensación de que algo le pasaba a Charlie o que no era ""normal"", a veces me recordaba un poco a August (La lección de August) por esa inocencia que muestra, además me ha ser como una piedra en algunos asuntos, no entendía yo esa actitud, pero esa sensación de ""adolescente piedra"" se aclara en final, que tiene un giro que no me esperaba para nada y me dejo un poco helada, todavía estoy procesando el final.

Told entirely in epistolary style, Charlie is writing to a friend whom he’s never met, and sharing the story of his freshman year in high school. The book touches on a lot of issues for young adults, and I do think that Chbosky tried to address a few too many issues, and a couple of them would have been better left alone, so he could focus more on the primary focus - mental health. For instance, the plotlines with his sister were so briefly touched upon that it really shouldn’t have been there at all. The domestic violence and the pregnancy scare were barely addressed, when in reality those are issues worth exploring more in depth I had never seen the movie, though I had some preconceived notions about what this book would be about. I thought it would be a little like the film 500 Days of Summer, which is a quirky romance story. I was pleased to see that it was nothing like that, and while there’s a slight romance subplot, it’s more there because what 14 year old boy doesn’t have a crush, and not because it’s the focus of the story.The way that mental health themes were depicted in the story was quite effective, and I ended up truly enjoying the story.

This book is so special to me. It tackles such important issues that aren’t often addressed in appropriate ways in fictional works.It’s not very often that books get the portrayal of mental illness right so it was so important to me that this book did. Charlie quickly became a character that felt very special to me. I know what it’s like to struggle and to feel the guilt of feeling like I’m a burden or too much for my family because they get worried for me so to see that in a character and it be shown in a way that felt like I was practically watching myself made me feel very seen.I could write my own novel on why this book is so special. “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”Show more"

Θετικές σκέψεις
Κάποια σημεία ήταν ωραία από την άποψη ότι διάβαζα για εμπειρίες και άγχη που έχω ζήσει η ίδια στο σχολείο και ειδικά στο γυμνάσιο (γιατί στο λύκειο ήμουν φλώρος και συχνά έμενα μέσα για να διαβάσω βιβλία). Τα πάρτη, οι πρώτοι έρωτες και κολλήματα, οι φίλοι, οι τσακωμοί και το αίσθημα που έχεις όταν δεν ξέρεις πώς να δράσεις σε μια κατάσταση μου ήταν γνώριμα και με έπιασε νοσταλγία.
Αρνητικές σκέψεις
Έχω ακούσει ότι υποτίθεται ο πρωταγωνιστής ΙΣΩΣ έχει αυτισμό το οποίο ο ίδιος ο συγγραφέας επίτηδες δεν ξεκαθαρίζει. Αυτό για μένα είναι λάθος γιατί αν πρόκειται για τέτοια περίπτωση τότε πρέπει να κοιτάξω την ιστορία με διαφορετική οπτική. Από τη στιγμή που δεν λέει κάτι, εγώ θα θεωρήσω ότι είναι ένας απλός 15χρονος που έχει τραύμα.Καταρχάς είναι φοβερά εκνευριστικός χαρακτήρας. (Οι υπόλοιποι είναι αδιάφοροι και δεν θα ασχοληθώ καν.) Κλαίει με το παραμικρό και παρότι χαρακτηρίζεται από όλους ως πολύ έξυπνο αγόρι, εγώ συνέχιζα να διαβάζω για τις εμπειρίες ενός παιδιάστικού πανίβλακα. Εάν υπήρχε μια δυνατή πλοκή που θα μπορούσα να ακολουθήσω με ενδιαφέρον ίσως να είχα ευχαριστηθεί περισσότερο την ιστορία, αλλά και πάλι δεν θα άξιζε 4-5/5 μόνο και μόνο λόγω του κύριου χαρακτήρα. Ειλικρινά ήταν βαρετό βιβλίο και στη μέση άρχισα να προσπερνάω φλύαρες παραγράφους όπου μπορούσα.Κάτι που με τρέλανε είναι το ότι ο συγγραφέας έχει επεκταθεί σε αυτήν την μικρή ιστορία από θέματα πρώτου οργασμού, σεξ και ομοφυλοφιλίας μέχρι οικογενειακή βία, αυτοκτονία, παιδικό βιασμό και ναρκωτικά. Το βρήκα πολύ ανησυχητικό το γεγονός ότι ο συγγραφέας δεν ασχολήθηκε με τίποτα από όλα αυτά σε βάθος. Όχι δεν λέω να αρχίσει να φιλοσοφεί στην ιστορία ή να κουνάει το δάχτυλο στους αναγνώστες επιδεικτικά. Όμως τέτοια θέματα πρέπει να λαμβάνονται σοβαρά. Αρχικά πως περιμένεις να λυπηθώ και να έρθω κοντά με τους χαρακτήρες που τα βιώνουν όταν κυριολεκτικά δεν ασχολείσαι εσύ ο ίδιος; Τι τα έβαλες; Για να σοκάρεις; Κάποιος χαρακτήρας πρέπει να δώσει βάση σε αυτά τα θέματα. Ακόμα και στην πραγματική ζωή δεν γίνεται όλοι να είναι τόσο απαθείς. Αν μου έλεγε μια φίλη μου ότι την βίασαν όταν ήταν παιδί δεν θα έμενα κουλ και χαχαχα-χουχουχου. Επίσης όταν κάποιος έχει κατάθλιψη και τάσεις αυτοκτονίας ΚΑΙ ΤΟ ΞΕΡΕΙΣ, δεν του δίνεις ναρκωτικά το κέρατό μου. Ίσως ένας αναίσθητος το κάνει αλλά έστω και ένας άνθρωπος από όοοοολους που είναι παρόντες θα μπει στη μέση και θα το σταματήσει ρε φίλε. 
Τελικές σκέψεις
Ήθελα να αγαπήσω το βιβλίο πραγματικά. Περίμενα να διαβάσω μια τρυφερή αλλά με βάθος ιστορία για ένα έφηβο αγόρι που εξερευνεί τη εφηβική ζωή αντιμετωπίζοντας ένα σοβαρό προσωπικό θέμα. Δεν λέω ότι όλα αυτά που υπήρχαν στην ιστορία δεν έπρεπε να υπάρχουν. Ίσα ίσα γνωρίζω ότι αυτή είναι η πραγματικότητα πολλών. Ωστόσο δεν θα κάτσω να διαβάσω να μου προσπερνάς σοβαρά γεγονότα με αέρα ‘δεν έγινε και τίποτα’Το προτείνω;Όχι. Έχω χρόνια να δω την ταινία αλλά θυμάμαι ότι δεν είχε πολλά από αυτά τα θέματα ίσως λόγω των ηθοποιών που μπορούν να μεταφέρουν τα αισθήματα των χαρακτήρων στην οθόνη και ο πρωταγωνιστής δεν μιλάει σαν 8χρονο, οπότε προτείνω να τη δείτε. Το βιβλίο δεν αξίζει κατά την γνώμη μου. Το έχω ήδη σβήσει από το κινητό.Show more"

However, it would kind of make sense to read for children who go through similar experiences and want to feel seen, acknowledged and heard, especially, since there is a happy ending despite the severe sufferings. Nevertheless, I feel like it's also kinda dangerous to let a teenager read it because the mind of a child are naturally not as ""robust"" to traumatic events because they're still fragile and in development (most of the time), so the book could potentially trigger some unexpected negative developments in the psyche of a still-growing person...Then, at the same time, claiming that this book is only for adults also felt kinda weird, especially given the young age of the narrator and the simplistic writing style (mimicking the one of a 15-year old) also kinda doesn't fit for adults who are, for example, used to more eloquent writing.After all those thoughts, I kind of came to the conclusion that this book is perfect for people interested and ready to read about heavier material in the spheres of psychology and education (adults and teenagers), which, of course, should not only be limited to psychologists or scholars/teachers, buttt just for the generally interested public!! Additionally, it's also a really helpful book for parents to maybe find out some parenting strategies that they aspire (and definitely don't aspire) to follow, since it gives insights into how a child might feel while not being able to properly communicate it to the parents.Overall, I feel like the story gives us a perfect example of pretty much everything that could go wrong in a teenager's life, so it can be of great use to analyse behavioural aspects and learn how to try to help or navigate around people that most definitely have a ""specific"" kind of character, abilities and personality.I really hope my review makes sense and it's understandable what I tried to write down, because, frankly speaking, articulating my thoughts currently feels like digging around in scrambled eggs and trying to find grains of salt.P.S. I'm rating this 3 stars because I am just too conflicted regarding how this book made me feel.At times, it was a 4 star and during other moments it bored me lots, so it was a 2 star... Therefore, the golden middle it is then!!!Show more"

So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.
Thank you, Charlie.Love always;Mahsa3/May/2017ریویو دور اول:It's just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can't do anything except ""be there."" I want to make him stop hurting, but I can't.از دیشب که کتاب رو تموم کردم این دومین بارِ که شروع میکنم به ریویو نوشتن؛ نمیدونم چرا انقدر سخته از چارلی گفتن؟کتاب رو نتونستم زمین بزارم تا تموم بشه. انقدر که چارلی همه چیز رو؛ احساسات و افکارش رو صادقانه و قشنگ نوشته بود.این اولین کتابیه که با اینکه فیلمش رو دیده بودم، برام هیچ تاثیری روی خوندنش نداشت. نامه‌ های چارلی همه و همه برام تازگی داشتن و اصلا برام مهم نبود که من از آخر این قصه خبر دارم. چون موضوع اصلا پایان نیست، این چارلی و نامه‌ های قشنگ و احساسات متفاوتشه که کتاب رو خاص کرده.موقع خوندن داستان چارلی احساس می کردم تمام کلمات، درست همونجایی هستن که باید باشن؛ یه جور کمال رو حس می‌کردم و من انگار تک تکِ کلمات رو درک میکردم و جلو میرفتم.You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things.این یکی از اصلی‌ترین ویژگی‌های شخصیت چارلیه، و اون ویژگی اینه که چارلی احساسات و زندگی دیگران رو بالاتر از احساس خودش قرار میده. میدونم، احتمالا خیلی‌ها تو دلشون میگن: «تکراریه! از الان مشخصه کتاب اسپویله! داستان مزخرف همیشگی!» ولی باید بگم احساس‌تون کاملا غلطه... و این کتاب و چارلیِ این داستان، کیلومترها از تصور شما فاصله داره. چارلی نمینویسه تا کسی براش دلسوزی کنه، نمینویسه تا خودش رو اثبات کنه. اون فقط خودشه! و همینه که این شخصیت رو انقدر عزیز میکنه. چارلی اغراق نمی‌کنه و خواننده به هیچ وجه حس نمیکنه باید دردهای یه نوجوون رو بخونه و این یه اجبارِ برای تموم کردنِ کتاب. بلکه به قشنگی خودش و احساسش رو بیان میکنه که خیلی زود باهاش صمیمی میشید، خودتون رو مخاطب نامه‌هاش می‌بینید و شاید بارها خودتون رو جای چارلی بگذارید.And i was happy because they were happy.چارلی برای همه خوشحالی میخواد، و وقتی میگم برای همه... منظورم همه س. میدونم این جمله تکراریه؛ اما تو این کتاب اصلا تکراری به نظر نمیاد. چارلی بهترین معیار از این جمله ست و اون بدون شک با خوشحالی دیگران خوشحاله، و این خوشحالی به طرز خاصی شیرین و دلچسبه. شاید چندین بار این جمله و احساس رو ازش بشنوید، اما براتون عجیب نیس. چون خوشحالی چارلی رو عمیقا باور دارید و از خوندن‌ش خوشحال میشید و ته دل‌تون آروم میگیرید به این خاطر که چارلی لیاقت این خوشی رو داره.""You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.""اون فقط نمی‌بینه؛ بلکه توجه می‌کنه... اهمیت میده. چارلی تعداد دفعاتی که توسط عزیزترین‌هاش بغل میشه رو میشمره و به خاطر می‌سپره و با تمام وجود ثانیه های شادی بی اندازه ش رو نفس میکشه تا فراموش نشن. چارلی میخواد اون اندک لحظات خوب‌ش رو برای همیشه داشته باشه، چون میدونه زندگی چیه، میدونه ممکنه تکرار نشن. و این به خاطر سپردن‌ها یه دلیل دیگه هم داره؛ چارلی میخواد تو لحظات سخت زندگی‌ش، با به یاد آوردن این لحظات شیرین حواس غم رو پرت کنه و به خودش یادآوری کنه که باز هم روزهای خوبی خواهند بود. خیلی از ماها این کار رو انجام میدیم... خودم رو میگم؛ وقتی احساس کنم کم مونده گریه کنم، توی ذهنم میگردم دنبال یه خاطره ی خوب، حواس خودم رو پرت میکنم تا یادم بیاد این احساس همه چیز نیست و خیلی اوقات هم جواب میده، فقط حیف که همیشه خاطره خوب دم دست نیست... و چارلی هم نگران همین بود و کوچیکترین‌ها رو هم به خاطر می‌سپرد‌. اون مدام از حال بدش نمیگه تا براش دلسوزی کنین، بلکه همه ی تلاش‌ش رو برای خوب بودن، شاد بودن و خیلی فکر نکردن انجام میده و این تلاش گاهی انقدر تلخه که گفتنی نیست.It's strange how things can change back as suddenly as they changed originally. When one thing happens and suddenly, things are back to normal.با ذهن شلوغ چارلی و با نگاه ریز اون روی همه چیز، از این حرف‌ها زیاد خواهید خوند. و خوندن اینها واقعا لذت بخشه و در عین حال بی اندازه درد داره. نمی‌تونم بگم با چارلی ساعت‌هایی پر از خوشی خواهید داشت، نه. با چارلی اشک خواهید ریخت، و شما هم با دیدن تلاش بی اندازه‌ش برای شاد بودن در کنارش مبارزه خواهید کرد...میدونم باید این ریویو رو هم مثل قبلی پاک کنم، اما واقعا میخوام این کتاب ریویو داشته باشه و بهتر از این هم کارِ من نیست. از چارلی خیلی باید گفت، از عشقی که به عزیزترین‌هاش داره، از تلاش‌ش برای دیدن شادی اونها و ندیده گرفتن خودش و تفاوت ساده و زیباش...چارلی به دوست داشتنی‌ترین شخصیت برای من تبدیل شد، چون فانتزی نیست؛ چون باورِ وجود داشتنش آسونه و میتونم بودن‌ش رو باور کنم، چون شبیه هیچکس نیست و فقط خودشه... اون به زیبایی می‌بینه، توجه می‌کنه، و اهمیت میده...4/January/2016Show more"

I’m not certain why I love it as much as I do, nor what it actually is about it that I enjoy. On the outside it is a coming of age story following the teenage years of Charlie. It’s told in a letter format, a sort of one sided pen pal situation in which Charlie writes to someone who he knows but hasn’t met. But on the inside, it captures those feelings of growing up and learning who you are perfectly. It has its profound moments and it’s sad moments, just like real life. I enjoy the narrative style as in his letters, Charlie rambles on seemingly unfiltered. He doesn’t think too much about what he writes, he lets it flow from his head straight down onto the page. It leaves the reader with a somewhat raw and unapologetic look into Charlie’s head. I also like that as there is only the letters from Charlie, and he addresses them “dear friend” so the reader can assume the character of ‘friend’ and root for Charlie. I see in many peoples reviews that they complain about how often Charlie cries and how sensitive he is. He is a very vulnerable young man, and if you’ve read to the very end, his sensitivity and the reasons behind it become clear. I’m not sure why people complain about how much he cries. Personally I understand the emotionally unstable part of recovery. Also, there is absolutely nothing wrong with crying. There is so much to relate to in this book. It’s very short, just over 200 pages. But it packs a punch when it comes to relatability. We were all a little like Charlie once. The awkwardness and innocence of growing up and figuring life out happens to us all. The first kiss, date, having sex, trying alcohol and drugs, that first heartbreak. The moment that you realise school is over and everyone has to get on with life now. The feeling that you’ll always be young and infinite, slowly disappears and you are left wondering when you grew up. How did life go so slowly and yet so unbelievably quick? This is the sort of book that for me, has a lot of substance. Some people I am sure will read this and just take it for what it is. A coming of age story. Which is fine, you do you. But by simply taking a moment to recognise the parts of this book that resonate with your own life, and I’m sure it will satisfy you more. I really enjoyed rereading this. I actually enjoyed it more this time around. I’d also like to recommend the movie version of this book. It’s was directed by the author and he also wrote the screenplay, so it’s a fantastic adaptation with a great cast. “So , this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I’m still trying to figure out how that could be. “Show more"

I'm fairly surprised that it's mine. This isn't the kind of book I usually enjoy but this one just clicked for me. There was melodrama, sure, but the story itself and the characters felt real. I cared about them and I felt what they felt every step of the way. This book was an emotional rollercoaster. I laughed. I cried. It's a bittersweet story with some absolutely beautiful quotes. I absolutely adore Charlie. He's just such a wonderful character. Sam is great. She could've very easily become a MPDG or a Mary Sue but she never steps over the line into the territory of either trope. She's real, she has a personality, and she has flaws. Patrick is lovely. He's funny and when he gets sad, I felt it hit me like it hit Charlie. This happy guy has been brought down and it's tough to see him that way. Mary Elizabeth I just felt so sorry for. In that moment I felt second hand humiliation for her. I felt her hurt and it felt like a punch in the gut. Charlie's close family were all wonderful. His parents and his siblings felt like a real family, although they sometimes had their differences or their arguments they all still clearly loved each other and his siblings always looked out for him. I loved the way the plot revealed things like the friends' note and what happened with Aunt Helen. Although both those parts made me cry, I felt like they were done perfectly and with the right amount of care.I never like writing reviews for books I love. I always find it hard to explain why I love them and I find that my reviews for them aren't always very coherent and just end up being me gushing about them. I know I've definitely gushed over this book in this review and I don't even care. I absolutely loved this book and everything about it. I highly recommend it.Show more"

It washes over you and fills in the gaps that need filling. You need to hug Charlie. Maybe you need to hug yourself too.A couple years ago at BookCon I was in line for a signing, and I happened to be in the line next to the one for Stephen Chbosky. His child FaceTimed him at that moment and he answered and said, ""Honey, daddy's at work right now. Do you wanna see all the people who came to see me?"" We all waved, and I didn't know it yet, but I think that's a moment when I really participated. I miss the little moments like those. Feeling lonely is so rough. There's no easy fix. This book comes close, though. There will always be a Charlie out there. You won't always need him, but when you do he will always be there. Sometimes you'll be in the tunnel, sometimes you'll have your back to the wall at the party. But Charlie will always be there with you. Even if no one else is.--Original review 2018:This book honestly might tie with I Am the Messenger by Markus Zusak as the heaviest book I've ever read. It also really reminded me of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, which is a great thing of course because that is one of my favorite books.I don't have too much to say because I think this is just one of those books that you have to experience.

Since I had a couple of friends who loved it, my expectations were high. Honestly, I was disappointed. I found it depressing, immature, and somewhat defiling. Even without all that, there weren't many redeeming qualities about it; I didn't laugh or cry, or even empathize with the character(s), and the ending left me hanging. Sure, there were a few good principles presented, but they were overshadowed by the overall message -- a common lie that's being fed to our generation, which says that there is no right or wrong - that it only matters what you feel.And yet, despite all this, I'm glad I read it. It's good to read outside one's genre every once in awhile, if only to see what everyone else is reading.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23936720-misty,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"December 15, 2015",17 likes,0,"Have you ever connected with a book on such a deep, emotional level that it turned your whole world upside down? That it filled your life, your dreams, your every waking thought? That it felt like the author took a knife to your soul and let it bleed out all over the pages, resulting in this courageous piece of art, full of honesty and beauty and sorrow and joy? That you were left feeling exposed, embarrassed, encumbered, yet somehow free at the same time? I'm talking top down, sun on your face, hair blowing in the wind, listening to Taylor Swift on the radio free. Yeah it's complicated. But The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky was that book for me. I know I cannot write a review that will give this book the immense credit it deserves, but I must try.Charlie is sweet, and sensitive, and really, really smart. He's also socially awkward. Misunderstood by his family, shunned by his classmates, he's strange and shy, a wallflower, and now he's starting high school. There he meets Patrick and Sam. As high school seniors, they introduce Charlie to things like cigarettes, and parties, and alcohol, and most significantly, friendship. For the first time Charlie experiences true companionship. He is appreciated and valued. He is loved. The entire story is told from Charlie's perspective through letters written to his anonymous ""friend,"" a person he doesn't actually know. In these letters he reveals the highs and lows, the happiness and the struggles of his freshman year. And he bares his soul, his entire being, in the process. Serious subjects like rape, drugs, abortion, and suicide are addressed, so while this book is a short read, it isn't fluffy.I must mention the use of music and literature throughout this story. It's quite genius. They formed instant connections for me and deepened my understanding of Charlie. The music he chooses communicates not only his personal tastes but also his values, what he deems important. Even if you've never actually heard the songs Charlie connects to, you know the feeling of that connection. How music can comfort you or break you. How it says the things you can't find the words for. How it just ""gets you."" I love how Charlie uses music to express himself to his friends, like love letters telling them how he feels and what he wants for them.The literature mentioned throughout Perks is primarily books chosen by a teacher who befriends Charlie. Reading, like music, is a form of therapy for him. It is something he enjoys immensely. ""It is now my favorite book of all time, but then again, I always think that until I read another book."" (I totally get that Charlie.) The teacher uses this love of reading to not only challenge Charlie but to build a bond and grow trust as well. It really ends up being a wonderful message about the power of literature to connect us to one another (which is probably why book clubs are so popular). It reminds me of a quote from The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry. ""We read to know we're not alone. We read because we are alone. We read and we are not alone. We are not alone.""This book is a really difficult book to review without giving away anything. It is a love story, a coming of age story, one with a little bit of mystery if you are astute. The most powerful book review I've ever read was one where the reviewer explained why a book affected her in such a meaningful way. She shared intimate details of her life to help her readers understand the connection she made with the story. My heart's desire is to be that kind of writer, to go that deep and be that fearless, but to explain exactly why this particular book means so much to me would ruin the journey of discovery for you. And I really want you to experience it as it plays out, with fresh eyes and an open heart. This book is full of important and memorable quotes. I will leave you with a few of my favorites.“I would die for you. But I won't live for you.” This is originally from The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, one of the books Charlie's teacher assigned him to read.“And I guess I realized at that moment that I really did love her. Because there was nothing to gain, and that didn't matter.”“Please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And I will always believe the same about you.”“I am both happy and sad at the same time, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.”And the quote that best explains just why this story means the world to me,“So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there.""I know not everyone will connect with The Perks of Being a Wallflower like I did, and that's okay. We all have different life experiences that make us who we are. But, like all great literature, it still has much to offer those who don't relate to Charlie, or Patrick, or Sam - insight, understanding, and the opportunity to expand our humanity.Show more"

Temo che non esista, e non sono neanche troppo fiera di averla inventata. Però mi sembrava una definizione sintetica di ciò che penso di questo romanzo. Non è un genere di lettura che mi è abituale. La cosa più simile che mi viene in mente è Speak, di Laurie Halse Anderson, che non mi era affatto dispiaciuto, anche se non so quale sia l’opinione degli “esperti del settore” a riguardo. Dunque, posto che non so nulla di questo genere di narrativa, veniamo a parlare di ciò che mi interessa, ossia di Charlie. Dalle mie parti Charlie si potrebbe riassumere in un solo aggettivo, “cocchino”. Ma, giacché non è un’espressione nazional-popolare, mi sforzerò di tradurre passo passo. “Cocchino”, in riferimento a Charlie, sta per: commovente, delicato, sensibile, gentile, generoso, disponibile, ingenuo e al tempo stesso disincantato, sensibile un’altra volta, fresco, coraggioso. Un’anima bella, un’anima decisamente bella, che non si può fare a meno di amare. E non si può fare a meno di amarlo perché la sua voce è lieve come una campanella e mai patetica, è una voce che ti fa scendere un brivido lungo la schiena per la sua essenzialità e allo stesso tempo la sua completezza. E non so se voglio più bene a lui o allo scrittore che questa voce gli ha dato. Ma Charlie è anche più di questo. Un ragazzo trattato coi guanti di vetro (a metà tra un ragazzo trattato coi guanti e un ragazzo sotto una campana di vetro). La cosa che più colpisce, o almeno che più ha colpito me, è la delicatezza e la dolcezza dell’ambiente che lo circonda: una famiglia che non è perfetta, ma che sa come prenderlo, sa cosa dire e cosa fare per recuperarlo quando scende al fondo di se stesso, una famiglia che sa quando certe cose si possono dire e quando no, una famiglia che, se anche se non può conoscerlo del tutto (nessuno conosce mai del tutto nessun altro), sa interpretare le sue esigenze, ne ascolta i gesti e le espressioni, più che le parole, una famiglia che lo ama. Vorrei che tutte le famiglie fossero così. E non parliamo degli amici, di quei piccoli ritratti di umanità che sono Sam e Patrick e Brad e Mary Elizabeth (Patrick è il mio preferito, e Sam è Sam). E non parliamo di Bill, il professore che gli assegna libri da leggere perché capisce quanto Charlie sia speciale. Viene da chiedersi se non sia troppo, se in fondo lo scrittore non ci stia prendendo per il naso, se non costruisca tutta un’impalcatura di ambienti felici per farci invidia. Ma leggendo questo libro, nemmeno ci si fa caso, perché Charlie è così grande e così piccolo che sentiamo che si merita tutto quello che ha, mai qualcosa di meno. Charlie merita di affogare in questo mare di affetto e di “ti voglio bene”. E lo merita soprattutto perché Charlie è uno che soffre. No, forse dire che soffre è sbagliato. Charlie è uno che lotta, lotta contro se stesso per ristabilire un proprio equilibrio, lotta per fare ciò che è giusto fare, ossia vivere, essere presente a se stesso, lotta per cambiare, lotta per andare avanti, lotta per non precipitare, per non tagliarsi “i suoi dannatissimi polsi” come il ragazzo della poesia, per non lasciarsi andare, lotta per non pensare. E Charlie non può pensare perché c’è qualcosa, dentro di lui, che se ci pensasse lo annienterebbe. Ma questo non è importante, e non c’è bisogno che lo sappiate. “Immagino che siano tanti i fattori che ci fanno essere come siamo. Molti, forse, non li conosceremo mai. Ma, anche se non possiamo essere noi a decidere da dove veniamo, possiamo scegliere la nostra meta. Ci sono altre cose che possiamo fare. Cercando di sentirci a posto” dice lui. Ecco, questo significa che in fondo siamo tutti Charlie, tutti abbiamo qualcosa che ci annienta e tutti ci sforziamo di overcome, di andare oltre, di “sentirci a posto”. E tutti vorremmo persone che ci trattino coi guanti di vetro mentre stiamo cercando un equilibrio. Vorrei fare i complimenti allo scrittore per come ha saputo scrivere questo libro senza prostituirsi neanche un po’. Cosa intendo per “prostituirsi”? Sarebbe mettere frasi a effetto ogni tanto, indulgere nel sentimentalismo, infilarci pensieri suoi e non di Charlie. No, Chbosky, per grazia divina o onestà intellettuale, non ci dà niente di più di quanto sia necessario, ed è una cosa che ho molto apprezzato, perché conferisce grande realismo alla narrazione ed evita quel risultato di trito-già-visto-già-sentito che è la cosa che mi manda più in bestia in un romanzo. Signor Chbosky, tante grazie per Charlie e grazie anche di avermi indicato una via. “Ci sono altre cose che possiamo fare”. Grazie grazie grazie. La poesia è bellissima, ma i polsi vorrei tenermeli e se ci riesce Charlie posso farcela anch’io. Show more"

ALFAGUARA, 18ª edición. 264 páginas. Relaciones varias, LGBT, traumas, música, amistad, juvenil… Después de ver la película, tenía que leer el libro: estaba casi segura de que me gustaría un poquito más… Así fue. La película, con su… ambigua carga, es encantadora, aunque todos los actores no me encanten, pero sí descubrí al ‘’hermanastro’’ y me cayó bien enseguida. Aparte del prota más prota. ¿Y qué decir de la BSO?, en la foto de mi reseña tenéis una pista… Este libro es de los que te confirman que a veces, actores, directores, y la propia audiencia, limitan a los personajes a hacer su trabajo: no presentes un papel homosexual si no va a parecer algo más auténtico. Ejemplo: la situación homosexual-‘’heteropasiva’’…, se trata con descripciones más explícitas en el libro, y por lo tanto más creíbles. Y las excusas de que si es una peli juvenil, o que todavía estamos en… las cavernas, no me cuela. He visto lesbianas dar besos con lengua a actores masculinos y heteros, supuestamente… y no creo que hayan tenido que hacer terapia. Y eso que el prota gay, es gay en la vida real. En fin, llamarme hetero inconformista, pero es como ir al museo y que tapen parte del cuadro. Aunque existen actores de películas y series LGBT que han hecho papeles muy trabajados y conseguidos, y, algo más se están destapando algunos actores, o los que los dirigen, o pagan, en la actualidad; pero sigue siendo un tema delicado y ya no estamos en las cavernas…, donde quizás había más ‘’movimiento’’, pensándolo mejor. En esta historia te encuentras con un prota algo suyo, por decirlo así. Nos explica, vamos a decir también, a nosotros… sus cosillas… Su mundo familiar, el mundo que lo rodea, o no… sus recuerdos: ¿los selectivos? Y quizás te sientas comprendido y hasta te salga una sonrisa o/y una lágrima…  La escritura puede ser liberadora, o una caja de secretos… ¿Por qué no?, algunos no sabrán leer entre líneas nunca. Y la mente… lo que cabe en la mente puede ser el mismo mundo. En fin, hay que salir a éste, a veces por propia voluntad, por algo que te llama la atención, o por la misma necesidad, que puede que te esté llamando desde hace ya mucho… Aunque recuerda que sales si te da la gana, ¿eh? Y, ¡oye!, que puede ser que no estés tan solo como creías: que pueden haber otros como tú, como ya nos dice el título, de algún modo. Porque las personas somos únicas, pero no tanto… A partir de ahí, el prota va a experimentar nuevos sabores, malas situaciones y buenas, porque la vida es así. Malos momentos y momentos inolvidables, que pueden sacar a relucir otros… La vida es un examen constante. Nunca aprendes lo suficiente, aunque creas que ya lo sabes todo. Pues no. Y así te vas enterando, que está bien para no crecerse, mientras vas creciendo.  Me encanta la sensación de ir en coche con mi música preferida (un montón de artistas, vamos…), así que una parte de mí se une a la fiesta. Otra también entiende… otras partes no tan divertidas de esta historia, por desgracia.Tiern@, salvaje, necesari@, human@...Show more"

I’ve just finished it for the second time and I’ve decided to write a review for it as it’s my favourite book. Ever.I love this book for many reasons (side note, this review may not have much structure to it as I may end up just gushing about how much I love this book). One thing I love is it feels so real. I can hear Charlie’s voice when I read, he feels like such a real person. The writing is amazing in the way that it’s not perfect. It shows Charlie’s imperfections and the style of writing, down to each sentence, perfectly fits with his character. I love Charlie’s character. I find myself feeling so connected to him. I think we’re really similar, we both love books and music, have a few close friends, are introverted and going along with the title, a wallflower. I am practically the definition of wallflower, so you can imagine how alike I am to Charlie (though I consider myself to be a bit less awkward than him haha). I’ve also had a few similar experiences as him, dealing with depression and anxiety especially, and just being a teenager in general. It’s really nice to see a book that I feel like I can relate to in that sense. Moving away from Charlie a bit, all the characters in this book are so beautifully written. I love how they all have their flaws, just like real people. The relationships between Charlie and the other characters (mainly Patrick and Sam) remind me to cherish the time I have at home, with my own family and friends.There’s so many things I can’t even begin to explain about this book that make me love it, but I guess i’ll try. I love how I’ve only read this book twice but it feels like I’ve been reading it for years, and could read it everyday for the rest of my life. I love how the book is just people being people. No crazy plot, it’s so interesting yet so basic at the same time. The way the novel follows Charlie’s life is so captivating. Though sometimes a letter is just what he did that day, every sentence is interesting to read and adds more to his character and the book in general. I love how it’s written in letters, so different from any book I’ve ever read and it really shows. I love how the book conveys so many different emotions. Cheerful, sad, sympathy, infinite. I think infinite is quite honestly the best way to describe a book like this. I love how this book gets you to think about life, I feel like everyone can take away something from it. If you’ve never read this book, I strongly recommend it. The movie is great too, it also happens to be my favourite movie. Anyway if you came here looking for a real review then sorry, this definitely wasn’t it. But I hope I’ve given you the push you need to read it if you’ve been meaning to for awhile. Show more"

I have read The Perks of Being a Wallflower three times now and I still love it. A young adult coming-of-age story, it is an epistolary novel, in this case written in the form of intimate letters to an anonymous friend by our protagonist, Charlie. Charlie is a shy, introverted and sensitive teenager who has just embarked on his journey through high school. We follow him over the course of his freshman year as he makes new friends and struggles with many of the challenges of adolescence, all the while dealing with the suicide of his best friend, and the death of his aunt Helen and the family drama that accompanies that. Bill, Charlie's English teacher, notices how insightful and intelligent he is and acts as a mentor by assigning him extracurricular books and reports to encourage his passion for reading and writing. Published in 1999 but set in the early 90s just before the internet was made publicly available, this novel deals with many themes that permeate the adolescent experience, including first love, sex and sexuality, masturbation, and drug and alcohol use. It also tackles some more upsetting topics like sexual abuse, rape, violence, abortion and mental illness. For this reason, the book was banned in some American schools for its content.I love that this story is presented from Charlie's perspective; we are provided with a first-hand account of Charlie's thinking and how he reacts to his own unique problems, before his experiences are filtered by other people's opinions. His all-out honesty in describing his feelings makes for both an intimate and very sad read, but I loved being right there to witness his transformative journey. Ultimately, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is about navigating between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and choosing to participate in life instead of standing on the sidelines.It is a rare occurrence, but the film adaptation is just as good as the book. And the soundtrack is incredible.
""So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we’ll never know most of them. But even if we don’t have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.""

This book had been among my pending readings for years and, honestly, my expectations were higher.It tells us the story of Charlie, a 15-year-old boy who, at all seems his real age. The way of expressing himself and many things make him look like a 5-year-old boy and that took away a lot of realism, in addition to making him feel less connected to the protagonist.I highlight it wonderful phrases and the original fact that, being a youth book, does not give full importance to love relationships, as in most of these happens. It also gives a lot of importance to family and friends, and I think it is very good to show us that love as a couple is not everything.The book entertained me, yes, but it did not get me hooked at all and, as I said, I failed to connect with the characters. In addition, the end seems quite inconclusive. They drop the bomb that you had all the book waiting for, and hala, it ends. It does not clear up very well and I would have liked a slightly more closed end.
Español
Este libro llevaba años entre mis lecturas pendientes y, sinceramente, mis expectativas eran más altas.Nos cuenta la historia de Charlie, un chico de 15 años que, para nada parece su edad real. La manera de expresarse y muchas cosas hacen que parezca un niño de 5 años y eso le quitó bastante realismo, además de que hizo que me sintiera menos conectada al protagonista.Destaco de él sus maravillosas frases y el original hecho de que, siendo un libro juvenil, no le da la total importancia a las relaciones amorosas, como en la mayoría de estos pasa. Le da mucha importancia también a la familia y amistades, y me parece muy bien que nos muestre que el amor de pareja no lo es todo.El libro me entretuvo, sí, pero no llegó a engancharme del todo y, como ya dije, no conseguí conectar con los personajes. Además, el final me parece bastante inconcluso. Te sueltan el bombazo que llevabas todo el libro esperando, y hala, termina. No lo aclara muy bien y me hubiera gustado un final un poco más cerrado.Show more"

I am reading it in my english class and I had this book sitting my bookshelf for a while (BTW, I bought this copy in a charity shop in Wales for 65p) and I probably wouldn't have picked it up until all of my other books had been read (in other words, never).The first chapter in I was...well...to be honest...not exactly impressed. I just didn't really like Charlie. He cries all.the.time. At first, I thought it was just me at first (I'm not a very emotional person) but I asked my classmates and they all agreed with me so...I think we can all agree that Charlie is a very sensetive boy. Other than that I really loved the story, characters and the writing. I'm not really used to reading books as letters, but it felt very personal and also made me pay more attention because I thought I was his ""dear friend"". *But I couldn't give it 5 stars just because of Charlie's oversensetive personality.I actually just found out something deeply disturbing that happens in this book. The message of that situation is incredibly powerful and the way it was written impacts the actual message in an even more powerful way. Honestly, I am still shocked after realizing what happend to Charlie. I actually realized it after watching the movie (which was literally 5 minutes ago) and I didn't really understand what they meant. So I looked it and I think I'll leave it at that.* I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.Show more"

This is a portrait of how life was in the early 90s, how issues so complex are seen through Charlie's innocent eyes.

I don't think this book would have worked any other way.I am giving it 5 stars not because it made me fall in love and obsess with its characters, but because it broke my heart.

He was simple, yet complex at the same time (I think he spent half of the book crying!), quirky, compassionate, and caring, yet very passive, finding it safer to be a wallflower than a participant in life. The book dealt with lots of issues such as death, homosexuality, abortion, drugs etc. I liked the format of the book, which was a series of letters sent to an unidentified recipient.The way Charlie wrote definitely made him likeable. I decided to give the book 4-stars instead of 5 for a few reasons.What I didn't quite understand is why Charlie wrote like a much younger child (I would say he wrote like an 8 year old) if he was truly as gifted as his teacher said. Also,because of his naivete, it quite surprised me that he could easily become friendly with the popular kids (and how could he be that naive being a teenager in the 90s?)

""Las noches en las que ligaba con alguien siempre lo entristecían"". ""Es verdad que me está pasando algo.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876333-anthony-chavez,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"September 20, 2012",16 likes,0,"Angst. This book has it. In a novella sized read Chbosky manages to cram suicide, domestic abuse, alcoholism, drugs, bullying, homosexuality, and... did I forget anything else? Oh yeah, the main character Charlie is extremely gifted but also borderline schizophrenic. I'm not sure what the author's intent is including all this depressing material - maybe he wants everyone to have something to relate to; however, the inundation of angst for me did exactly the opposite. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" feeds into the misconception that all teens have depressing and depraved lives, that they are ""emo"" if you will. Charlie wasn't unrelatable to me though, there were things I did that he did at his age. Charlie's narrative, in the form of letters, is endearing and insightful and harkened me back not too long ago when I read Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The unique delivery of the story definitely scores it points. There are some people who will love this book and hail it as an eye-opening look into adolescence. But to me at points in the book, its too much melodrama, sometimes feeling forced.One thing Chbosky does fairly well is depicting the psyche of its teenager protagonist. Using the aforementioned letters (or diary) form narration you become acquainted with the life and times of Charlie, a teenager, who is not ""cool"" or in any way popular (thus ""wallflower""), but who paints his world for you as he tries to cope with: growing up, friendship, learning, failing, failing again, sometimes succeeding, losing friends, and everything the growing up journey at that particular age involves. Naturally, it has themes that everyone that has been a teenager is to one degree or another familiar with. Drugs, experimenting with sexuality, learning about emotions, trying to interpret, trying to define the everyday reality he's into.Chbosky succeeds and I'm convinced, the story feels like it was written by a teenager. I personally caught myself reminiscing every now and again as i went through the sometimes simplistic questions that Charlie poses. That speaks volumes, catching yourself reminiscing while reading a story is a good sign, it means the author is doing their job well. ""The perks of being a wallflower"" is also full of many humorous moments the kind of ""funniness"" that emerges when you are learning about life and commit yourself to mistakes or situations that might seem to you as super tragic or critical but they are just part of the process of growing up and later on you reinstate them for what they really are.What also drew this rating up to 3-stars is the references. I am a sucker for pop culture references in books, they drive home the reality of things and bring situations more down to Earth making them relatable. In the novel Charlie loves the song ""Asleep"" by The Smiths""There is this one photograph of Sam that is just beautiful. It would be impossible to describe how beautiful it is, but I’ll try. If you listen to the song “Asleep”, and you think about those pretty weather days that make you remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes you’ve ever known, and you cry, and the person holds you back, then I think you will see the photograph.""Charlie even made a sweet Christmas mixed tape for his best friend that included these great songs: ""Scarborough Fair"" by Simon and Garfunkel""Time of No Reply"" by Nick Drake""Nights In White Satin"" by The Moody Blues ""Daydream"" by The Smashing Pumpkins ""Blackbird"" by The Beatles""Landslide"" by Fleetwood MacRecommended reading not only for those that want to compare notes of their past (or even present) but especially for those bringing up kids or working with them. It's one thing to have been there and another to remember what it really feels like going through it. And when it comes to describing the ""feeling"" of it all, the helplessness and the agony or the angst of teenagehood ""The perks..."" definitely has the angst in that department. A good decent read. 3- Stars.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4686064-rajat-ubhaykar,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"March 7, 2015",16 likes,0,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the coming-of-age story of a lonely, shy, volatile 15-year old called Charlie who is both happy and sad and is trying to figure out how that could be. This is an epistolary novel where the chapters are a series of letters that a disillusioned and emotionally vulnerable Charlie writes to his diary imagining it to be a person, having heard that it listened and understood and didn’t try to sleep with that person at that party even though it could have. Due to this introspective format, we get an intimate view into Charlie’s mind.Charlie, though a 15 year old is mentally a prepubescent boy. He is ill-informed about sex and is eccentrically introverted. Being a social outsider he brings with him a clear-sighted quality that cuts through the gloss and superficiality that surrounds high school interactions. He is a wallflower, he sees things, he keeps quiet and most importantly, he understands. His distance from the status quo culture gives him unique insights into the contemporary condition given that his life story is a running commentary on teenage social issues like date rape, drug abuse, sexual deviation, homosexual experimentation and pervasive consumerism. He narrates this with a calm detachment that seems slightly unnatural. But for the most part he is sensitive, highly intelligent and occasionally charming in an entertaining narrative mix.Though initially a loner and a crybaby, he is soon befriended by a gang of older hipster kids who turn his world topsy-turvy. It is with these older people that he experiences the exhilaration of growing up in bad company. He falls in love, discovers music, smokes his first cigarette, smokes dope, drops acid and learns how to be social. His benefactors are a motley crew populated by fringe members of society; homosexuals, punk rockers and hyper-intellectuals. Charlie is particularly infatuated with a stepbrother stepsister duo; happily gay Patrick and enigmatic Sam.Chbosky’s writing is simple and precise and is mostly easy reading. The plot is engaging and we are immersed in Charlie’s world for all those hours we spend with the book in hand. Charlie’s world, though rich, textured and filled with detail was sometimes a little too whiny for my taste. What brought down my final rating of the book is that it did not stay with me after I’d finished it. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not the contemporary Catcher in the Rye (which is referenced multiple times) that it is reputed to be. It is not a timeless ageless classic that somewhere stops being just about a lonely, introspective teenager and starts addressing all of humanity. The Perks of Wallflower is a well-written Young Adult novel which captured a year in the life of young Charlie and with it, the popular imagination successfully.Cross-posted from IndiaBookStoreShow more"

However thats not what happened because it took me about a week to get over with this book. The reason why this happened is that I found this book to be the one that I felt like savouring. The emotions that Charlie makes the reader oscillate between are tremendous. At one point I felt sad, then there was happiness, then I felt sad again and so on. While reading this book, there was a certain heaviness that I felt in my heart. Now this can be because of the honesty and simplicity with which Charlie narrated his story. Here we had a protagonist who went through a lot mental trauma and is prone to an emotional breakdown every now and then and yet he has an innate zeal to live life to the fullest. He feels lost, he feels trapped but he carries on nevertheless. He falls in love, he gets into fights, he cries, he gets numb. Basically he does it all.The message that I grasped from this wonderful story is that we are here to live no matter what. We grapple with depression, insecurity and every horrible emotion but we must feel everything and learn from it and move on in life with hope.The end shocked me because what was revealed was clearly something I wasn't expecting, but then again I thought, isn't this something very real? Does this not happen with a lot of children? The experiences of childhood play a defining role in a person's life. Many incidents of childhood shape up our personalities as adults. Charlie's character is extremely perceptive and he feels a lot of emotions and his observation is stellar. However, another thing that this story taught me is that we should talk it out. We should talk to the people we care about and we should know what's happening in the lives of the people we care about.The message that there is always hope and we should never give up on life has been conveyed beautifully through this story.Show more"

Charlie's story is one of tragedy and personal demons, and a how to live with them. I'd really like to be able to say that Charlie won over his demons, but that's, i think one of the many important things that we learn in this book. We are never really rid of our demons. They're always lurking in the dark just... waiting. So our goal, or our mission, is not to find endless ways of how to obliterate them for good, but to find ways to cope with them and learn to be the better person. Not let them get you down, and not let them make you forget just how truly special and lovely you are. Charlie's this really deep and complex human being, and I appreciate that so much from him. He's not this shallow person who just goes about his life without really questioning what he's doing. He stops and considers his life choices and he tries to see if he's going in the right path. He has his own standards and he has learned to question everything. It has made him fall into this depression that we see him trying to fight over and over again, but I think we also learn that even though Charlie went through all of those turmoils, at the end it was worth it. Oh so worth it.AS YOU CAN SEE, this book taught me so many things, and as a coming of age novel I give it a 5 stars rating. It was done so exceptionally and it will forever hold a special place in my heart. Woohoo Charlie! Show more"

Hij was in de uitverkoop voor 1,50. Mijn zusje heeft de Engelse versie maar die heeft ze al een tijdje uitgeleend aan een vriendin, dus kocht ik maar de Nederlandse versie omdat ik heel benieuwd was naar het boek.De belevenissen van een muurbloem gaan over Charlie, een hyperintelligente, gevoelige, ongemakkelijke en verlegen jongen. Hij heeft een vervelende jeugd gehad en hij gaat naar de bovenbouw. Hij heeft geen vrienden, maar in het schooljaar komt hij in contact met Patrick en zijn stiefzus Sam. De drie worden vrienden en Charlie ontdekt via hen de wereld van feesten, drugs en seks en familiedrama's. In een briefvorm vertelt Charlie zijn verhaal.Dit boek staat bij mij nu echt op mijn favoriete lijst van boeken en ik ben van plan dit boek echt nog meerdere keren te gaan herlezen. Ik vind het zonde dat ik er niet eerder aan begonnen ben, want het is zo'n goed boek! Hoewel ik vooral van de fantasy ben, vond ik dit boek erg intrigerend.Charlie is de hoofdpersoon in het boek en schrijft brieven naar je over zijn leven. Hij noemt je telkens lieve vriend en sluit ook telkens af met veel liefs, Charlie. Door deze briefvorm krijg je echt een persoonlijke kijk op het leven van Charlie. Je krijgt een heel goed beeld van wat hij voelt en meemaakt door de brieven. Charlie schrijft ook gewoon op wat hij denkt en daardoor kan je erg goed met hem meeleven.De verhaallijn is ook goed in elkaar gezet. Je ziet langzaamaan karakterontwikkeling bij verschillende personages en bepaalde dingen worden nog verzwegen zodat het even duurt voordat je achter alle geheimen komt, waardoor je in een snelvaart dit boek wilt lezen. Charlie heeft wat dingen in zijn verleden meegemaakt die niet prettig zijn, en uiteindelijk kom je er achter wat zo veel impact op zijn leven heeft gehad. Daarbij wordt het verhaal afgewisseld met humor, verdriet, liefde, spanning en nog veel meer. Ik moet bekennen dat ik bijna nooit huil bij boeken, maar bij dit boek heb ik me soms zo verdrietig gevoeld dat zelfs mijn ogen vochtig werden. Dit is heel zeldzaam, Chbosky heeft hierdoor echt een hele prestatie verricht.Ook vond ik de personages indrukwekkend in dit boek. Om te beginnen met Charlie. Hij is superintelligent, hij is een muurbloem waardoor hij nooit echt in de belangstelling staat. Daarbij zal hij nooit iemand pijn willen doen en hij is ook erg gevoelig, waardoor hij vaak moet huilen. Ik vind Charlie een complex personage waardoor het erg interessant was om een kijkje te nemen in zijn gedachtegang en leven. Ik kon af en toe ook dingen in Charlie herkennen die ik zelf ook heb. Hoewel ik niet een huilebalk ben zoals Charlie zijn er ook dingen die impact in mijn leven hebben gehad waardoor je er vaak over nadenkt, en dat had Charlie vaak. Charlie hoopte ook voor iedereen dat degene gelukkig is, en af en toe komt die gedachte ook bij mij op. Wel had ik het idee dat Charlie misschien autistisch is. Hij is zo ongemakkelijk met relaties en vriendschappen en is erg slim, daarbij kan je eventueel linkjes leggen met autisme. Niet dat dat erg is, maar het viel me wel op. Dat maakt Charlie misschien ook zo interessant, omdat hij ondanks zijn karakter vriendschappen sluit en ook aan de drugs gaat. Charlie is een vredelievend en hartverwarmend persoon waardoor je als lezer al snel om Charlie geeft. Gelukkig ben ik zelf niet depressief zoals Charlie af en toe kon zijn! Charlies aandoenlijke persoonlijkheid zorgde er in ieder geval voor dat je erg met hem meeleeft en met hem mee kon lachen en kon huilen.Andere personages zoals Patrick en Sam zijn ook interessant, aangezien zij hun eigen problemen hebben die langzamerhand duidelijk beginnen te worden. Zelfs de kleine rollen hebben zo hun kleine geheimen of karaktertrekken zodat je je makkelijk thuis gaat voelen in het leven van Charlie.Ook was ik zo onder de indruk van alle mooie quotes in het boek en de gedachtegangen van Charlie. Het zette mij in ieder geval erg tot nadenken en dit is ook één van de redenen dat ik dit boek nog vaak ga herlezen. Neem nou deze passage, uit 14 oktober 1991, een gesprek tussen Charlie en zijn leraar:Bill glimlachte en stelde me nog meer vragen . Geleidelijk kwam hij bij de 'problemen in de thuissituatie'. En ik vertelde hem dat de jongen die mixtapes maakt mijn zus had geslagen omdat mijn zus alleen tegen me had gezegd dat ik het niet tegen pap en man mocht zeggen, dus ik dacht dat ik het best aan Bill kon vertellen. Nadat ik dit aan hem had verteld werd zijn gezicht heel serieus en hij zei iets tegen me waarvan ik niet denk dat ik het dit semester of zelfs ooit nog zal vergeten.'Charlie, we nemen genoegen met de liefde die we denken te verdienen.'Net als Charlie bleef deze zin een tijdje lang in mijn hoofd spoken. We nemen genoegen met de liefde die we denken te verdienen. Ik heb er lang over nagedacht, en zelf ben ik geen voorstander van deze zin, en dat zit als volgt. Neem ik genoegen met de liefde die ik denk te verdienen? Nee, ik denk het niet. Wat nou als ik in werkelijkheid weinig liefde verdien omdat ik een slecht persoon ben, maar ik krijg wel veel liefde en neem ook genoegen met deze liefde, terwijl ik dit niet verdien? Of als ik juist erg veel liefde verdien, maar te min over mezelf denk zodat ik genoegen neem met minder liefde, terwijl ik eigenlijk meer verdien? Ik zou liever genoegen nemen met de liefde die anderen mij gunnen of de liefde waarvan andere mensen denken dat ik die verdien. Ach ja, ik dacht weer een beetje te veel na... Over 1 zin... Pfff....Dit boek staat echt vol met quotes of gedachtes van Charlie die me echt zijn bijgebleven en wat stof tot nadenken is.Ook brengt Chbosky heel veel onderwerpen naar voren in dit boek die erg controversieel zijn. Veel discussies zijn bij dit boek gekomen en het werd voor sommige scholieren ook verboden om dit boek te lezen voor school. In dit boek komen veel onderwerpen zoals drugs, seks, homoseksualiteit, abortus aan bod, wat voor veel opschudding zorgde. Zelf vind ik het erg dapper dat Chbosky zo over de streep durfde te gaan. Dit boek houdt jou en ook vele andere tieners nog jaren in zijn greep door de inhoud en de personages.Ik kan nog lang doorgaan met het ophemelen van dit boek, maar ik laat het hier maar bij. De belevenissen van een muurbloem vind ik in ieder geval een meesterwerk en zal waarschijnlijk nog over een paar decennia nog steeds in mijn boekenkast staan. Petje af voor Stephen Chbosky! Ik wil binnenkort ook de film gaan zien, ik ben in ieder geval erg nieuwsgierig naar hoe ze bepaalde stukken hebben verfilmd!http://nerdygeekyfanboy.com/recensie/...Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29399837-minh-nh-n-nguy-n,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"May 21, 2019",15 likes,0,"3,5 sao.Cuốn này quả thật khá hơn những cuốn young adult khác mình đọc, nhân vật có chiều sâu thực sự chứ không phải chỉ thể hiện bằng những câu từ đao to búa lớn còn nội dung thì nông cạn, hời hợt.Sách viết dưới dạng những bức thư Charlie gởi cho một người bạn bí ẩn, qua đó kể lại những sự việc xảy ra từ lúc cậu bước vào trường trung học, và ảnh hưởng của chúng lên con người vốn mang nhiều khác biệt như cậu. Với cách viết tâm tình đó cho phép Charlie bộc lộ hết suy nghĩ, cảm xúc của mình, cả những cảm xúc mà chính cậu cũng không giải thích nổi.Nửa đầu sách đọc rất thích, khi song song với việc khám phá những thứ mới lạ ở trường còn là việc giới thiệu về bối cảnh gia đình Charlie, những người họ hàng của cậu. Có lẽ cũng là do mình thích đọc những câu chuyện nhỏ nhặt thân tình như vậy. Charlie có một gia đình đáng tự hào, khi bố và mẹ đều quan tâm đến cậu và có rất nhiều những thứ hay ho để kể về họ.Những dịp họ hàng tụ hợp cũng gợi nên không khí ấm áp, tuy nhiên khi đọc sẽ có cảm giác có nhiều chi tiết còn để mở, về một nhân vật, sự kiện nào đó ở quá khứ được nhắc thoáng qua chứ chưa được tiết lộ. Đọc càng về sau thì những khoảng trống ấy sẽ càng được lấp đầy và bức tranh toàn cảnh hiện ra rõ hơn, mọi chuyện sẽ được giải thích hợp lý hơn. Nó làm cho mình có cảm giác câu chuyện khá chân thật, rằng những vấn đề đó đã xuất hiện ngay từ đầu, và vẫn luôn ở đó chứ không phải mọi thứ ban đầu được thể hiện hoàn hảo, đẹp đẽ để sau này mới tiết lộ những góc cạnh bên trong đó.Ai cũng bảo nước Mỹ là xứ văn minh nhưng nếu đúng như những bộ phim hay nh��ng cuốn sách mình đọc thì quả thật chưa thấy nơi nào lại nông cạn, rỗng tuếch như những trường trung học Mỹ. Các trò bắt nạt, phân biệt, xúc phạm lẫn nhau có lẽ là chuyện cơm bữa khi mà đọc cuốn sách nào về đề tài này cũng thấy thế. Và tất cả đều xuất phát từ những cái đầu nông nổi xem trường trung học bé tí ấy là toàn thể vũ trụ này vậy. Có lẽ mình không được ""may mắn"" sinh sống và lớn lên ở một xứ văn minh như vậy nên thời niên thiếu trôi qua khá là yên ả, nhàm chán chăng.Thật ra thì bắt nạt học đường cũng không phải là vấn đề chính trong cuốn này, chỉ bởi mình đã khá mệt mỏi khi luôn bắt gặp phải những tình tiết đó trong các sách nói về trường trung học Mỹ. Vả lại tuy ít nói, cô lập nhưng Charlie không phải là mẫu nhân vật chỉ biết co mình khi bị bắt nạt mà luôn phản kháng khi có ai làm tổn thương cậu hay bạn bè cậu. Và Charlie đánh rất cừ, chẳng hề thua ai đâu nhé.Nãy giờ coi như là khen đi nhỉ, giờ thì đến phần tạm gọi là chê này. Mình có đọc nhận xét của ai đó rút ra từ cuốn này rằng ""ai cũng cần có những người bạn như Pattrick và Sam"", và có lẽ đó cũng là ý đồ của tác giả khi xây dựng 2 nhân vật này. Nhưng thực sự khi đọc thì mình lại không thích 2 người bạn này cho lắm.Charlie là một cậu bé có nhiều biến động lớn trong cảm xúc, khi vui khi buồn không giải thích được, vậy mà khi gặp nhau họ không nhận thấy sự thay đổi đó ở Charlie. Và cũng không biết rằng mỗi lần gặp gỡ với mình, mỗi cú điện thoại mình gọi có ý nghĩa với Charlie như thế nào, có thể níu kéo lấy cậu nhưng cũng có thể đẩy cậu vào vực sâu cảm xúc. Để rồi cậu phải gục ngã trong cơn suy sụp chỉ mong đợi mãi một cuộc điện thoại. Có lẽ tác giả muốn tạo ra 2 nhân vật hồn nhiên, yêu đời, đáng mến nhưng mình lại thấy họ khá hời hợt, vô tâm thì đúng hơn.Riêng Sam có lẽ được xây dựng như một hình tượng cô nàng trong mộng: lớn tuổi hơn, chính chắn hơn và luôn ngọt ngào, dễ mến. Rõ là Charlie say mê cô ngay từ lần đầu gặp nhưng có cảm giác cô xem cậu như một món đồ chơi, hết thẳng thừng bảo cậu thôi mơ mộng đến cô rồi lại nhiều lần mơn trớn, ""mời gọi"", tạo hy vọng nơi cậu mà không biết rằng Charlie đã phải trăn trở nhiều về tình cảm của mình. Và đến cuối cùng cô cũng có một lý do hợp lý cho những hành động đầy mâu thuẫn của mình, chỉ trách là Charlie không hiểu được tâm sự của cô. Ừ, cái thằng nhóc nhỏ hơn mình mấy tuổi đó, cái thằng mắc chứng bệnh tâm lý, không có mối quan hệ nào, chẳng hiểu gì một cô gái lõi sự đời như mình cả.Mình cũng thấy Charlie thật đáng trách. Nhưng không phải với Sam mà là với Mary kìa. Biết rằng cậu ở thế khó xử trong mối quan hệ với Mary khi không dứt khoát, thật lòng với cô, chính cậu cũng hiểu điều đó nhưng lại cứ dây dưa không giải quyết để rồi làm tổn thương cô theo một cách tệ hại nhất. Mình biết ý đồ tác giả khi xây dựng Mary không phải một cô gái dễ mến mà khá là khó chịu, việc cô ngay sau đó đã có bạn trai mới, rồi có thể đối xử với Charlie bình thường như trước đây cũng nhằm giảm bớt lỗi lầm của cậu. Nhưng như thế cũng không làm mình có cái nhìn cảm thông cho Charlie như lúc đầu nữa.Mình biết đó không phải là mục đích của tác giả khi tạo ra những nhân vật này. Trong văn hóa Mỹ thì mẫu nhân vật này hẳn sẽ tạo cảm tình, nhân vật kia thì đáng ghét, nhưng khi đọc bằng cái nhìn của chính mình thì lại cảm thấy như thế, nên đành xin lỗi tác giả vậy :).Nửa đầu truyện mình thấy rất hay vì nó thể hiện cái nhìn của Charlie, một cậu bé nhạy cảm, sâu sắc trước mọi thứ xung quanh mình, còn ở nửa sau, câu chuyện tập trung vào việc giải quyết các vấn đề của Charlie, và lúc đó mình cảm thấy nó cũng giống như bao cuốn young adult khác. Có điều chi tiết về người dì Helen của Charlie - chi tiết mấu chốt dẫn đến những chấn thương tâm lý cho cậu thì được nhắc tới khá mơ hồ. Mình chỉ biết Charlie có cảm giác tội lỗi cho cái chết của dì chứ không hiểu tại sao khi gần gũi với Sam cậu lại nghĩ đến dì ta và trở nên suy sụp như vậy. Chỉ đến khi xem phim chuyển thể, cảnh phim thể hiện chớp nhoáng qua thì mình mới bất ngờ khi biết Charlie đã bị dì Helen lạm dụng khi còn nhỏ @_@. Thật sự nếu không xem phim thì mình cũng không hiểu những lời ám chỉ về việc ""đụng chạm"" có nghĩa là gì. Theo như trong phim thì cho đến lúc bị ""breakdown"" ở tình tiết cao trào cuối thì Charlie mới nhận ra điều này, và có lẽ sau khi tha thứ cho dì ta rồi thì chứng rối loạn của cậu cũng sẽ được giải quyết.Nói chung thì cuốn này thể hiện một phần nào đó nét u tối ở trường học Mỹ thông qua cái nhìn của một nhân vật nhiều bất ổn như Charlie. Qua đó đề cao tầm quan trọng của tình bạn, tình yêu đẹp sẽ giúp con người vượt qua được giai đoạn khó khăn này (mà với mình vẫn chưa thấy thuyết phục :^). Không hẳn tương đồng về nội dung và đề tài nhưng nếu đã đọc và thích The fault in our stars mình nghĩ bạn cũng sẽ thích cuốn này :).Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17348951-joanna,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 1 out of 5,"August 6, 2018",19 likes,0,"Its taken me a long time to write a review for this book and this is mostly because I have a very unpopular opinion about it. This book has such cult following and a hype surrounding it that I felt a peer pressure to read it. Do you know what I mean? Its like when someone says they've never seen The Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off and you all give them the side eye and crazy look cause those movies were generational shaping classics. You get what I am saying, right ?!? Either way I felt compelled to read this book before the end of 2016 since this year has been fantastic for me in terms of my reading, reviewing and activeness on Goodreads.I went into this book not knowing anything about it expect how life changing it was suppose to be but the thing I just hated about it was that it was soooooo pretentious. The author decided to format this book in the form of journal entries/ letters describing all the absolutely mundane things that happen in the life of 15 year old Charlie during 1991 to 1992. These entries were all observations of events in Charlie's life in his first year of high school and I felt like some of these observations weren't written well enough to be understood fully. The use of flowery prose to describe a tree or a car ride through a tunnel, descriptions about how infinite it felt, were convoluted and messy at times. Charlie’s thoughts are incredibly hard to follow and the added obstacle of trying to deduce what is actually being said because of the writing was an annoyance. For example at some point Charlie was talking about how things are going at home and then all of a sudden he decided to go to a party that we don’t know anything about prior. While at this party we get a bunch of random descriptions of observations followed shortly afterwards by our character lying in the snow and at the end of the chapter stating ""Im never taking LSD again""....... Okay.... like when did he acquire LSD?!?!? WTF. You eventually learn that Charlie got it from a guy named Bob but were not introduced to Bob until page 142 which is after the event mentioned above. If you hate reading things in a linear fashion then this book is for you 👍🏾. Things like this irritate me cause the plot could have been straightforward but the author chose to complicate it unnecessarily.Charlie as a character seemed like a nice person but his total lack of moral compass was infuriating. At one point his brother decides to have a party and he is told to stay in his room. Some kids come into his room during that party and rape a girl while he is in the room pretending to sleep. He saw the whole thing and never said anything. Are you a monster ?!?! Why wouldn’t you say anything ? He sees another guy hit his sister and only told his teacher about it because the teacher asked how was his weekend. How does he just spit that out like if it ain’t no thang? Where is the outrage for his sister? Where is his empathy? Now its implied that Charlie had some mental instability but we don't know what his condition is in the story. That would have been too helpful. We know that he goes to a psychiatrist and takes medication but this story is trying to pass this stuff off as teenage awkwardness instead of a mental health issue. If the author wanted to write a book about mental health than he should have just done one and done it tastefully.The only thing that I found interesting in this book was the quote "" We accept the love we think we deserve"". This I thought was thought provoking. Other than that I didn't find this book life changing at all and I feel like it puts contemporary books in a bad light. Just random drivel for 200+ pages and with a holier than though feel. This totally reminded me of those books your teacher in school would make you read for English because it was part of the course syllabus and you asked yourself how on Earth did this get to be part of the curriculum. This book has left a sour taste in my mouth for the genre and I may take a break from it for a bit to recuperate.P.S. I did watch the movie after I read this book to see if things were better explained and/or flushed out now that the author/director had a different medium to try and express this supposedly life changing work but it still missed the mark. I think it missed it even further because it didn't show all the drug use Charlie was doing. The scene I was describing with the LSD happened in the movie as he was taking a wafer from the priest in mass. This was strange because if you'd never read the book then, based of the movie , you would’ve never thought Charlie would try recreational drugs. Then with Charlie accepting the wafer and laying it on his tongue you get transported to this party with flashing lights and heavy music. I almost thought the priest had given it to him. This convolution happens when artistry tries to supersede storytelling. Examples of beautiful artistry with fantastic storytelling: Romeo and Juliet (1996) directed by Baz Luhrmann and Upside Down (2012) by Juan Solanas. Both of theses movies were quirky and unique in their own way and managed to use flowery prose without losing the story being told. None of the writing in either was unnecessary and both conveyed a message that was important and could be understood.P.P.S. adding this part in Jan 3 2017. Today I learned how to use the link function on Goodreads. So I wanted to use it to link to a great review from another book lover who also gave it a 1 star rating but gave additional points I didn't mention in my own review.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

While I believe this book fully leaned on the outline of The Catcher in the Rye & it included every teenage angst and pain there is, it profoundly impacted how I felt when I read the final letter. Even in its predictability, Wallflower’s message is timeless and is true. Be alive. Feel it.

Al parecer, la incapacidad de Charlie para identificar cualquier emoción dentro de sí mismo además de la tristeza, su llanto constante, su falta de conocimiento (a la edad de 15 años) qué era la masturbación, su incapacidad para comprender cualquier situación social (como una violación mientras era testigo de su adolescencia) era indicativo de alguna forma de autismo o simplemente de inmadurez mental severa. Esto, pensé entonces, era demasiado explotador. En ese momento, solo una víctima de cáncer (o SIDA) faltaba en esta narración ya súper grave y emocionalmente manipuladora.Pero, resultó que estaba muy equivocado. Charlie era, evidentemente, solo un estudiante tímido, socialmente incómodo, que asistía a clases de AP, extremadamente talentoso y observador con un oscuro secreto. Al menos, así fue descrito por otras personas. ¡¿Qué?! ¿Qué dice sobre las habilidades de escritura de Stephen Chbosky si su narrador adolescente supuestamente inteligente suena como un niño de 7 años? Si la escritura de Charlie reflejaba su discurso e interacciones, ¿cómo podría hacerse amigo de una multitud de geniales niños mayores e incluso tener novias, todas las cuales pensaban que él era lo mejor desde el pan rebanado?Puedo atribuir la popularidad de esta novela solo a la gran variedad de oportunidades de lágrimas, momentos de enseñanza y lecciones de vida de la historia, entregadas suavemente por el narrador siempre tan sabio y profundo. Esto ni siquiera es lo suficientemente controvertido como para merecer todas esas prohibiciones.2 estrellas para momentos de interés.Show more"

I know that this book is very popular but I just didn't fall head over heels in love with it. I thought I was going to enjoy this much more then I did due to the fact that all of my friends have raved about it. I can understand why some people loved this but it just wasn't anything special to me and it seemed highly overrated. This book was so bad that putting it down left me more confused then if I hadn't read it. I was left with so many questions. For example: How are we going to not talk about the fact that this book included suicide, mental illness, alcohol, drugs, sexual orientation, first-time-sex, incest, abuse, rape, abortion, etc., etc., but didn't once discuss how people overcame it? It was just one day someone had this issue and the next, they were fine. And how is the psychiatrist not going to mention that Charlie is either very emotionally stunted or is on the spectrum? How did a 15 year old boy get away with becoming friends with the cool seniors but would cry at any nice or sad gesture IN FRONT OF THEM every few minutes. I think it is great that it was made to seem normal because boys should be allowed to cry, but this was abnormal and not realistic! Oh, and how was this book written like a child but Bill was completely blown away by Charlie's writing skills and how special he was? Overall, this book was poorly written and I resented the fact that none of the heavy topics were properly addressed. I debated between giving this one and two stars because I did still finish reading it and it was a way to pass the time.Show more"

I loved the way that it was written in a letter format. I loved seeing the world through Charlie's eyes. This book was a very real look at a 15-year-old boy's introduction to being a freshman. The book letters are dated in the early 1990s, when many ""topics"" were more sensitive, such as homophobia. Charlie wanting to feel and being so numb to so much in life really comes to a head. He was so sad and yet had such a huge heart. The anxiety that he felt was well captured, as well as trying to figure out life and girls. Although I had suspicions, the ending was still quite shocking. This was a book that was hard to put down as I wanted to know the rest of the story. It was easy to get lost within the pages and was entertaining. It is easy to see how it got turned into a movie.

Yet the story swepped me up and I soon found myself awaiting Charlie’s next letter, and the next, and the next - until I’d read the whole book, and said goodbye to all the characters – and particularly to Charlie whom I’d grown rather fond of. I can see how this has become a classic. Incidentally... I’m a bit of a wallflower myself and could really relate to Charlie, the main character, adolescent writer of letters, and discrete DJ animator of soirées. That was me then, always on the sidelines, never eager to show off or get too much attention, and somewhat socially awkward.

Quanto è difficile trovare qualcuno che sappia ascoltare?Personalmente è una domanda che mi sono posta più volte nella mia vita. Io ho sempre cercato di farlo e credo che a volte qualcuno abbia approfittato di questa mia inclinazione.Trovare, però, qualcuno disposto ad ascoltarmi non è stato facile.Charlie, protagonista di questo romanzo epistolare, non si è mai fatto questa domanda perché lui è uno che ascolta senza chiedere di essere ascoltato. E’ un quindicenne particolare dato la sua vita si svolge principalmente nella sua testa. Osserva, pensa, riflette.Questo atteggiamento lo rende “strano” agli occhi degli altri.E’ il primo anno delle superiori e Charlie sente l’impellente bisogno degli altri. Con movimenti un po’ impacciati ma efficaci farà la conoscenza di Patrick e sua sorella Sam...Un romanzo di formazione che dovrebbe essere letto al di là della fama del best seller e, soprattutto, al di là, del pregiudizio verso la narrativa classificata come young adult.Tra libri, canzoni, poesie, film* ed il rituale del Rocky Horror Picture Show, Charlie si libera da un passato doloroso e compie il suo atto di crescita.Mi è piaciuto molto.* Wilkipedia riporta tutto l’elenco:https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragazzo...Una volta, su un pezzo di carta gialla con le righe verdi,scrisse una poesia,e la intitolò «Chops»,perché quello era il nome del suo cane.E i versi parlavano di lui.Il professore gli diede una Ae una stella dorata;e sua madre la appese alla porta della cucinae la lesse a tutte le sue zie.Era l’anno in cui Padre Tracyportò tutti i ragazzi allo zoo,e li lasciò cantare sull’autobus;l’anno in cui nacque la sua sorellina,con quelle unghiette minuscole, senza capelli.Sua madre e suo padre si baciavano sempre,e la ragazza che abitava dietro l’angolo gli mandòun biglietto di San Valentino con una fila di X,e lui dovette chiedere a suo padre che cosa significassero.E suo padre, la sera, gli rimboccava sempre le coperte.Era sempre pronto a farlo.Una volta, su un pezzo di carta bianca con le righe blu,scrisse una poesia,e la intitolò «Autunno»,perché quella era la stagione che stava vivendo,e i versi parlavano di questo.Il professore gli diede una Ae gli chiese di scrivere in modo più chiaro;sua madre non la appese alla porta della cucina,perché aveva appena imbiancato.E i ragazzi gli disseroche Padre Tracy fumava sigari,e lasciava i mozziconi sui banchi,e a volte questi facevano dei buchi.Era l’anno in cui sua sorella mise gli occhialicon le lenti spesse, e la montatura nera;e la ragazza che abitava dietro l’angolo rise,quando le chiese di andare a vedere Babbo Natale.E i ragazzi gli spiegarono perchéi suoi genitori continuavano a baciarsi:suo padre non gli rimboccava mai le coperte,e s’infuriavase glielo chiedeva piangendo.Una volta, su un pezzo di carta strappato dal suo taccuino,scrisse una poesia,e la intitolò «Innocenza: una domanda»,perché quello era il quesito che si poneva su di lei,e i versi parlavano di questo.Il suo professore gli diede una A,e gli lanciò uno sguardo strano, serio;e sua madre non la appese alla porta della cucina,perché non gliela fece mai leggere.Era l’anno in cui Padre Tracy morì,e lui dimenticò come finivail «Credo degli Apostoli».Sorprese sua sorella a fare sessoin veranda, sul retro;e sua madre e suo padre non si baciavano mai,e non si parlavano.E la ragazza che abitava dietro l’angolosi truccava troppo,e lui tossiva quando la baciava,ma la baciava lo stesso,perché era la cosa giusta da fare.Alle tre del mattino si infilava nel letto,e suo padre russava rumorosamente.Ecco perché, sul retro di un sacchetto di carta marrone,provò a scrivere un’altra poesia,e la intitolò «Il nulla assoluto»,perché i versi, in realtà, parlavano di questo.E si diede una A,e si tagliò i suoi dannatissimi polsi.E la appese alla porta del bagno,perché questa volta, pensò, non sarebbe riuscitoa raggiungere la cucina.

Charlie che con i suoi silenzi, i suoi sguardi e le sue poche parole riesce comunque a lasciare un segno nella vita delle persone che lo circondano e che si accorgono solo a tratti, quasi con stupore, che dentro quel ragazzino taciturno e introverso c'è un mondo intero che si agita.Charlie che nel momento in cui si racconta e si accorge di vivere momenti irripetibili, comprende che tutti i libri che hai letto sono già stati letti da altre persone. E tutte le canzoni che hai amato sono state ascoltate da altre persone. E la ragazza che tu trovi carina è carina anche per altre persone. E ti rendi conto che, se considerassi queste cose quando sei felice, ti sentiresti alla grande, perchè quella che stai descrivendo è 'l'armonia'.Charlie che si trascina sulle spalle, come una lumaca il suo guscio, un trauma infantile che nemmeno ricorda più di aver subito.Chissà, mi chiedo, se anche io sono stata una ragazza da parete.Forse no, non completamente, anche se ci sono stati momenti nella mia adolescenza in cui ho creduto di essere trasparente, o altri in cui, forse, ho desiderato esserlo, altri in cui, avrei voluto, come Charlie, che il mondo smettessi di girare per poter scendere, o addormentarmi e risvegliarmi solo mille anni dopo.Momenti, in cui tutti noi ci limitiamo e «accettiamo l'amore che pensiamo di meritare», quando invece abbiamo la vita davanti a noi, momenti in cui, nel mondo, tutto sembra avere importanza tranne te.Ma noi, come dice Charlie nel tunnel, noi siamo infinito, dobbiamo solo accorgercene e lasciarci trasportare dal vento, così come questo piccolo romanzo, che dovrebbe essere letto da adulti, quando si è in vena di ricordi e di bilanci, ci vuole raccontare e ricordare. Qui , «Un inverno», la cassetta che Charlie regala a Patrick per Natale.«Non so se ti sei mai sentito così. Non so se hai mai desiderato addormentarti, per svegliarti solo mille anni dopo. Non so se hai mai pensato che vorresti non essere al mondo; o renderti conto di non essere vivo. O qualcosa del genere.Credo che sia un'idea morbosa, ma è esattamente così che succede a me, in questi momenti. Ecco perchè sto cercando di non pensare. Voglio solo che ogni cosa smetta di girare»""Show more"

(i feel the need to clarify that my father did, indeed, get tested for corona. he tested negative. this was just a really bad cold, or maybe the flu.) sister placed second to last in the second best division. we were slightly proud.i came home again, then left for my performance with this book in my bag. i stopped at starbucks for the pumpkin chai latte first and i had a conversation with the nice barista who always gets excited when i come through the drive thru because i sit for an extra five minutes and listen to him talk about his day, and i occasionally input anecdotes from my retail job to make him feel better. i drove off to school, sat in the parking lot, and read more of this book. i left it in the passenger seat as the time for rehearsal finally started and i went off to prepare.after the performance, i was driving one of my best friends to meet up with a bigger group for dinner. he saw this book sitting in the passenger seat and asked, ""do you like this one?""i responded, ""i don't know. it's hitting a little too hard right now.""on the way to dinner, we listened to the backstreet boys and accidentally got into a drag race. once i got home at around eleven, i sat down on my couch and read another 50 pages of this book before i finally fell asleep.i didn't touch this book for a week after that. i was finally feeling a little better about my life, but i couldn't get charlie and sam and patrick and brad out of my head. finally, at 1:30 this morning, i found myself able to finish it.i am proud to say that this is the second book of all time that has genuinely made me cry. i finished this book, closed it, stared at the cover a little, then laid down in bed and cried for ten minutes. it's been twelve hours and i'm still not over it, and quite honestly i don't know if i ever will be. this is an instant new favorite. i am absolutely in love. and sorry for including a whole cooking blog life story before telling you that i cried like a baby, but i hope it helped you to understand just how much it means to me.Show more"

My issues with it remain the same.  I DNF this book at 45%  It is rare that I put down a book because I hate not finishing something I started. In my opinion, unfinished tasks are some of the most anxiety-provoking fiends of existence. But I also understand it is healthy to give myself permission to stop reading things I do not like. I could not get into this book for the life of me, and based on other reviews I have read, this book ends with the same monotonous tone it begins with. Despite all the hype surrounding this book, I went into it with few expectations. I didn't even read the premise because if this book was adored by so many, it had to be pretty good, right? I watched the movie trailer ages ago (mainly because Emma Watson was in it), and by the looks of it, this book was supposed to be a heartwarming, poetic, and beautiful young adult novel like More Happy Than Not, The Fault in Our Stars, or A List of Cages. Critiquing a book is wholly subjective in my opinion. That is one thing I love about literature. It is not like math, where there is always just one answer; a book can have multiple answers. When I put this book down, I was trying to grapple with the reasons why I could not finish it. In essence, I thought the concept of this book was good and well intended, but perhaps, the execution was not the best. I appreciated that Chbosky tried to encapsulate important teen issues in this book: social isolation, sexual assault, abusive relationships, and childhood trauma to name a few. Also, I understand and appreciate if this book resonated with anybody, or if it helped them through a difficult time. My view on it in no way seeks to undermine the plethora of lives this story might have impacted. Maybe my age is the issue? I am 21-years-old, and maybe if I read this book when I was in middle school, it would have impacted me more. *But* I feel like truly good books are timeless. I recently read Wonder and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and both of them filled me with that inner ethereal glow you get after finishing a great book. I just think... this book was too... simple and I guess surface-level for me. The writing style was so basic and I feel bad for even typing that (my inner INFJ is coming out). This book was festooned with sentences like: ""My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle."" Although reading books is entertaining, the main reason I read is to think, understand, and learn about the world around me. I want to be a part of stories that change me, and this book sadly did not. I also felt like both the narrator and secondary character lacked development. You know that moment when you read a book and the characters just come to life? That never happened for me when I read this book. Maybe I will come back to this book in the future. I plan to eventually finish all the books on my DNF shelf one day. This book was not the right one for me, but perhaps it will be for you.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36078220-4robin,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"July 2, 2016",14 likes,0,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower staat bekend als een nineties versie van The Catcher in the Rye. Het verband met J.D. Salingers klassieker uit 1951 is snel gelegd. Net als in The Catcher in the Rye heeft The Perks een ongelukkige tiener als hoofdpersoon, die anders is dan zijn leeftijdsgenoten, verslag doet van zijn belevenissen en de lezer deelgenoot maakt van zijn gedachten. Zoals gezegd, Charlie is anders. Hij is hoogbegaafd, verlegen en gevoelig. Vrienden heeft Charlie niet: hij staat aan de zijlijn. Een typische muurbloem. Zijn leraar Engels, die hem boeken geeft, stimuleert hem om meer te participeren in plaats van alleen te observeren, een advies dat Charlie ter harte neemt. Hij raakt bevriend met Sam, op wie hij verliefd wordt, en met Patrick, haar homoseksuele stiefbroer. Die als bijnaam ""nothing"" kreeg. '""Nothing got his name when kids used to tease him in middle school. The kids started calling him Patty when his real name is Patrick. And ""nothing"" told these kids, ""Listen, you either call me Patrick, or you call me nothing"". So, the kids started calling him ""Nothing""'. Op humoristische, maar ook pijnlijke, wijze laat Chbosky zien hoe wreed het er in de arena van het schoolleven aan toe kan gaan. De drie worden vrienden. Sam en Patrick nemen Charlie op sleeptouw en laten hem kennismaken met de wereld van seks, drugs en The Rocky Horror Picture Show (huh?).Het verhaal heeft ook een donker randje. Al in het begin van het boek wordt duidelijk dat Charlie door de zelfmoord van zijn beste vriend een moeilijke tijd achter de rug heeft. Maar waarom is Charlie zo anders? Pas het laatste deel van het boek plaatst alles in een ander daglicht.Chbosky heeft voor ogen gehad om een hedendaagse 'Catcher in the Rye' te willen schrijven. Aan die gedachte heb ik me tijdens het lezen van The Perks geen moment kunnen onttrekken. Door Salingers boek zelfs te benoemen als één van de boeken die Charlie krijgt van zijn leraar Engels legt Chbosky het er wel erg dik bovenop. Het lijkt alsof Chbosky met Charlie een aaibare en innemende versie van Holden Caulfield, hoofdpersoon van The Catcher in the Rye, heeft willen neerzetten. Caulfield-light. Juist dat zorgde ervoor dat Charlie mijn aandacht niet op een zelfde manier wist vast te houden als de onuitstaanbare Holden Caulfield dat deed. Ook niet zo sterk vond ik dat alle denkbare (tiener)problemen - zelfmoord, verkrachting, zelfverminking, drugsgebruik, incest, geweld in relaties, etc - in ruim 200 pagina's voorbijkomen zonder dat Chbosky dat echt uitdiept.Maakt dat The Perks tot een slecht boek? Nee, zeker niet. Het boek leest prettig door. Ook slim is de verpakking van het verhaal in aan de lezer gerichte brieven, waardoor die bij het verhaal wordt betrokken. En het einde van het verhaal tilt het boek naar een hoger niveau. Ook biedt het boek een mooi tijdsbeeld van het leven van een tiener in de jaren negentig. Maar het verhaal komt me net iets te bedacht over om me echt te kunnen verplaatsen in het leven van een verwarde tiener.Show more"

“So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.”
Trigger Warning: This book deals with some really heavy themes so please be careful. (Drugs, sex, rape, suicide, Abuse etc.)I gave this book 5 stars and I don’t really know how to explain why I loved it so much but, I’ll try to explain my view point as much as possible in this review.The book wasn’t slow at all for me. I felt intrigued and couldn’t put the book down! (except after I realized that it was pretty late, and that I had a ton of stuff to do in the morning..oops). The writing style was simple and fun. I felt like he was confiding in me. Like all his letters were written specifically for me to read.When I read this and watched the movie it took me some time to piece everything together. Now that I’m a lot older, everything seems to make sense. At first I thought he was just a really weird kid, you know? Later It was that Charlie did seem like a very sensitive boy, and not in a bad way. Never in a bad way. I could tell by his personality. He was very empathetic. Cared about others a lot and at times cared for them more than himself. He was also very understanding and always wanted to help the best way he could.
“We accept the love we think we deserve.”
That was one of the reasons why I loved him so much.Reading this book really interested me because it was very different from the way I grew up in my society. I never was exposed to any of the themes dealt in the book but I felt that it was very important to understand what others might have gone through.Reading this a few years back was pointless in a way. The way I thought back then is definitely not the way I think now. Since I’m majoring in psychology somehow, everything hit me a little harder, and everything meant a lot more to me somehow.The themes in this were quite heavy so, if you feel like you can’t handle it just yet, that’s okay. It was hard for me a couple of years back but I felt like now was a better time to reread this. 
“So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.”
I still don’t know how to explain to you guys how much I loved this! And I don’t think my review so far explained everything. But honestly this book really did change my view and opened my eyes to so many things.|| Blog || Instagram ||Show more"

The book consists of numerous archived letters written by a person named Charlie, he writes to the unknown participant of the letters about his journey throughout high school. He ends up joining a friend group that is accepting of his unique personality and he also starts falling in love with one of the ladies in the friend group.  I found it interesting how this book was written through fictional letters just like the original Dracula novel. You never learn who is receiving these letters, but you do learn a little bit about them in the end. The friend group that Charlie joins mainly is comprised of older high school kids. Charlie is also very emotional and ends up crying a lot.  I found the narrative of this novel to be pretty compelling. I enjoyed hearing about the things that Charlie likes, which made me more connected to him as a character. Charlie feels very young though, although maybe it’s just the way he writes. Also, some of the characters are not very likable, and sometimes Charlie is not a very good character either. Charlie ends up doing a lot of stupid things in this book. I found myself questioning out loud why Charlie would even think of doing these things.  I was not expecting the ending of this book. It was frustrating and very much so a shock. There is also an epilogue to this book. At first, I was worried that this epilogue might ruin the book for me, but it ended up being more wholesome which is exactly what I needed after the overwhelming nature of this book. I am very conflicted about how I feel about this book. On one hand, I felt that this book provided a nice narrative and interesting characters progressing through hard times, but on the other hand, I feel that this book takes a lot of the issues that it talks about with not much thought. I enjoyed this book, but I would’ve liked it more if they dealt with the harder topics better.Overall, this book was very disappointing, especially if I compare this book, to other books I've read that deal with similar subject matter. I can respect this book for its classic status and its big influence, but I feel that books like Bright Lights Dark Nights, Happyface, and Dear Evan Hansen, do what this book is trying to accomplish, but better. I can see why this book would be impactful to some people though. Show more"

Adolescenziali, lo ripeto, lo ribadisco, perché sia chiaro a tutti che ci si trova davanti ad un romanzo un po' di genere, un bildungsroman fortemente americano, stretto in uno spazio-tempo codificato (l'anno scolastico, la famiglia, la scuola, e poco altro). Eppure, è un romanzo capace di parlare a tutti.L'autore, al suo primo romanzo, può vantare una notevole abilità di scrittura, che pur toccando temi molto forti, spesso abusati, riesce a mantenere fino alla fine una scrittura semplice, spontanea, leggerissima, in linea con il carattere del protagonista. Charlie ha quindici, sedici anni, racconta la sua vita e la sua esperienza del primo anno delle superiori ad un destinatario senza volto e senza nome, e sorprende il linguaggio semplice e un po' ingenuo col quale descrive ogni cosa, tutte le prime volte (la prima cotta, la prima sigaretta, la prima canna, la prima sbronza). Non fatevi ingannare così facilmente, perché Charlie non è un ragazzo normale, il suo carattere si è forgiato sul dolore, sul senso di colpa, su macchie indelebili che soltanto alla fine vengono a galla. E straordinaria è la sua caratterizzazione, davvero un bel personaggio a tutto tondo.Con altrettanto abilità l'autore riesce a muoversi in territori che hanno visto milioni di scrittori avventuarvisi: anche quando parla delle cose più scontate, anche quando mette in scena personaggi che possono sembrare i più stereotipati (la figa della scuola, il figo della scuola, il professore alternativo, il quarterback segretamente gay), dalla scrittura di Chbosky traspare sempre qualcosa di più. Ci sono temi forti e controversi, e stupisce la naturalezza e l'ingenuità con cui il giovane e innocente Charlie si avventura nel mondo della droga, nell'omosessualità sofferta del migliore amico Patrick, nel sesso senza limiti, senza misteri e senza segreti; lungi dallo stupire e sconvolgere, Chbosky arriva dritto al punto e riesce a parlare a tutti. Credere in se stessi, nelle proprie convinzioni, rimanere se stessi anche nelle circostanze più sfavorevoli, e l'amicizia, e l'amore, sono tutti temi fondamentali, ai quali viene dato il giusto peso.Insomma, sarà pur sempre un romanzo adolescenziale, con limiti inevitabilmente ben precisi, ma è capace di lasciare veramente qualcosa.Show more"

And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn’t really change the fact that you have what you have.

This book makes me happy and sad at the same time. Charlie is in the freshman year at school and he writes letters to his imaginary friend about his life. And even if he’s an average kid, he’s going through a lot. I read recently a lot of books with complicated stories and it was so nice to read something so simple. No fake dramas, no extreme or made-up storylines. Just daily things and thoughs. And that’s the magic of this book. 

You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.

Sometimes there were passages with deep thoughs which makes you think more about how you live your life, but even if you don’t want to find the biggest purpose of those passages, it’s okay. You still can enjoy the story. I liked that the author gave a reader the choice if he/she want to read a simple story or to have a think about his/her life. Books written as a diary are my favorite. It makes me feel more connected with the characters and story; everything seems to be more real. And I loved it.I highly recommend this book to all. It can be life-changing. Show more"

Maybe next year - if I remember?Now every teenager probably thinks their life is freaking hard. I definitely did sometimes but that's because I did what every normal teenager (or kid) did - we complained a LOT. My parents never sugarcoated anything to me or my siblings (and I'm the youngest) so of course they put us in our place whenever we complained. I knew my life didn't suck as much as I thought - trust me, I did and I still do.In The Perks of Being a Wallflower we meet Charlie. Now Charlie is an introvert and lost his only real friend who committed suicide. For Charlie life is hard because he lost his person in a way. I felt so bad for him because I have no idea how I would deal with knowing one of my best friends did that. Other than that, I really liked Charlie's character. He was mystery to me and I just wanted to figure him out so early on. Other than liking Charlie, I really liked Sam and Patrick. Another thing I liked about this book was that it didn't stay on one topic for the entire book. No, it changed because their lives changed. I like how Chbosky wrote this book. It was a really easy and quick read - I just wish I didn't have to put it down all the freaking time due to work or life.This book makes me want to watch the movie again and again.

One of my favorite books and my all time favorite movie as well. We sat around the TV, munching on cold refrigerated pizza, and just basked in the glory of this story. One which I resonate with more than perhaps any other fictional tale I ever come across. When the end credits rolled around, David Bowie’s iconic song “Heroes” was playing, and one of my friends walked away to go pee or something. My best friend looked me dead in the eyes, nodded, and just gave me a hug. It’s like he finally understood slightly more what I’ve experienced with my depression, suicidal attempts in the past, and just being a loner. And then he asked me a question, “wanna go for a drive?”Obviously, I did. And the three of us journeyed into my homie’s blue truck and drove into the night. And oh my god — that night is one of the most memorable of my entire existence. I did feel infinite.If it wasn’t for a groundbreaking novel like this, that night might not have been so wonderful, bonding, and just plain badass. It’s a night I don’t speak of often, my best friend and I do occasionally, yet it just put me into the full shoes of a character like Charlie. And the music was playing loud, I felt content, and I was with people I love. And that was enough. It still is enough.>>> 5 Stars ⭐️✨🌟✨⭐️Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38021482-monika,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"September 7, 2019",14 likes,0,"Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a journey that I was anxious to undertake, but once I am done with it, I don't feel the need to regret about it. Written in an epistolary format by a young boy called Charlie, the novel, in less than 300 pages, tries to deal with various topics such as child abuse, homosexuality, low self-esteem, pregnancy and abortion, among others. The book, even though it is heavy with very strong and intense subjects that it deals with, is very short in comparison. Hence, Chbosky, I feel, had committed the mistake of making it as simple as a day-to-day narration of events. It, in turn, took away the beauty of a wonderful literature this book could have been. I don't regret undertaking this journey because the last chapter, kind of, made it up for me. Perhaps it is the emotions that it hit upon, or maybe it is the beauty of words. I never thought I am going to like it until I did in the last chapter. That, however, can't make up for the fact that this novel lacks all emotions that I, as a reader, was looking for. I haven't yet watched the movie adaptation of this book, but I feel that it would be one of those books whose adaptation I'm going to going to like much more than the written one. Show more"

In a way that's what we do when writing a diary. It is often easier to talk about this stuff to someone who doesn't know you. The end surprised me although I have the feeling that it doesn't offer enough of an explanation for everything that has happened for example why Charlie's social and emotional development seems to be lagging behind so much on his cognitive development. I quite enjoyed it and it is definitely worth 3.5 but I'm not sure about rounding it up.

Where to start with the character that every teen can relate to? He's not a character teens should look up to, respect, or idolize, because he makes the mistakes that every teen does. He is just proof that someone else really is going through the same thing. He really becomes more of a friend then anything. This book is written as a journal, but Charlie writes like he's talking to a real person. It's definitely a different way of writing, and it really works for this book. Charlie really is a wallflower. He looks at his life like he's watching through a window that he can't get on the other side of. Charlie experiences all of the things that normal teens are exposed to, and he handles each in a different way. Read THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, because Charlie makes you realize that everyone is going though the same types of ordeals. Love him, hate him, root for him, and cherish him.

The exploration of adolescence in the sex, drugs, drinking, and searching for one's self pulls at your heart strings while managing to stand out in the coming-of-age genre. While I did find a lot of relevance in the story, what held me back from enjoying it more, and the thing that I just couldn't get past, was how incredibly sad it was.The weird part is while I found this book to be so depressing, I felt a huge disconnect from the main character. As one terrible event after another happened to Charlie, I would turn the page and think, ""wow, that's so sad,"" but I couldn't actually empathize with him. Charlie was a very one-dimensional character who often expressed himself in choppy, short sentences that left me emotionally detached.It seemed like Chbosky was trying to stockpile as many tragedies into one short book as possible. There was rape, molestation, abortion, incest, homosexuality, etc. A mountain of heavy topics were crammed into a few short chapters that could have each used a book of their own. The plot went something like: Charlie would mention he saw a girl getting raped, feel sad about it, and move on. Repeat this method throughout the rest of the book and you're left with a disturbing desensitized numbness to some serious topics.Perks is written by Charlie in a letter format addressed to ""Dear Friend."" With stiff sentences awkwardly grouped together and an incredibly young narrative voice that reminded me of one of my tween diary entries, Charlie leads us on an emotional journey of his brand new start to high school. I liked that Charlie was unique in a sea of young adult protagonists; he was very observant and focused on other people rather than himself. But although his wallflower status was unusual, his childish and overly emotional behavior threw me off, especially since his two best friends were eighteen and Charlie sounded like an immature nine year old.When a book revolves around the characters, I had better be able to like them. What really frustrated me was Charlie, Sam, and Patrick's overly angsty behavior that made me unable to care about them. Charlie was constantly bawling his eyes out and there were an infinite number of vaguely poetic quotes just dying to be uploaded to Tumblr, but the actual development was poor.“So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I’m still trying to figure out how that could be.”I feel like Perks could be an important book for those experiencing adolescence, but my teen years were very different from Charlie's, which is maybe why I had such a hard time relating with him. One thing I did like was how Charlie stood for something I think most people can understand: feeling out of place, alone, and unloved. It's hard fitting in when you're the new kid and that's something I was able to sympathize with Charlie about. I also loved the 1990s theme and Charlie's cute mix tapes.While I could appreciate certain scenes, this quick read ultimately left me underwhelmed and I never felt that special connection most readers seemed to experience with Perks.Show more"

When there is a hype going on you can sit back, chillax, and enjoy your laziness until everything settles down and life goes back to normal because you're not missing anything, really.I've seen the movie first when it came out in 2012. Once it hit the credits I decided that I must read the book. I'm a procrastinator so it took me over 2 years to process that decision. Anyway, as I told you, the movie left me in a burning urge to read between the lines and see how everything developed in a retrospective manner.
Wallflower:
Let's handle the title first, shall we? The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I wasn't sure what's really meant by ""wallflower"". The first thing that came to my mind was a wallpaper with a flowery print on it, and that the protagonist is supposed to be a ""wallflower"", which means he's insignificant and unnoticed in the whole picture when you cast a quick glance at that wallpaper. But still, a ""wallflower"" is pretty in its own and it's a part of that wallpaper. A ""wallflower"" was like an individual and the wallpaper was like a community, that's how I understood it. Excuse my analytic blabbering. I was so close to the real meaning. After a quick research via the mighty internet, the conclusion was: a ""wallflower"" means the misfit, shy, introvert, awkward, loner type of a person.
Why I didn't necessarily like it:
The trauma was TOO condensed like the author overstuffed his book with every social affair on the menu. Rape, insect, teen sexuality, homosexuality, abuse, molestation, abortion, sexism, bullying, fighting, partying, alcohol, drugs, death, suicide, mental issues, and more. I know these issues are somehow connected but I didn't have enough room to process different emotions and relate to the main character because the author is like shoving each issue down your throat. The narration didn't stir my feelings at all. All I felt was indifference. I get that societies have those serious issues, but handling them all together in a 200-page-ish book was too much for my taste. Stephen Chbosky was trying too hard in my opinion. Also, the writing style was an obvious rip-off of J.D. Salinger's in The Catcher in the Rye which left an unoriginal taste in my mouth. Another thing is the protagonist, Charlie. He's a 15-year-old who writes a series of letters, diary-style, to an anonymous friend. You'll think he's only 6 years old and that he just learned how to compose simplified flat sentences. Normally I wouldn't mock one's way of speaking in its own. What bothered me is that he's supposed to be extremely smart (straight-A student) who is also a dedicated bookworm, hence you should expect deeper expressions and a relatively decent eloquence from a 15-going-on-16 boy. Alas, you're likely gonna be disappointed on how childish and shallow his storytelling seemed. And then there are these vague hints on autism but you'll never know if that's the case for sure. Charlie didn't seem a RainMan to me because the uncertainty was dominating. It saddens me to wrap up 2014 and kick off the new year with such an awful book, but as a compensation I'm glad for not joining the general crowd that makes of this book such a big deal. 
Judge this book by its cover:
You know the saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover""? Well, aside from its metaphor, this one comfortably wins the-ugliest-book-cover-ever contest and doesn't suggest any goodness whatsoever to what's inside. Just looking at the cover gives my eyes a burning sensation of disgust. A green shade between dull lime and neon vomit isn't very appetizing. A very amateur bad job by the artist person whoever made it.I would've given it 1.5 stars because I read worse books and I really wanted to like this one but unfortunately I couldn't. Plus, how fabulous this quote is?P.s.. I'm not being sarcastic regarding that quote, I swear. Check out my favorite quotes if you don't believe me.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18879487-joaquin-garza,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"September 19, 2014",13 likes,0,"La literatura juvenil actual (llámese ‘young adult’) cae grosso modo en alguna de las siguientes tres categorías: 1) La distopía descafeinada (Collins, Roth, Dashner, Lowry) 2) El romance paranormal para señoritas de doce años (Meyer, Clare, García) y 3) La novela juvenil ‘naturalista’ o de problemas sociales (Chbosky, Rowell, Green). 	Dentro de este último caso, la fama del libro de Chbosky, si bien considerable, se ha visto ligeramente eclipsada por el furor (un furor que me pasma, he de decir) hacia las novelas de Green. De cualquier modo, fue lo suficientemente conocida como para motivar una adaptación fílmica estelarizando a Doña Hermione Granger y a Don Percy Jackson. 	Positivamente la novela tiene una serie de virtudes que apenas vencen a los deméritos. Y creo que su gran virtud es llegar a ser evocadora a un nivel verdaderamente 'atmosférico'. Es decir, de evocar perfectamente una cualidad estética o emocional. Chbosky maneja también con cierta maestría sus ‘catchphrases’ y de, pese a que a veces la inmadurez del personaje principal cansa, uno puede identificarse más o menos con sus cuitas. Por mucho lo mejor del libro es la escena final del túnel: da un colofón adecuado y sumamente poderoso. Su diseño de producción como libro es impecable también.	Por otro lado, creo que el principal problema de ‘Las ventajas de ser un marginado’ es que, como novela naturalista, no sabe mucho a dónde ir. ¿Por qué escribió Chbosky esta obra? 1) ¿Es para ‘advertir’ a los jóvenes de los problemas con los que se pueden cruzar? 2) ¿Es para ‘denunciar’ como tantos la resaca provocada por la década de los ochentas? 3) ¿Es para ser objetivamente ‘provocador’? Haya sido la que haya sido su intención, primero ésta no se adivina y luego, de ser cualquiera de las tres sale perdiendo. Porque me parece poco probable que una persona que se entiende de una sólida clase media estadounidense se encuentre de frente con todo este cuadro de tragedias una tras otra. El abuso es una, pero súmenle alcohol, drogas, embarazos no deseados, problemas psiquiátricos, violencia familiar y doméstica y homosexualidad, y ya parece que es o Remi o una película de Pedro Infante. O una más: que esto ocurra desligado de consideraciones de raza y clase en el país del norte. No es estadísticamente representativo, lo cual fuerza demasiado la credibilidad de la novela. Por lo menos un Zola espaciaba sus exploraciones sobre la naturalidad del drama social a través de diversas generaciones de la misma familia. Otra es que, para añadir al debate sobre la formación cultural de la generación del ‘grunge’ Chbosky ni da nuevas ideas ni propone un enfoque interesante.	Mi última objeción es de carácter de gusto personal. Buena parte de mi conflicto con la literatura juvenil actual (esto es, de los últimos cinco años) es porque prefiero que los libros enfocados a la juventud sean formativos de manera más bien alegre y heroica. Y si se abandona este ideal, por lo menos que la sensación de vacío que quede sea abordada de una manera magistral, cercana a la altura del arte. Es decir, si quieren escuchar a un adolescente con problemas, vayan con Holden Caulfield. Él tiene mucho más que decirles.Show more"

 the most difficult review to write is about the books you admire, books that make you think, books you adore, books which define you 
 and as I write this review I know I won't do it any justice.So let me put this straight :  There is nothing special about this book yet this is what makes it more brilliant.Anyone looking for a great story : Nah ah simple storyMaybe it has complex characters who have complicated lives and yes it will be exciting we will SOLVE them or try to learn what's WRONG with them : Nopes.

And I think it's bad when the most honest way a boy can look at a girl is through a camera.”  “People who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they don't, nothing will work out the way they want.” “Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.” “And I guess I realized at that moment that I really did love her. Because there was nothing to gain, and that didn't matter.”  “I love my mom so much. I don't care if that's corny to say. I think on my next birthday, I'm going to buy her a present. I think that should be a tradition. The kid gets gifts from everybody, and he buys one present for his mom since she was there, too. ”  “It's great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms or something like that? You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't.

This story was different from anything I’ve read. It consists of letters written by Charlie, an observant fifteen year-old, to an unknown recipient -- the reader. It’s basically a diary of a precocious teenage boy and I loved his insight into the world of school, family, dating, and sex. At first I thought Charlie had Asperger’s or Autism due to his unique, naïve voice as well as his emotional freak-outs, but then I understood his mental health issues more clearly once he reveals his secret at the end. I was stunned by the revelation which has stayed with me for a week after finishing the novel.The story takes place in the early 1990’s and reminded me of some fond memories from that time, including the morose songs by the Smiths which could put you in a suicidal mood. Charlie talks about his sister’s boyfriend making her a good old mix tape:He is always making mix tapes for my sister with very specific themes. One was called ""Autumn Leaves"". He included many songs by the Smiths. (p. 10)Charlie made me laugh often, like when he discusses his brother’s football teammates:They finally got around to talking about SAT scores.And this guy said, ""I got a 710"".And my brother said, ""Math or verbal?""And the guy said, ""Huh?""And the whole team laughed. (p. 52)The following quote was so endearing to me. I loved Charlie even more after I read this:My grandma is very old, and she doesn't remember things a lot, but she bakes the most delicious cookies. When I was very little, we had my mom's mom, who always had candy, and my dad's mom, who always had cookies. My mom told me that when I was little, I called them ""Candy Grandma"" and ""Cookies Grandma"". (p. 85)Isn’t that adorable? I can totally picture a little boy bouncing on his car seat in anticipation of visiting Cookies Grandma.I loved what his young English teacher tells him about the importance of participating in life. I could see much development in Charlie as he takes the risk to participate, morphing from a wallflower to a valued friend, brother, and son. I think his burgeoning personal strength allows him to face the secret from his past and finally begin to heal. Charlie’s genuineness and vulnerability were quite touching.

The letters Charlie writes to an alias serve as the basis for the book's narrative. We learn about Charlie's social awkwardness, mental health problems, and quest for empathy through these letters. The book touches on a wide range of topics, including growing up, friendship, love, mental health, sexual orientation, and identity.The author's skill at capturing the unfiltered feelings and tribulations of adolescence is one of the book's merits. Since Charlie speaks with honesty, sincerity, and relatability, it is simple to identify with him and his narrative. The book also offers a frank look at growing up difficulties and adolescent issues.Overall, I thought this book was a moving and strong read. It's an interesting, relevant, and honest coming-of-age tale. Growing up is never simple, and we all experience hardships. The Perks of Being a Wallflower serves as a timely reminder of this. Anyone who has ever tried to find their place in the world or felt like an outsider should read the book. To everyone looking for a stimulating read with strong emotional resonance, I wholeheartedly suggest it.

Frankly, I didn't know it even was a book until I saw the movie a second time (I live in Sweden, cut me some slack here).

It was a not very steep roller-coaster. It went from five stars to four stars to three stars to five again and so on.

But Stina, you might say, why didn't you settle on 4 stars? Well, the answer is simple; the book didn't leave me as in awe as the movie. I know, catastrophe! After seeing the movie for the first time, I had to lie down for a while and just let my mind wander. Upon finishing the book? I turned off the light and fell asleep. BUT IT WASN'T BAD.

I hope you enjoy it. Honest.The Perks of Being a Wallflower was stunning, sincere, and incredibly heartbreaking as much as it was heartwarming.I loved and completely cherished every single page, sentence and word in this book. I believed that Charlie represented every one of us, and for that, we will always relate to him. Charlie's voice in my head was very memorable and kind, and he really was the kind of person whom you would need to talk to and tell him what you were going through; you would also want to be with him just because he understood people in a very deep way. With being a simple character, Charlie was very complex, and I guess that was what made him unique and and beloved in every way possible.In addition to Charlie, Sam and Patrick were two of my favorite characters. Chbosky painted them with understanding and wisdom beyond their age, along with affection. By being like that, they made the book even more interesting than it was. Their friendship with Charlie was one of the most enjoyable and sincere parts in this book.

The first-person point of view offers an insight into Charlie's emotions as he experiences all these new situations (these situations boil down to friendships and girl problems, though), but I feel like we might have gotten a better (and less annoying) report had it been an omniscient narrator. Charlie kept crying and I might sounds cruel for saying it, but it did start to get on my nerves. I understand he doesn't fit in and the controversy about him being autistic also hasn't escaped me, but I'm not going to get into that discussion, as I know nothing on the subject. The final plot twist/revelation didn't come as a surprise because I'd seen the movie prior to reading the book. I can't help but feel that this plot twist wasn't handled in the best way because there were little to no hints to it through-out the book and it just fell flat.I really liked the literary references and the bits when he talked about the books he was assigned.

It's just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.""""Is that bad?""""Yes.""siamo tutti uguali ma allo stesso tempo diversi. bene o male facciamo le stesse esperienze e questo libro secondo me è un ottimo modo per sentirci capiti e meno soli durante un periodo adolescenziale (ma non solo). specialmente perché charlie avendo amici più grandi si è ritrovato a sperimentare cose a cui non era pronto e questa potrebbe essere una cosa che, a volte, molti di noi fanno solo per aderire a una persona che non sono e quindi cosi non rimanere da soli e essere accettati da qualcuno che non li conosce veramente.il libro è strutturato in lettere, il che è molto originale e diverso dal solito (in modo positivo). alla fine c’è stato un colpo di scena, un po’ sottinteso, ma che comunque mi ha lasciato a bocca aperta.il libro parla di molti problemi, che tutti possono avere, da i più piccoli ai più grandi e a volte noi non lo capiamo nemmeno, perché non ci fermiamo a guardarli per davvero e quindi non sapremo mai cosa in realtà stanno passando. mi è piaciuto molto anche il modo dello scrittore di descrivere i problemi che il protagonista ha e il modo in cui li vive e affronta.secondo me tutto dovrebbero leggerlo almeno una volta, con una certa sensibilità, prima di aver controllato i tw (poiché magari alcune cose potrebbero dare fastidio al lettore).se volete iniziare a leggere in inglese o se avete già letto in inglese vi consiglio di prenderlo in lingua originale perché è molto semplice. «I finished The Fountainhead. It was a really great experience. It's strange to describe reading a book as a really great experience, but that's kind of how it felt. It was a different book from the others because it wasn't about being a kid. And it wasn't like The Stranger or Naked Lunch even though I think it was philosophical in a way. But it wasn't like you had to really search for the philosophy. It was pretty straightforward, I thought, and the great part is that I took what the author wrote about and put it in terms of my own life. Maybe that's what being a filter means.»questa è una citazione che ho evidenziato nel libro e appena l'ho letta sapevo che dovevo inserirla qui, questa è una mini recensione in una recensione. è cosi che mi sento al riguardo di questo libro.“we accept the love we think we deserve.""“i feel infinite.”“And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”“I'm trying not to think about it too much because that makes it worse.”“so I decided to go upstairs and read.”Show more"

Cieszę się, że wpadła w moje ręce właśnie w tej chwili.Jestem pewna, że wielu z nas czuje się jak tytułowy wallflower, choć zwykle nie mówimy o tym na głos. Nie czujemy się pewnie. Mamy wrażenie, że zostaniemy niezrozumiani, dlatego pozostajemy przy ścianie, której chłód przytłacza nas coraz bardziej. Tkwimy w jednym miejscu z obawy, że nasze troski wylądują w kącie, gdy pośrodku pomieszczenia znajdzie się ktoś bardziej… Rozgadany.Atrakcyjny.Intrygujący. Interesujący.Poukładany.

It wasn't until I realized that this movie was based on a book that I decided to try to read this short book. Little did I realize that everyone else would be actively buying and borrowing copies and rave about this book as ""one of the best YA novels they've read."" It seemed the best thing to do was wait until the hype went down and try to borrow a copy from my library. Two cities and 8 years later, I've finally read this book and agree that it's a really good book. Honestly, I kind of wish I would have read it earlier when I was a teenager as I'm sure it would have helped me with my own emotions. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was a wonderful look into a young teenager who gets overlooked by others but has so much more going on in his mind then anyone would suspect. It was easy to feel sympathetic towards Charlie as he's socially awkward and lonely with emotional hidden issues. You can't help but find him quirky and endearing while he goes through his life. Sam, one of his best friends that he's in love with, was a really good soundboard to help him realize he has to fully live and take action on what he wants. She isn't the only one to try to help Charlie that he needs to participate in life to make memories and friends. We get a nice description of who Charlie is and I felt a connection to him as I too struggle to participate in life and not just go with the flow on my friends' decisions. When you trust certain people so completely that you're willing to do things you would feel uncomfortable doing with others. This is the best way to describe the friendship between Patrick, Sam, and Charlie as I felt something similar with two of my best friends that I met my freshman year in high school (like the former characters mentioned).There is a song called ""This"" by Darius Rucker that I feel fits this book and Charlie's character very well. Some of the lines go ""Maybe it didn't turn out like I plannedMaybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man"" and ""Thank God for all I missed because it led me here to this"". These lines showcase Charlie's attitude of being grateful for who he has in his life and living his life in a normal way after he has faced hardships. Even though he faces an uncertain future, Charlie's attitude of he'll be fine as he has moments in time where he feels infinite and bigger than himself make me truly feel that he's got the right idea of how to live. It's very difficult to explain the reason why this book doesn't get a perfect rating from me. A part of it is that I didn't like the character of Mary Elizabeth until later on in the book. For me, less is more with her as I find her too annoying and similar to other people who force their opinions on others. As odd as this sounds this book balances a sense of realism and unrealism throughout the events that occur. For the time, sexual assault on minors wasn't talked about too much in main media until the 1980s. This book came out in the late 1990s so it feels like mr. Chbosky was trying to get a difficult topic brought up and handled in a way that he hopes others will see that it's okay to seek help with past trauma. There are many different forms of trauma that are mentioned throughout the book that people should realize how many trigger warnings are in this book from physical assault in relationships, beatings from parents, racism, sexual assault, homophobia, etc. Everyone who deals with these traumas usually come out on top, which makes me happy but a lot of people can't handle these traumas as...easily... as the characters in this book did. The young characters are the best case scenario situations in the book with the older characters being the worst case scenarios. This book is a little over 2 decades old (holy cow!) and it's still so popular. There are three reasons I feel help keep ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" relevant. The first Charlie makes references to pop culture through music and books that are now considered classics. I personally set out to borrow some of the books from the library and made a list of songs and bands to listen to that were mentioned in the books. The second reason has to be the characters themselves. They're all pretty relatable or recognizable as some people we know in our lives. The third reason is that topics mentioned throughout the book may not go into deep details but give you enough story behind them to connect to readers as abuse sadly still happens way too often. I highly recommend this book and would definitely reread it in the future.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 3 out of 5,"December 2, 2011",12 likes,0,"Even as I finish ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", I can't help but think that while this book had its heart in the right place in several measures, it leaves me torn as to what to think about it in its aftermath. It deals with some very heavy themes - from suicide to homosexual relationships to domestic abuse to rape and molestation to drug abuse - all as interpreted in a series of letters written by Charlie - a socially inept, sheltered, yet reportedly intelligent high school freshman.I'm going to first say this - ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a decent book, but it is obviously not a book that will strike people in the same way, which is why I hesitate in recommending it. It's really dependent on how you see it for what it offers. For me, there were parts I liked, but on the whole, I couldn't help but think that other teen books have dealt with these themes with much DEEPER resonance than this book. ""Perks"" suffers from really trying to deal with too many themes in one go, and then not necessarily delving into them with as much conviction. It might be because we're seeing through the filter that is Charlie with his respective issues and such, but I think his filter wasn't strong or indicative of the character he's purported to be. Charlie's a difficult character for me to have a firm handle on, at least in the way that Chbosky writes him. His voice starts out interestingly enough, even with bits of humor, but then peters out as the narrative goes on. It's not that I didn't understand some of the first times, the social awkwardness, the dealing with the issues his family has to confront, and ultimately the pain that resides within him. All of the conflict - internal and external - seems plausible, but its presentation is haphazard. Charlie has a difficult time expressing and being honest with himself and finding what works in his life for him. That is a legitimate concern for many teens of Charlie's age, even through the letters he writes to the nameless ""friend"" in the work. But I'll say again that the narrative doesn't support it as well as it could've, because even with his cognitive limitations (seemingly taciturn and sheltered with a very low emotional tolerance), Charlie does not support the conviction and mature narrative needed for some of these events to hit home. I saw the ending coming well before it happened, and while that in and of itself struck me on some levels, the fact that I saw it coming felt like it'd added just one more notch to the emotional rollercoaster, rather than it being an event that broke my heart.Also, I'm okay with characters showing emotion (i.e. crying) in a narrative - male or female, young or old, great and small, as long as the scenes are able to support it. There are so many ways you can show emotional conviction other than simply stating them. Authors who choose to tell, rather than show, these emotional states drive me up the wall and represent some of my deepest pet peeves in all of literature. Unfortunately, Chbosky overdoes the telling with the ""he cried, she cried, I cried"" narratives in this work and I just couldn't get behind some of the scenes. Some of them were good (i.e. the scene where Charlie witnesses the exchange between his parents, his sister and brother in the car) but others distanced me from the story.Overall, I honestly think it could've been a better book, but I think there were sparks in this narrative that did stand out, so I give it props for being worth the time spent. And I give it an extra half star because I liked the audiobook narrator - Johnny Heller, who gives an excellent performance of the work.Overall score: 3/5Show more"

Profound.This read struck so many beautiful epiphanies. I think it's a must read for everyone. This review is going to be a long one cuz I have a lot of thoughts to share about the book.Charlie is 15. The book follows his journey of first year at high school, after recently losing a close friend to death. He isn't a coveted person in his school, and most students think he's a strange kid. He writes letters/diary entries on a regular basis, which is how we get to know about Charlie's life. Such narrations make for an amazing reading experience, don't they? Yeah, they really do!The book sets forth process of development, ups and downs, mistakes and achievements, learning and letting go. Which I could never find a flaw in, cuz it is development after all. The process is flawed, but beautiful. So there's nothing I found unacceptable in this book. Every bit was good.I'm listing some bits and quotes from the book which are my personal favorite.- Those moments when Charlie just looks out of his glass window, listening to a song, staring either at his own reflection or the tree beyond. Immersed in music. Sometimes just lost. Devoid of feelings and thoughts. Been there, done that. So relatable.- The poem that Charlie read out to his friends. It welled up my eyes. It was that effective for me.- And all you want is to always feel happy for them because you know that if you do, then it means that you're happy, too.An 'aha' moment for me! When we're happy we can feel happy for others too(otherwise mad at whom).- The relationship between a teacher and student was showcased very well. Teachers play an important role in the tender teen age, and Bill was no slouch, having a flair for mentoring.- The importance of siblings is highlighted so well. Charlie being there for her sister in her difficult times, and his siblings turning up for him when he needed them, was great.- Charlie's friendship with Patrick and Sam. - The book finely puts on view dealing with heartbreak and identity issues. Patrick really faced tough times, but he got through them. - Feelings of loneliness, and in turn being tempted to try harmful stuff, figuring out what's wrong with oneself, low self esteem, and a sense of responsibility towards things, have been excellently depicted.- I would give someone a record so they could love the record, not so they would always know that I gave it to them. Again, personally relatable.- Forgiving, forgetting, letting go, and moving on. Charlie, Sam, Patrick, Mary Elizabeth, all did that. We all have to do that in our lives. It's really important. It's an inevitable part of life.- Because I guess we all forget sometimes. And I think everyone is special in their own way. I really do. What a lovely thought to quote!!!- But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there.- And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have. Good and bad. Everyone needs to realise this.I would also like to accentuate that the writing style was so apt keeping in mind the narrator was a 16 yo. A casual one, easily conversational.In conclusion, I had a great time reading this book.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky Review

 I’m not sure about this one. I liked the simple, flowy, unique writing style of Chbosky’s. It was nice, descriptive in some parts; but it also felt lazy and as if many could replicate it. It was easy to read though, and I enjoyed that considering the dark topics the book discusses. This book talks a lot about a bunch of different triggering topics (TW/SPOILER)  RAPE, INCEST, CHILD MOLESTING, SUICIDE, MENTAL ILLNESS, PHYSICAL ABUSE, ABORTION, and honestly in that spoiler thing, I’m 99% sure that I forgot a lot. I liked the representation of different triggering topics and issues in the world, but at the same time I felt like Chbosky brought all of this shit up and completely dismissed it all. The main character, Charlie, goes through and/or witnesses all of this, and they mainly ignore an issue then bring up another one. Over and over and over again… How/Why did the author bring all of these topics up and continue to dismiss them as a temporary little pain for a few weeks? I’m not sure if I’m the only one to feel this way. (TW/SPOILER)  Somehow Charlie is able to get better with a few months in a psych ward in the epilogue. I find that unbelievable considering he literally witnessed physical abuse, rape, unhealthy underage drinking, and so much more. He assisted abortion, he was molested for years as a child, he delt with depression, his best friend committed suicide, his new best friend kept kissing him when he didn’t want him to… and honestly, I’m probably forgetting a lot! Oh, and he think’s its his fault his aunt died. Is that all? I’m sure it’s not! I liked the characters. They definitely had their flaws though. This book is about MC Charlie who has made it to his freshman year of high after a tough time in eighth grade. He befriends the kind seniors Sam and Patrick, and they help him throughout the year. Charlie try’s to heal after unfortunate events from the past.

3 or 3.5 stars?

 I liked the book, it made me cry; It has a lot of flaws, but in the end it was worth a read. Can’t wait to watch the movie!⨯ . ⁺ ✦ ⊹ ꙳ ⁺ ‧ ⨯. ⁺ ✦ ⊹ . * ꙳ ✦ ⊹Show more"

Most people who have read it have praised the book, and I thought it just might be the book I guess I should've read sooner. It's better late than never, right? Well, now that I've had time to mull over it, I don't know what the hype is all about!First of all, it wasn't a bad book, and it certainly has its moments. The story is in the form of letters that Charlie, a 15-year-old boy writes to an anonymous person. Pouring his heart out, he writes about what's happening in his life and what he's going through, hoping that person will try to understand him without judgment.The writing poignantly captures the struggles of being a teenager wading through the murky waters of life growing up, dealing with situations for the first time, and capturing new experiences. The book does touch upon some heavy topics such as suicide, assault, abuse, drug use, mental health issues, homosexuality, sexual experiences, abortion etc.The best part about the book is how the most simple and profound quotes/bits of advice/ideas are interspersed throughout the story, making you pause for a few breaths and contemplate life. You'll feel sad one moment and elated the next.With all that being said, I do have some issues with the book. To begin with, it doesn't feel like the book is written by a 15-year-old boy but someone much younger than him. The writing is too simple, and if we consider the protagonist as someone who loves reading and whose English teacher calls him gifted, I don't believe this is what Charlie would sound like.Another thing I don't quite get is that despite being a ""Wallflower,"" Charlie gets to hang out with the popular kids, going to parties and doing drugs. All of them believe he's special, but the writing does not convince me that he is interesting or smart in any way. To be honest, Charlie is uninteresting, and the writing is boring. I don't understand why this book is so popular. But maybe that's just me!Read on BookstagramShow more"

But in its own way, it's beautiful. I didn't know if I'd be able to relate to a 15 year old boy, and there were a lot of events that I hadn't experienced at all. But then Charlie would say something about how he was feeling, and I'd find myself nodding and thinking, ""Yeah, I know what he means."" This book was like a therapy session or a really good talk with a friend that you didn't know you needed and didn't realize you were making a breakthrough.... until it was happening.

Okay, so I read this book for the first time last month and while I didn't think it was as perfect as most people say, I did like it. It's a realistic, emotional book about a teenaged boy named Charlie who has... well, problems. You know as soon as you start reading that there's something a little off about him and you don't really know why until the end of the book. By then, it makes sense.While this revelation in the last pages is a sad one, there is hope in the end and I was left praying Charlie would be okay--yes, I know he's not a real person, but you know what I mean.In terms of the writing, Mr. Chbosky puts you completely inside Charlie's head. It honestly felt like I was reading letters from a real person and there were times when I had to remind myself that this was fiction. The voice was so real, as well as the other characters and the problems they faced. For better or for worse, real teenagers do the same things that the characters in this book do. It's a little depressing, but Chbosky chose to stay true to this fact and not candy-coat anything.There are also some very memorable lines in this book that I found myself pondering. While I didn't have much in common with any of these characters, the quotes bridged the gap between them and me. They are quotes that everyone can relate to in one way or another and they show that no matter how different we are, we are all similar in some way.I wouldn't call The Perks of Being a Wallflower a fun read due to amount of anxiety and stress I felt for Charlie, so I can't recommend it to someone looking for fluffiness. But if you want something with emotion and a touch of grittiness, this is an excellent choice.OVERALL: 4 starsShow more"

As a teenager I was very isolated for a while and not very good at connecting with other people. Fortunately, this has changed over the years but I think this is the exact kind of book which would have helped me in this situation. I could identify a lot with Charlie, although I did not go through such as terrible things as he did in my childhood. This book is a perfect reflection on coming of age and all the struggles it includes. Although we only followed Charlie´s perspective, that did not make all the side-characters less interesting. Especially Patrick´s story arc was awesome. Sometimes I found it shocking how fast the atmosphere of the book changed so drastic, when I was reading about a happy situation with Charlie and his friends and only a few pages later the book was dealing with topics like drug consumption, sexual abuse or suicide. Nevertheless, despite all those shocking stuff this book includes, it still left me feel satisfied and heart-warmed in the end, what is always a good sign. At one or two points, I had the feeling that the characters were talking a little bit too philosophical for teenagers, but that did not change anything about my enjoyment, so it doesn´t really matter. By the way, I already seen the movie adaptation with Logan Lerman and Emma Watson a few years ago and reading the book made me appreciate this movie even a bit more. Although this book is a bit unusual for my reading taste because it is contemporary and also the first epistolary novel I ever read, I´m not lying when I say that this is one of my favorite reads this year so far. Well-deserved 5 of 5 stars!Show more"

 If you've read reviews of this book, you'd probably notice how most of them picked the same quote, which is why I decided to pick a different one that will convince you just how adorable Charlie, the MC of this book is.This book is very easy to read as this was written as a personal letter which was meant to read by someone. Words used were typical for a 15 yr old high school guy but with deeper meaning and thoughts. I never really thought I'd end up liking this book since I was having a hard time starting the first few chapters of the book which is being narrated by a 15 yr old guy who cries on every little things.

I am trying to finish reading all the books he reads and have made a playlist of the songs on the mixtape he made for Patrick. The last two sentences of the book never fail to make me smile and choke up: So, if this does end up being my last letter, please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And I will believe the same about you. There's a reason I recommend this book all the time (incidentally, it was the first book I recommended to my boyfriend). I look forward to my re-read next year. -----I liked the way this book was writeen as letters to a ""friend"" from Charlie.

It slightly covers ever adolescent issues that teenagers face every day. ButRelating to this book was tough. I mean – come on, I’ve never done pot, smoked like a chimney, drank as much a liquor store, and still managed to get straight A’s. I mean is that even possible? Nor, have I met a boy who doesn’t know what masturbation is – I don’t care what people say, but the ending doesn’t explain it thoroughly. There was numerous touching quotes which I loved from time to time. The characters were average. They were sometimes tedious, unfunny and just mah. I primarily felt this book was provoking bad behaviour. I’m pretty sure not one person said anything about drugs affecting your health. Charlie got stoned numerous times, yet however he was still intelligent beyond his years. Apparently, not intelligent enough to say “no” to fucking drugs. Overall, I'm simply not impressed with this over-hyped book. 3/5 because it certainly wasn’t that bad. Show more"

He tries soo much for his friends even though sometimes it's hard but he still keeps trying his best to be a good son,a good brother,a good friend and a good student.Books like these makes you really wish there was a second book to it,another chance to peek into Charlie's life and how he moves on when so much his group circle has diminished.

I don't know where I'm going with this review haha.

As I’ve grown up, I’ve started to become more aware of Charlie’s immaturity during the book, but I don’t necessarily look at it as a negative. I was certainly immature heading into high school, and even a late bloomer in college. So there are a lot of lines in this book that resonate with me, and a ton of highlights and notes in my copy of the book. It’s interesting to see how Charlie’s experiences with new friends and love, paired with his childhood experiences, affects his growing up and who he becomes, or who he’s on the road to becoming. I also love the format of the book, and how it is a series of letters.

We follow him as he navigates his way through the difficulties of finding new friends whilst understanding his social anxiety. His struggles to cope with the suicide of his friend Michael. The death of his favourite Aunt, and the ever changing dynamic and behaviours of his family.The book is written from a letter writing perspective. Charlie, writing to a hidden figure who for the duration of the book is never revealed. Expressing his thoughts, feelings, anxieties, and secrets to an unknown 'friend'.For a short book (just over 200 pages), it crams in a broad spectrum of trauma situations. Please check trigger warnings before reading (dr*g use/suicide/abuse/DV/SA, to name a few). You completely go into this book wanting to understand Charlie. It's clear right from the beginning that he finds articulating his emotions difficult, and he really wants to 'people please' even when it means him feeling distressed and hurt in doing so. A loyal young man who just seeks love and friendship and wants to understand the world. The book is well written, and with the way you invest in the main character, Charlie, it carries you quickly through the pages. Difficult topics come thick and fast throughout, so please be aware. A real rollercoaster of emotions and a main character that will be stuck in your mind long after you finish reading.4****Show more"

On every page Chbosky swings a sledgehammer of teenage-'event'-misery at the reader in a desperate attempt to invoke compassion for the weirdly flat tidal waves of emotion he calls characters. For a bunch of people who do nothing but cry, the characters in Perks... seem amazingly devoid of depth or feeling or even self awareness. I suppose this could be written off by saying that the majority of teenagers really are obnoxious idiots with boring lives, but Chbosky's insistence on pumping the book with as much melodrama as possible makes me think he would disagree with that statement.The worst is obviously Charlie who, quite surprisingly for a narrator & lead character, has no real personality traits. After 200+ pages what we know about Charlie is; He cries a lot.He's naive to the point that he doesn't understand anything.He doesn't express any opinions, and usually doesn't seem to have any.We later learn that he was molested, which is apparently offered as the explanation for his naivety and his crying habit. The standard reading of the book also seems to be that Charlie is moderately autistic (which I had also assumed from early on), but it's never explicitly stated. Looking at how sensationalistic the rest of the book is, I doubt Chbosky would waste an opportunity to pump the book with one more hot-button melodrama 'issue' by leaving it as a mere inference, so I'm going to go ahead and assume that this perception is just a byproduct of the lousy writing/character development.There are two other major aspects of Charlie that the book repeats ad nauseam* which are:1) He's a talented writer.2) He's super great and everyone likes him.Bullshit.The whole subplot of Charlie's English teacher, Bill, taking a great interest in him and assigning him extra books to read is just laughable. Charlie's writing, as shown in the letters that compose the book, is bland and awkward, and he offers no insights into any of the books he mentions other than 'it was good' and usually that he didn't understand some part of it. How are we supposed to believe this kid is some sort brilliant bookworm when he never displays any sort of critical thinking and writes at a level that's age appropriate at best?And then there's the whole matter of how much everyone loves Charlie. Really? This is the kid that all the cool stoner grunge kids want to hang out with? I wonder where Chbosky went to high school that this seems even remotely plausible to him. As someone who spent the majority of high school locked in bathroom stalls sobbing and having panic attacks, I can assure you that crying constantly and never having anything to say is not the key to hooking up with cool seniors who want to drop acid with you and buy you old typewriters.Beyond the flatness of the characters**, the book's largest flaw is that it tries too much. Way, way too much. Charlie's life is a constant barrage of afterschool special worthy catastrophes. My sister needs an abortion! I took acid and now things look funny! My best friend killed himself! My dad slapped me! My sister's boyfriend hit my sister! My friend is cheating on his girlfriend! I saw a rape, what do I do?! And on and on and on. In almost every other letter Charlie introduces some new problem he needs to deal with and then... nothing. Some of them are resolved almost immediately, some stick around a while longer, others just seem to be forgotten. There's so much going on that none of the individual incidents carry any real emotional weight, either for Charlie or the reader. In the beginning you think this is going to be a book about a teenager struggling to understand his only friend's suicide, but Chbosky only mines that misery mountain for a few letters before dropping it for the majority of the book. Charlie's sister's abortion is made out to be something traumatic while it's happening but by the next page it's clear that it's not going to be relevant or even mentioned again. It's as if Chbosky was issued a list of teen-drama issues and challenged to write a ceaseless stream of melodrama, including everything in as few pages as possible.How this rose above the tide of identical teen bullshit novels to become 
the
 teen bullshit novel is mysterious to me.* And Perks... contains a great deal of repetition.** I don't care to go into detail for each character, but they're all depthless and utterly bland. The most compelling idea Chbosky has for a 'character' is a secretly gay quarterback. Will the cliches never end?Show more"

Muchas lectoras me han dicho que era su libro favorito o que había significado mucho para ellas. Así que cuando me decidí a leerlo, lo hice pensando en todas esas recomendaciones. Vale, el libro no es malo, pero tampoco lo tildaría de gran suceso.La novela está escrita de manera epistolar, les recuerdo que este recurso es muy antiguo y fue popular con libros como Las amistades peligrosas. Así que para todas esas personas que dicen que es algo innovador, no, no lo es. La narración está en primera persona desde el punto de vista del protagonista, Charlie. Hay continuos saltos temporales, entre recuerdos, sueños y anécdotas; lo cual hacen una lectura lenta, cuesta avanzar hasta el tema central, el cual tiene poca definición.Charlie es un muchacho de quince años con problemas psicológicos que va a comenzar el secundario, no tiene amigos y no sabe cómo conectarse con el mundo que lo rodea. Con el apoyo de su profesor de Literatura (mucha intertextualidad), y de Sam y Patrick, unos chicos más grandes, que tienen sus propios traumas, que lo incluyen en su grupo, Charlie empezará a conocer el mundo de un adolescente... Aclaración: No la vida de cualquier adolescente: escuela, amigos, fiestas, salidas y tal vez una cerveza compartida entre todos o un paquete de cigarrillos que compran en el quiosco y esconden en la mochila con miedo de que sus padres los descubran. No, no, la vida de un adolescente que ha tocado fondo.Chbosky tocará temas peliagudos como la droga, la masturbación, el alcohol, las violaciones, el sexo adolescente, el embarazo y el aborto, la violencia de género y los excesos. Cuando uno lee algo así, piensa que tal vez esté frente a un libro moralista, pero nada más lejos que eso. Encontrar alguien que te venda droga y consumirla sin que tus padres se den cuenta parece muy fácil tal como te lo cuenta Charlie. A lo único que realmente se opone nuestro personaje es a la violencia de género y a la violación sexual, porque para el resto de los temas, lo pasa bastante bien. En la solapa del libro dice ""...empieza a comprender lo que es crecer y hacerse adulto."" ¿Charlie realmente lo comprende? No, no lo hace. Y las continuas escenas donde el sexo promiscuo y los excesos con la droga y el alcohol aparecen en primer plano no ayudan a ese propósito. Si bien es algo ingenuo decir que es algo inapropiado para los adolescentes, también está mal decir que es algo normal. Porque, que suceda es una cosa, que este bien es otra. Charlie consume, pero jamás se hablan de las consecuencias de consumir. Si me preguntaran, no, no recomiendo esta lectura para menores de dieciocho.Dejando de lado el contenido amoral y el debate de si es recomendable o no que un adolescente lo lea, podemos decir que Las ventajas de ser invisible es una novela estilo epistolar que comienza como el relato de un adolescente acerca de su primer año en el secundario y que no tiene ningún otro fin que el de mostrar las vidas con exceso y traumas de toda índole.¿Es posible identificarse con algunos personajes? Eso depende de cada uno, pero no hay que confundir identificación (Igualar o concordar el modo de pensar o vivir de una persona con otra) con proyección (mecanismo psicológico por el cual una persona le atribuye a otra un comportamiento o un sentimiento propio que ella misma no se atreve a reconocer). Todos tenemos nuestros propios traumas o problemas, no me he identificado con ningún personaje de la novela, cosa que si me ha ocurrido con Bajo la misma estrella y La lección de August, dos libros parecidos a este, pero a los cuales realmente recomiendo leer.Con momentos tristes, alegres y románticos, Las ventajas de ser invisible es un libro no adecuado para todos, pero que se deja leer.Show more"

I premda se to osjeca vrlo njezno i suptilno, nisam stekla dojam laznosti ili kao da autor ne zna o cemu zapravo pise. On se cak i ne bavi studijom karaktera. Valjda su zato svi pomalo stereotipni u nacinima na koje upadaju u (samo)destruktivna stanja. Pretpostavljam da bi cak kroz dnevnicke zapise bilo gotovo nemoguce dozivjeti sve slojeve od koji smo napravljeni i napravljene. Da ne odugovlacim, imala sam dojam da su likovi i tijek radnje simplificirani namjerno, upravo zato sto je najveca ljepota i prednost ove knjige sve one svakodnevne situacije u kojima autor na izrazito lijepi i neobican nacin izgovori glasno ono sto svi znamo ili osjecamo. Mozda generaliziram i zvucim pateticno, ali trebas se naci u situaciji da listas ovu knjigu, pa da ti osobna iskustva produ kroz glavu. Od nekih opcih stvari, primjerice izgovora i nekih tuznih zivotnih prica, odnosima koji su snazno utemeljeni na ljubavi (pritom ne mislim iskljucivo na onu partnersku), bratsko-sestrinskih razmirica iako bi za njih dvije minute kasnije dala dio sebe, prizora obiteljskih okupa i toga ""kako se svi medusobno vole, ali se nitko nikome zapravo ne svida."" ili samo o potrebi pripadanja nekoj skupini ljudi bez obzira na to koliko mislili da smo cudni.Zapravo, dalo mi je razmisljati o dvije stvari. O tome kako je nacin funkcioniranja (pritom mislim na opcedrustvetni) ponekad i promasen, ali kako te netko nekad treba nauciti da znas igrati i po takvim pravilima i birati svoje bitke. Kako se treba suzdrzavati od bilo kakvih prvoloptaskih osuda i kako nismo najpametniji cak i kad bi se zakleli da jesmo (dobro je prisjetiti se svako malo ovih stvari) i kako je od nekog snaznog dojma do potpune ignorantnosti zapravo jako tanka linija.Charlieja sam dozivljavala cudnim ali na neki dobar puknuti nacin. Jest da je neobican i ""hipersenzibilan"" (ili su svi oko njega bas izrazito okrutni), ali priznajem da stvarno nisam ocekivala da ce glavni okidac biti zlostavljanje. Vjerojatno i zbog laganog stila i cinjenice da imam tendenciju doslovno se prepustiti tekstu, ignorirati nelogicnosti (ukoliko one stvarno ne smetaju jako) i zanesti se necim sto mi je izrazito lijepo, pa biti slijepa na ocigledno. Da, na kraju sve ima smisla i nije bas skroz neocekivano, iako pomalo jest, ali se pitam koliko je to zapravo bilo potrebno? Pored svega cime je glavni lik vec bio opterecen. Ne mislim da se o takvim stvarima ne treba glasno govoriti, nego mislim o tome koliko je zapravo potrebno sustavno opterecivati vlastitog lika u knjizi, kad nije bas da se zivot samo tako moze svesti na niz uzasnih iskustava. Zapravo mislim da bi i bez svih tih hipertrauma knjiga bila mozda i bolja. Prirodno je da suosjecas, ali najvise sam suosjecala u situacijama koje su bas skroz uobicajene i svakodnevne i tu bih rekla da se krije Chobskyjev talent. Sve drugo je nekako na cudan nacin bilo neprirodno? Show more"

I'm glad that I did, because it was really good. I couldn't help but feel bad for Charlie & laugh at parts that were hilarious. I did feel like I was reading the letters of a 10 year old than a 15/16 year old boy. He seemed so childish and soft, but that's how it's supposed to be. I'd recommend this book to everyone because it was THAT good. It's one of those types of books that after your done with the entire book, your just silent. Then you head on over to youtube and type in: The Smiths - ""Asleep"" just to see what all the hype is about with Charlie loving the crap out this song. It is a really great song too. I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out next year (2012) and see how Emma Watson portrays ""Sam"" & if Logan Lerman can pull off ""Charlie"". I'm excited to see Ezra Miller play ""Patrick"" & I hope they keep the moment between patrick and charlie in the movie. GO READ THIS BOOK.EDIT: After watching the movie!THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER (Movie Rating: 2.5 stars)Let me just say one thing, there are plenty of authors that would kill to have a lot of input in their book to movie adaptions and Stephen Chbosky got to direct his! the author got to direct his own book to movie adaption, how fucking awesome is that? it's awesome... but you'd think that since he got to direct it that he'd do a bomb ass job, that he'd bring everything to life and make it an awesome movie... but no, he cut important things from the book, added unnecessary drama, and pretty much made it a regular old teen movie, he castrated his own book to be honest. I loved the casting except for Nina Dobrev as Charlie's sister, she looked nothing like Logan and I feel the director nabbed her because she's big right now. But that is just my opinion. Emma Watson was perfect as Sam and Ezra Miller was also perfect as Patrick and Logan, oh logan, he was magfuckingnificent as Charlie. But the movie fell flat in some ways and I wish it was done better. If you saw this movie and thought it was one of the best you've seen, you probably didn't read the book, or if you did I don't know what to say to you lol but again this is just my opinion. What I really liked about the movie was that he kept it in the 90s and didn't modernize it. In the end I was disappointed with the story line but the actors made me like the movie a little bit.-R.D.Show more"

I’m just some kid you don’t even know. (Though let’s be honest—we both live in a small town in Pennsylvania, so I’m sure you figured out who I am by my third letter, which really only makes me wonder why you haven’t found me and offered any kind of real help.)     When I told Bill about my disappointment with this book I just read, he said, “Charlie, we accept the books we think we deserve.” I don’t know what that means, but I assumed it was wise, so I nodded and agreed, in order to make Bill feel good. As you know, Bill gives me a lot of books to read, and I love them all and apparently write essays about them. I guess you might want to hear what it is I’m getting out of any of those books, but I think I’ll continue to not tell you anything about them at all. I don’t know why I do that.     Patrick and Sam and I were at the Big Boy today, and at one point when they were laughing at me after using me for something or other, Patrick told me that there are perks to being a wallflower. I don’t have any idea what those perks might be, and actually I don’t think the term “wallflower” is even the right word for what I am. But I laughed along with them, because they are such great friends. They’re always introducing me to interesting new experiences.     Anyway, I don’t think you should read the book I just finished, even though it’s pretty short, because there are so many better books in the world to read.                                                                 Love always,                                                                 CharlieShow more"

Y es de un libro que leí por primera vez hace siete años, por ahí de 2013. Este año decidí volver a leerlo y saber que tanto había cambiado mi opinión sobre el libro a lo largo de los años.Cuando leí el libro por primera vez, ya había visto la película, la cual me pareció excelente, entonces tuve grandes expectativas al leerlo en ese entonces. Esta semana decidí volver a él y volver a vivir la experiencia.Creo que volver a leer un libro luego de varios años, te cambia la perspectiva de las cosas, ves a los personajes de forma diferente, la historia, la narrativa y la enseñanza que este deja en ti.La vida de Charlie me sigue pareciendo triste, incluso al final. Ahora que tengo una mejor perspectiva de las cosas, puedo decir que el libro tiende a ser un poco conflictivo, porque las situaciones que se hacen presentes no son desarrolladas como deberían, solo están. Al ser un libro que maneja temas serios como el suicidio, el aborto, la violencia de género y la violación sexual, creo se quedó corto al tratar estos temas de manera más seria y consciente.A pesar de que la personalidad de Charlie en compleja y difícil de asimilar, pude relacionarme personalmente con él, así que pude entender su forma de ser ante ciertas situaciones, sobre todo en lo enfocado a las relaciones sociales con otras personas.Tener 15 años y sentirse solo en el mundo es difícil, y creo algunos pasamos por eso en nuestra adolescencia. Así que encontrar amigos por primera vez, en este caso Sam y Patrick es lindo y divertido, pero a la vez nuevo, lo cual trae consigo nuevos retos. Junto a ellos, Charlie empieza a probar nuevas experiencias: conoce las drogas, el primer amor, las amistades, ya sean buenas o malas y sobre todo la sexualidad.Show more"

I didn't understand Charlie at all. He was too emotional and too inocent for a 15 year old. I kept thinking I was reading the book from a 12 year's point of view. I did find the concept interesting, that he was writing letters to a stranger, because he had heard someone mention that the stranger didn't sleep with another girl at a party, even if he could have. So, Charlie believes that this person has morals and would therefore, understand him better. I liked his friends Patrick and Sam, even if they did get him into a lot of things, like weed and drinking and smoking. They always cared about him. At the end of the book, I was shocked, I felt like someone had hit me over the head. Suddenly, I understood Charlie and why he was the way he was. It made me feel sick, that things like that happen in the world every day.This is the type of book I wish I had read at University, like The God of Small Things and Possessing the Secret of Joy.

I really liked Chobsky's writting style: what a great idea to have these letters (and not a diary) to get the reader closer to the main character, as if we were the recipient. Charlie's writing flows as he is confiding, trying to answer this great question of all times: what is love? Something that each of us is trying to understand, ans as a teenager, starting high school, it is definitely harder to tackle with.Charlie is a great tribute to all my students... I could recognize that student who tried to jump out of his dorm room window on the 3rd floor because of a girl who didn't want to hang out with him. I saw that other student who tried to commit suicide because she felt different. I had a glance at that student who was lesbian and was fighting to hide it from her parents... and that one who was an artist (a great draughtsman) and decided he couldn't get with his stepfather and so decided to be homeless instead... eventually, I saw each of them, all these faces smiling, crying, laughing, joking, going through hogh school and adolescence and simply living.

Friendship, learning how to cope with grief, and growing up are large themes displayed in this short and simple, yet powerful and effective novel. Important lessons also are included in this book. Moving on with life is one of the major lessons presented. “Because things change, and friends leave, and life doesn't stop for anything” I would strongly recommend this book to teenagers due to the fact that Chbosky writes about many modern day issues teens are faced with today, such as: drugs, alcohol, depression, independence, and high school relationships. Although his way of writing is simple, Stephen Chbosky does a magnificent job in conveying the personalities of his characters and themes.

En las cartas, Charlie nos cuenta su experiencia en el primer año de instituto, las cuales resultan a la vez particulares y comunes, ya que este adolescente es bastante tímido y poco sociable, quizás un típico nerd, sin embargo, llega un momento en que Charlie conoce a Sam, Patrick y su círculo de amigos, probándose en situaciones que no había vivido con anterioridad.En ciertos momentos, las cosas que Charlie hacía me resultaron muy de seguir al rebaño, pero en ciertas situaciones se llegaba a traslucir su verdadera personalidad.

Porque todo lo que paso en la película yo no lo había podido entender en el libro. 5 años después lo vuelvo a leer y ENTIENDO TODO. Yo diría que es un libro para mayores de 15 años. Aunque me encantó, hay temas que fueron mal tratados en mi opinion. Hay aborto, violación, abuso sexual infantil, incesto, ansiedad, depresión etc etc pero se hablo de esos temas en una o dos paginas y después quedaron en el olvido, me hubiese gustado más si el autor hubiera profundizado en todo lo mencionado. Charlie es uno de mis personajes literarios favoritos 😔 hay que protegerlo. Me guardé todas las canciones que él menciono y también los libros que Bill le prestaba🥺Una de las razones por las que no le di 5 estrellas es porque se me hizo un poco raro el age gap... nunca vi a nadie hablar de eso. Charlie es un chico que recién entra en el secundario mientras que todos los demas están entrando a la universidad...🥴Show more"

Anything can be exciting, but when we don't contribute or collaborate, then exposing other side is the only option nature can choose to happen. When we accept dreadful things as they are, we are letting ourselves to suffer, even when clearly, you can change the thing, situation or whatever it is. Now, you might have some problem, a disability of expression, lack of comprehension, state of low-esteem, but these traits can be solved and should be solved first because such attitudes become the root problem. I mean, if you are the problem, which is totally fine, then become better. Rather than dissolving the matter itself, try to look upon yourself, and see whether what part of you need to gets changed. When you know the answer, advance to the real problem. Trust me, it would get easier to face. It's just that simple.Masterpiece, Stephen Chbosky! 😍💖Show more"

The unique journalistic quality of the narrative captured my attention, but didn't offer the look deep into Charlie that I hoped it would at the outset of my reading experience. I started the novel with myriad questions about Charlie and his story, and was left wanting in answers at the end. I enjoyed reading the book, but it was light, impactless reading. I didn't come away changed, which is what I seek in any novel. Chbosky accomplished his goal of making a heart wrenching novel to make readers cry, but in a thin, disappointing way. At some parts, I saw right through the story, straight through to a thinly veiled, blatant attempt at tear-jerking. Ultimately, Perks of Being a Wallflower is cheap and pointless. I probably should have given up on this one when I saw the MTV logo. -David AmbroseShow more"

E ainda bem que o fiz! :) Fiquei agradavelmente surpreendida por encontrar um enredo consistente e profundo e uma escrita leve e fresca. É através das cartas que envia a um ""Amigo"", desconhecido pelo leitor, que conhecemos Charlie, um rapaz de 15 anos, que perdeu recentemente o seu melhor amigo que se suicidou.Nessas cartas, Charlie descreve a sua relação com os novos amigos, com a família, com os professores, nomeadamente Bill, o professor de Inglês de quem gosta muito e ficamos a saber a sua história; uma história que vale mesmo a pena conhecer! ;DRecomendo a todos este livro e espero que gostem tanto como eu gostei! :D Show more"

On the one hand, this book is really sad and talks about something really deep and disturbing. But on the other, this book shows real hope and not kitschy hope when everything is getting better all at once and all the characters live happily ever after. It shows the real progression a human being can make in order to get better and to get a better hold on their lives. For me, this book really represents what good literature should be like, which is to make its reader feel something, even if it is unpleasant at the time. And especially when it ends on a really touching and emotional note of hope, like in this one.Everything just to say that this book is one, if not the, most important book I have ever read and I think will ever read.You can find my entire review right here: https://reviewswithsprinkles.com/2015...Show more"

Положителните страни, които открих в нея, бяха пъстрите персонажи и това как бяха представени те. Хареса ми и формата, под която беше представен сюжетът – чрез писма на главния герой, в к��ито той разсъждаваше за случките, за които разказваше. Негативите бяха, че така и не успях да се потопя истински в историята – сюжетът на моменти се движеше изключително бавно и протяжно. Взаимоотношенията между героите ми се струваха странни и на моменти не ги разбирах напълно. Вероятно защото самите персонажи бяха коренно различни от мен и от обкръжението ми, не знам.

Charlie reminds me of the introverted me. Teen problems that can arise by teen perception/drama are dwarfed by the real problems that Charlie has. His normal house with normal family with normal school has the real twists that all our 'normal' lives are susceptible to. Its just that you don't usually get this story out in the open the way this book exposes it.

Čarli upravo započinje srednju školu, i susreće se sa svim životnim izazovima i lekcijama koje možete zamisliti u tom uzrastu, pa čak i nekim koje bi možda mogle doći i kasnije, a idealno nikada. Kako bi nadoknadio gubitak svog najboljeg prijatelja, počinje da povremeno piše nama nepoznatoj osobi koja je učinila jednom nešto veoma ispravno u Čarlijevom prisustvu. Već na stranicama tih pisama, vidi se da Čarli osoba koja se retko sreće: izuzetno senzitivan, veoma perceptivan, sa jakim osećajem za dobro i loše, ali i totalno neprilagođen društvu koje otvoreno zazire od svega što im nimalo ne nalikuje. Ovo ga čini veoma usamljenim titularnim marginalcem knjige, sve dok ne sretne i ne sprijatelji se sa Patrikom i Sem, bratom i sestrom koji uspevaju da ga otkriju kao izuzetno dobru i darovitu osobu ispod svih njegovih nekonvencionalnih misli i manira. Tako počinje jedna godina u njihovim životima, koja nosi mnogo promena za svakog, a ponajviše za Čarlija. Veoma mi se dopao stil u kojem su pisma/knjiga napisani. Uverljivo dočarava svako Čarlijevo emotivno stanje i duboke misli koje ga muče, kako one dolaze u njegov fokus i kako ga napuštaju; sa lakoćom ga mogu zamisliti za stolom kako ih piše svom misterioznom primaocu. Ako bi šta mogla reći da mi se nije dopalo čitajući, to bi bilo da ću je vrlo brzo zaboraviti. Prednosti jednog marginalca je knjiga momenta, opisuje život u kojem se nešto stalno menja i gde samo neke stvari provlače iz meseca u mesec. Do sledećeg puta kada budem sela da je ponovo okrenem, veći deo knjige ću čitati kao iz prvog puta. Show more"

I thought the writing style being comprised of letters was so unique. The letters provided a special intimacy and insight into the characters' lives that you wouldn't get otherwise. I loved getting to know Charlie and watching him thrive with his friends. The pain of saying goodbye to them after they graduated made me so sad. But I think Charlie was so funny at times and I appreciated the laugh. Would recommend this book. Show more

And maybe we’ll never know most of them. But even if we don’t have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there.I had read this book last year in the month of August, and I remember asking myself, “what’s the big fuss about? It isn’t that great a book.” I ended up giving it three stars and moving on. I found so many beautiful books after reading it that I totally forgot about it, until this year, when I suddenly started feeling that even though I had given it a three-star rating, it was actually a beautiful book that I would love to read again. And I did read it again, and even though it didn’t blow me away, I liked it a lot.It’s strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book.This book is about an observant teen, Charlie, who starts high school. Charlie has a unique way of seeing the world, and he puts all of his thoughts and the things going around him in the letters he sends to some stranger.This book is super short. Only 224 pages. And it talks about so many important subjects in those 224 pages.These include suicide, trauma, drug abuse, sexual assault, child abuse, domestic violence, homophobia, teenage pregnancy, abortion, blame, grief, death of a loved one, racism, bullying, cheating on your partner, divorce, et cetera. Just wanted to say it once again.Even though it deals with all these subjects, it is not depressing. And even though it is not depressing, I vaguely remember blinking away my tears quite a few times while reading it. I’m not a big crier, I should mention it already.I love epistolary novels. I didn’t use to, before. And perhaps I liked it more this time because of this fact?I perhaps also loved it more because it’s about a person’s most important years. I have only read a handful of novels that actually focus on the teenage years of a person. They usually talk about their romantic relationships and relationships with friends and families, but this book talks about so many other aspects of being a teenager, and they include taking a driver’s ed class, getting your driver’s license, discovering your sexuality, questioning your place in this world, getting stoned for the first time, trying to discover new things about people who are around (usually adults), making out for the first time, learning so many things that would make you a more complex human, being in a relationship for the first time and not knowing how to put your thoughts across because you’ve never been in a relationship before (duh), etc. And that is why I loved it more. It is a perfect YA for me.It is also written in very simple language (well, because it’s in the point of view of a fifteen-year-old who is learning new words). However, Charlie’s voice is kinda like a 12-year-old’s voice, and even though I wanted to ignore it, I couldn’t.I’m not sure I like all the characters in this book, especially because I think I don’t like everyone around me in real life. The characters feel real to me.I like Charlie enough (and even though he and I aren’t like each other one bit, I relate to him on so many levels), and his parents, but I’m not sure I liked his friends, Sam and Mary Elizabeth and Patrick, and even his brother and sister. They do sound condescending and often act like Charlie is too young, and sometimes they’re extremely protective of him.Also, Sam and Patrick are not ideal friends. They’re not always there when Charlie needs them.They disappear and don’t take his calls when he needs someone to listen to him, but he’s there for them. So, I don’t think I would want to be friends with them, but again, I don’t have to like everyone, right? And people are like that. Flawed.This book also has a lot of beautiful quotes that made the hairs on my arms stand up straight. If you don’t want to read this book for anything that’s mentioned above, just read it for the beautiful quotes.So, if you want to experience something that would make you feel infinite, you should read this book. I feel extremely satisfied with this book, and even though I didn’t give it 5 stars, I absolutely loved it in a way I can’t describe.------Original rating: 3/5 startsShow more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4615099-emma,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"August 7, 2011",10 likes,0,"Book Review: The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen ChboskyIn August of 1991 fifteen-year-old Charlie begins writing letters about his life to a stranger who he thinks will listen and understand. He doesn’t want this person to know who he is, so he has changed all the names of the people in his life. Charlie has a tendency to over think things, and prefers to look on from the sidelines than to participate. As he starts high school, he is still trying to get over the recent suicide of his best friend Michael. Charlie soon befriends Patrick and Sam and is introduced to their friends. Their world is one full of sex, drugs, love, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, mixed tapes, and moments that make you feel infinite. I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower for the first time when I was about sixteen. I’d heard a lot of people my age say that this was their favourite book, and I thought that it didn’t live up to their praise. It felt like too much happened, as if the writer had tried to fit everything that could happen to a teen in one book. I would have probably given it 3/5 at most. Earlier this summer, I decided to give it another shot, 5 years after I first read it. I was surprised to find myself loving this book. All the things that felt like too much the first time didn’t bother me. This time the events didn’t feel forced. A lot of major issues are addressed but that didn’t stop me from liking Perks. So, there you have another example of me completely disagreeing with my past self about books. Charlie is easily the most honest and insightful teenage narrator I can think of. He thinks about and questions everything, and looks at things in a unique way. Charlie’s insights are what a lot of people love about this book and why it is so often quoted. He is very naïve and innocent as the novel begins, making his voice distinctive and unlike the average teenager. Sometimes when the writing style in a book is like that I have difficulty getting used to it, but this wasn’t the case with Perks. The writing style reminds me a bit of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time and The Catcher in the Rye. Chbosky was influenced by Holden Caulfield while writing this book, and he pays homage to that by having Charlie read The Catcher in the Rye. Charlie’s English teacher Bill assigns him extra novels to read and write about throughout the school year. Charlie’s favourite book is always the last one he has read, and I liked the discussion of books, movies and music throughout the novel. All those things were a huge part of my teenage years, and I always like to see them mentioned in books. Plus the mere mention of mixed tapes makes me nostalgic. Charlie’s friends and family felt very realistic to me. I’ve heard some people ask why people like Sam and Patrick would be friends with Charlie, but I think that they liked how different he was and that he listened to them. I’ve also heard people refer to Charlie as a Gary Stu and I completely disagree. Charlie is very flawed and both Bill and Sam point out how he needs to participate and not put others before him. Although there are perks to being a wallflower, Charlie needs to stop watching from the sidelines. The ending was surprising and gave insight on why Charlie is the way he is. After I finished reading this book the second time, I tried to put my finger on what makes this book special. It wasn’t the great quotes or the characters, but how poignant this book is. What makes me love The Perks of Being a Wallflower is how real the emotions in this book feel. A lot of the things that happened to Charlie have never happened to me, but while reading this book it felt as if they had. 4.5/5 ""So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.""Show more"

Birkaç yıldır pek çok okurun listesinin başköşesindeydi kitap. Bu sene filmi çıkınca daha bir göze batmaya başladı. Filmi izlemeden kitabını okumak her zaman daha cazip gelmiştir bana. Çoğu zaman hayal kırıklığına uğrasam da kafamda yarattığım sahnelerle yönetmenin yarattığı sahne arasındaki farklılıkları bulmak bile bana zevk verir. Hem kitabı deli gibi merak ettiğimden -eğer Tumblr hesabınız varsa John Green kitapları ile beraber en çok fotoğraf�� çekilen kitaplardan biri olduğunu biliyorsunuzdur- hem de kadrosuna hayran kaldığım filmi izlemek istediğimden kitabı okumak niyetindeydim. Ancak genelde yaptığım gibi belirli bir zaman ayırmamıştım kitaba. Her şey spontane gelişti. Bir gecede kitabı edindim; sonraki gün ise sayfalarının arasında kaybolmuştum. Bir gün içinde bitirdim.“And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”Bu yazıyı yazarken kitabın beni ne kadar etkilediğini bir kere daha fark ediyorum. Çünkü kapak resmini indirirken duygulandım. Evet, çok sevmişim. Ama neden? Oralara geleceğim.Muhtemelen Çavdar Tarlasında Çocuklar/The Catcher in the Rye'ı duymuş ya da okumuşsunuzdur. İşte The Perks of Being a Wallflower tam da onun gibi bir kitap! Biraz daha modern versiyonu diyebiliriz. Tabii bundan sakın aynı oldukları veya Stephen Chbosky'nin Salinger'i kopyaladığı kanısına varmayın; yazım tekniklerinden karakter gelişimine kadar son derece farklılar. Yalnızca ikisinin de bende aynı tadı bıraktığı ve bana benzer duyguları hissettirdiğini anlatmaya çalışıyorum.Charlie on beş yaşında, liseye yeni başlamış bir delikanlı. Ancak Charlie, yaşıtlarının aksine utangaç, içine kapanık, okumaya ve yazmaya merakı olan asosyal bir genç. Bu merakı yeni öğretmeni Bill sayesinde iyice körükleniyor. Ayrıca Charlie tam bir gözlemci. Etrafında olanları farklı bir üslupla bize aktarıyor.“We accept the love we think we deserve.”The Perks of Being a Wallflower Charlie'nin adını bilmediğimiz birine yazdığı mektuplarından oluşuyor. Her mektubunda karşısındakine, dolayısıyla bize yeni bir şey anlatıyor Charlie. İlk aşkını, sevdiği şarkıları, okuduğu kitapları, yaşadığı tuhaflıkları, ilk uyuşturucusunu, ilk seksini anlatıyor. Ve bunları yürek burkucu ama aynı zamanda insanı gülümseten bir dille anlatıyor. Charlie herkesten farklı bir çocuk. Biraz fazla hassas mesela. Onu hem üzüntüden hem de mutluluktan kolaylıkla ağlatabilirsiniz. Ama Charlie'nin satırları beni öyle içine çekti, bana öyle yakın geldi ki onun yanında olsam ben de bebekler gibi ağlayabilirdim sanırım. Birlikte ağlardık.Kitapta bahsi geçen kitaplar ve şarkılar onu sevmemi bir kez daha sağladı açıkçası. Özellikle The Smiths'in Asleep'ini açıp açıp tekrar dinliyorum şimdi. Ayrıca Charlie'nin yeni arkadaşları Patrick ve Sam en az onun kadar içten karakterler. The Perks of Being a Wallflower'da gençlik ateşi, romantizm, hayal kırıklığı, mutluluk, sevgi, hayaller, şiir, müzik, eşcinsellik her şey var. Bence bu kitabı güzel kılan bir başka sebep.This one time when it’s peaceful outside, and you’re seeing things move, and you don’t want to, and everyone is asleep. And all the books you’ve read have been read by other people. And all the songs you’ve loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that’s pretty to you is pretty to other people. And you know that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing “unity.”The Perks of Being a Wallflower kesinlikle hem ruhuna hem de beynime kazınan kitaplardan biri oldu. Başrollerinde Logan Lerman ve Emma Watson'un oynadığı film uyarlamasını izlemek için sabırsızlanıyorum!""Charlie gibi kardeşim olsaydı keşke..."" diyerek yazımı sonlandırıyorum.Show more"

He talks about things that have happened to him, and things that are happening to him now. He’s quite a sensitive character, and prefers to sit on the side lines and just observe what is going on rather than taking part.It’s difficult to really say what this book is about, other than it is about Charlie’s day-to-day life, and his observations on life.To sum this book up in 1 word it would probably be ‘odd’. There were some funny moments, but most of this is just about this kid’s life, and it gets pretty dull in places. Like I say there were some funny moments, like when he starts worrying about getting a little too excited whilst playing a part in a play with a girl who he fancies, but then other parts just left me saying ‘what?’. One such moment was when he was watching an advert for an exercise machine, and he called the phone number that came up on the screen, and told the lady who answered that he wasn’t calling to buy an exercise machine, he was calling to ask her how she was. I mean just what? Why did he do that? That is just odd.This was an okay book, but there wasn’t really all that much of a plotline, Charlie was just a bit odd, and quite a lot of this was just dull. I’m not sure as I want to watch the film now, I feel like I’ve wasted enough of my life reading the book without wasting another 2 hours watching the film. I’ve also yet to work out what the ‘perks’ are, as Charlie didn’t exactly have a wonderful life. If anything this book left me feeling a little sad and ambivalent. Overall; an okay story, but pretty dull in places.6.5 out of 10Show more"

I don’t remember it being as gruesome as it was, I knew the horrific ending but forgot that all throughout it’s just full of traumatic happenings. It kind of felt like A Little Life all over again, just condensed (or I guess vice versa since this came first). It was very upsetting to read to be honest. When I think of perks I think about how romanticised the film was when it really shouldn’t have been. It’s quite a bleak book that leaves you with a weird and uncomfortable feeling.The entire time reading this, I just wanted to hug Charlie. I honestly don’t know why he was put through so much in this book, so relentlessly. I remember thinking that Sam and Patrick were great friends for him and their little trio was cute, but reading this now I was repulsed. I hated them both. They knew exactly what they were doing with a vulnerable person yet did it anyway to serve their own needs. It was just so sad to watch Charlie getting taken advantage of repeatedly and the people in his life speaking to him like he was worthless. I spent forever waiting for something good to happen, and I still don’t know if it really did.I think it was well written and the voice of Charlie was perfect. It was relatable in many ways and you do feel that hurricane of emotion and confusion that comes with being 15 and trying to find yourself when you feel so out of place in the world. I understand why I liked this so much as a teenager, but I just didn’t love it the same way now and that’s okay.Show more"

La dinámica entre Patrick, Sam y Charlie ha sido, sin duda, lo mejor de todo el libro; las conversaciones, los libros y la música que compartían, la manera que tenían Sam y Patrick de comprender las rarezas de Charlie y como se acercaban siempre a él sin juzgarlo, mirando lo que necesitaba en todo momento e intentando enseñarle siempre pequeñas cosas sobre la vida. No sé, acabar este libro te deja una sensación rara (y no sólo porque trate temas muy fuertes, que los trata), sino porque creo que los personajes son buenos. Y no porque sean perfectos, sino porque el escritor ha sabido describir a la perfección a un grupo de personas que de verdad tenían la intención de cambiar el mundo (o cambiar la forma de ver el mundo del lector o la lectora) a pequeña escala. Además, creo que no ha sido demasiado ambicioso, y se ha limitado a escribir una historia corriente pero muy emotiva.  Definitivamente el libro se podría describir algo así como lo que dijo charlie al entrar al túnel por primera vez, y ver que aquel momento era único y lo estaba viviendo con personas únicas, sin la posibilidad de contarlo días después y esperar que la gente entendiese lo banal (pero importante) que había sido: infinito, esa es la palabra. Obviamente lo recomiendo muchísimo. 5/5«Así que supongo que somos quienes somos por un montón de razones. Y quizá nunca conozcamos la mayoría de ellas.

I do think ""Wallflower"" would be best appreciated by high schoolers, as the book is too earnest and angst-ridden to be a perfect read for anyone older than teens. I wish I would have had this back in high school. Even so, I really enjoyed reading it as an adult, and it constantly triggered waves of bitter-sweet nostalgia. Not so much because my high school experience was much like Charlie's, but because his way of looking at the world, his loves, worries, and betrayals summed up high school perfectly. I appreciated that Chbosky never got TOO dramatic. When I was first given this, I was worried I was getting a ""Child Called It"" or ""Push,"" but Charlie has a relatively normal, if somewhat more eventful, Freshman year. My one real problem with the book was that at times it read like the winner of a ""Write Like Holden Caulfield"" award. ""At the school dances, I sit in the background, and I tap my toe, and I wonder how many couples will dance to ""their song."" In the background, i see the girls wearing the guys' jackets, and I think about the idea of property. And I wonder if anyone is really happy. I hope they are. I really hope they are.""

Via these letters he chronicles his life during his freshman year of high school. As the book opens, Charlie states that his friend, Michael, killed himself the prior spring. This paragraph from the first letter gives the reader a sense of the tone: So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I’m still trying to figure out how that could be.I like YA fiction like this. Charlie is very real. He has good days and not-so-good days, as he struggles to come to grips with has happened around him. His parents seem genuinely caring, though somewhat clueless about his use of alcohol. He finds new friends who also help him adjust to his new school. He is a great observer of teenage and family life. As he describes events and how he reacts to them, he gives the reader a pretty accurate view of high-school dynamics. This is Chbosky’s debut novel. Since its release he seems to have concentrated on screenwriting and directing. I hope he writes another novel; I would definitely read it. Noah Galvin does a superb job of performing the audiobook. I totally believed he was a teenaged Charlie. He is in turns excited, apprehensive, despondent, eager, cautious, frightened, and hopeful. Show more"

I didn't hate it, yet it didn't blow me away or went through me in a way that I felt like it left an impact on me. It was just.. plain. I loved the concept of telling the story through letters, as I myself love writing them so much. and I related to Charlie a lot, and at some points, it felt like I was the one talking not him. But when I look back on the reading process, I can see myself zoning in and out, I had to repeat a page more than once, because I didn't actually read it.And that's how I feel overall about the whole book.Here are quotes from when I related to Charlie's character: ""And because I don't want to start thinking again. Not like I have this last week, I can't think again. Not ever again. I don't know if you've ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting this is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That's why I'm trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.""""So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.""Show more"

I just finished this book and I feel that I need to write this review now because I'm in a trance of sorts after finishing this book. as a teenager in high school, I find that a lot of books that try to be deep and make you think just are plain dumb or not deep at all. this book, however, has gained such a place in my heart. something about it just fit me. I'm no Charlie; we don't have the same life at all, but the very fact that we don't and I still loved this book as much as I did proves the true purpose of it. Charlie mentions that watching a film is pointless if you don't feel different afterwards. I feel different after reading this book in the best way. The fact that Charlie was writing to everybody and nobody somehow made it personal and I felt for him even though it wasn't a typical way of telling a story. I really don't know how else to describe it. he summed up feelings that I have without making me cringe at it. at the end of the day, that's all you really need as a teenager, right? to have somebody tell you that you're special in a good way, that you aren't crazy, and that you aren't alone in the slightest. thanks for being my friend, charlie. love always, a friend that feels infinite <3reread: read again for school, just as incredible and heartbreaking yet hope-inducing as I remembered <333Show more"

It is also one of the first English books I read, and it was a great one to start with as someone who wasn’t good at English at all. The writing style is very simple, in form of letters to someone mysterious—maybe even you!Charlie is a very emotional, socially awkward character and I think a lot of people will be able to relate to him. Though sometimes he is a little bit too dramatic and innocent. Throughout the book, Charlie experiences a lot of new things, learns to cope with the loss of his favourite aunt and one of his friends, and meanwhile, still tries to have some kind of a social life. I wish I could explain to you how much I loved this book, but words escape me. It’s everything I wanted it to be.

I related to his character so much and the ending was just so heartbreaking I couldn't help but tear up a little. I love how this deals with every day situations that pretty much most teenagers have to face at least once in their lives, which creates an emotional roller coaster that had me laughing and on the verge of tears at many different points throughout the story.I especially loved how everyone's lives were shaped through his honest perspective and that he made sure to include everything he remembered, no matter whether those things were good or bad and overall I found it very inspirational.

I could blame the two weeks of finals/projects/presentations, but in reality, until I was half way into this, I didn't feel entirely invested. I know, I know, I think this will be the ""it book"" of our generation especially with the movie coming out. I enjoyed it, but I never felt the need to sit down and read it cover to cover.When I was 2/3rds of the way done however, that did change. I went from merely wanting to give Charlie a pat on the head and a reassuring hug to loving him. As I kept reading, I was overwhelmed with how special this book and how special Charlie was as a narrator. If you have read this, you know that there is a scene towards the end where someone goes on to describe Charlie as just that which felt a bit creepy as if the author had take the words out of my head.Books such as The Hunger Games people popular because of their plot, but with this, I think people are quietly connected to it because of the protagonist's voice.

He suddenly finds a purpose and slowly gets to ‘participate’ in life not just as an observer. While this is pretty much a standard coming of age tale, I enjoyed that it shows a male teen with a plethora of emotions, he cries a lot (too much) and is extremely sensitive. He’s not always cluey, mainly around girls or around any social interactions, even though he’s SO book smart. Most of the time he is just so cringeworthy I felt bad for him. However it was good to get a different perspective and insight to how boys can be, they aren’t all hormone filled sex maniacs as they are often portrayed in books and movies. It covers a lot of heavy topics, which is fine except there isn’t a topic he doesn’t cover, leaving me to feel somewhat manipulated incidentally it had the exact opposite effect, I lacked the sympathy this book was literally crying out for.

And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.I'm glad to find this is not overhyped! I'm probably the last person on this planet to not have watched the movie (I think I'll watch it soon I have so many things I need to watch rip), so I knew nothing about the story going in, but it was easy to understand as Charlie uses a pretty simple writing style. Also he is so pure and innocent, I've said it before but I'll say it again BLESS HIS HEART after everything he went through he's still such a cinnamon roll and I love him <3 That said, this book is all about the highschool experience™, so to anyone like me who hasn't and probably never will have this experience because they are a highly introverted mess and do not ""participate"" it will not be relatable but rather like reading about the lives of wild animals like wow! They talk to people! Go to football games! And to parties! And on dates! Hm hm very interesting indeed xD But the book also tells some important truths about love and life.I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. [...] I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.All in all, I really enjoyed this! It seems like an easy read until you look deeper, then you actually take a while to read it because it makes you think a lot. I really liked the characters and how Charlie tells the story in letters. I still want to know who he wrote to! Did he even really write to anyone? The writing wasn't really impressive, but all in all very enjoyable!Addition after watching the movie: Hm the movie was meh for me. It wasn't bad but it felt so fast and rushed compared to the book because so many things were left out. I get that a movie has to be shorter and focus more on the action scenes and all that but I liked the slower build-up of the book a lot lot more. Also maybe I just didn't notice but I think Charlie and his teacher never actually have the conversation where he tells him he should ""participate""? Yet Charlie uses the word ""participate"" a lot and I think if I hadn't read the book this would have confused me. Generally Charlie's relationship with Bill was not shown enough, we only see he gives him books and they have like two short conversations and that's it? Where is Charlie talking to him about his sister? Where is Charlie coming over to his house? Where is their relationship buildup?  Oh I missed so many scenes out of the book, everything was way too rushed in the movie :(Show more"

He does what I did for a while there: write out his feelings. But he sends them to some unnamed “friend”: is it a journal? A random letter, an appear for help? Either way, it’s a tremendously emotional, cutting and insightful tour of a troubled teen’s innermost thoughts.Oh, my. Just brilliant. I don’t agree with the synopsis, that it’s a common remembrance of the teenage years. Charlie’s much more expressive and bright than me, and he’s been through things I’d never experienced. I loved his perspective: unsure of how to interact with his friends, he defers to what others want, looking to please them, eschewing his own wants, just going with the flow. He loves his friends, sees the good and bad points, always wishing the best for them, wishing he could step out and do something. He’s an amazing gift-giver, so thoughtful and sensitive to his friends’ needs. He’s understanding and patient with everyone’s issues, but maybe not his own. The language is just perfect, depicting Charlie exactly as I’d have imagined. The story helped me remember how important mental health among teens is, how I should always be aware of what my students experience. Their emotional state is just as important as the physical, the academic, the vocational. I had a version that included a letter from 20 years later: not crazy about it, but I understand. I can see how the informality might rankle some readers, or maybe the material makes some uncomfortable. Me, I can’t find fault with it. I loved it, but you know what? I don’t / didn’t want a sequel. It was a great tale of teenage years that belongs where it belongs. One of the best teenage narratives I’ve ever read.

Descrivertela sarebbe impossibile , ma ci proverò lo stesso. Se ascolti la canzone ""Asleep"" , e cerchi di immaginare una di quelle giornate di sole in cui ogni cosa resta impressa nella tua mente , e pensi agli occhi più belli che tu abbia mai visto , e ti metti a piangere , e l' altra persona ti stringe a sé...ecco , allora forse riuscirai a vedere quella foto."" Bene, se non avete ancora ascoltato Asleep degli Smiths ,siete lontanissimi dal capire , ma più che altro dal provare, le sensazioni di Charlie e vi perdete almeno il 50% della straordinaria bellezza di questo libro...Io ,invece, che la sto ascoltando a ripetizione questi giorni proprio leggendo il libro, ma che ,sopratutto, ce l' avevo nelle orecchie ieri notte ,mentre leggevo questo passo , ho capito perfettamente cosa intendesse Charlie e mi sono sentita proprio come quando qualcuno ti porge il suo cappotto in una giornata ghiacciata ,e tu stai morendo di freddo, come se mi avessero avvolto il cuore in una coperta ,in una meravigliosa coperta soffice, e gli avessero dato del miele. 2 secondi di assoluta e incolmabile dolcezza , indescrivibile ...Mi sono sentita terribilmente Charlie ,così Charlie da arrivare a pensarla come lui in determinati momenti, da ritrovarmi nei suoi comportamenti. Charlie è sfuggente , Charlie è ""felpato"" , Charlie teme di far rumore, Charlie ama osservare, pensare ma non partecipare :""Bill ha notato che osservavo la gente e , dopo la lezione mi ha chiesto a che cosa stessi pensando. Gliel' ho detto .Lui mi ha ascoltato , annuendo , e facendo qualche verso di ""affermazione"".Alla fine , ha assunto un' espressione da ""discorso serio "". ""Pensi sempre così tanto , Charlie ?"" ""è un male ?"" Volevo solo che qualcuno mi dicesse la verità. ""Non necessariamente.è solo che a volte le persone usano il pensiero per non partecipare alla vita "" Ed è allo stesso tempo affascinate e terribile quando ti riconosci in una frase del genere , le riflessioni di Charlie mi sono terribilmente note , per averle fatte anche io, e questo è un' altro punto forte del libro; è impossibile, non riconoscere ,almeno ,una delle riflessioni di Charlie, come una delle nostre in un qualche momento della nostra vita... Charlie sarebbe l' amico perfetto per chiunque ,per chiunque , tranne che per sé stesso , comprende benissimo le altre persone , riesce a capire di cosa hanno bisogno per sentirsi bene , le ascolta , sa mantenere i segreti che gli vengono rivelati ...Che si può desiderare di più ? Solo nelle lettere a questo anonimo amico , forse riesce a sputare fuori completamente tutta l' ansia che prova , ansia, che neanche con lui, riesce ad esternare del tutto ,vomita fuori solo quello che proprio non riesce più a trattenere, con rapidi scatti , che sembrano quasi fotografie sfocate , che poi nel corso delle varie lettere si faranno pian piano più nitide , ma non aspettatevi la massima risoluzione fino alla fine ,(ah già questo è un romanzo epistolare , che sbadata non l' ho detto )per poi assentarsi di nuovo e raccontare delle altre persone con lui che è quello che sa fare meglio... è impossibile non affezionandosi agli amici di Charlie , a Patrick ,ma sopratutto a Sam (l ' adoro ),che fortunatamente alla fine del libro prende in mano la situazione e in qualche modo , anche se non proprio in maniera ortodossa, riuscendo a scuotere Charlie ( e anche me ,per fortuna )...Recensione lunghissima, e non ho detto neanche la metà delle cose ,che ci sarebbero da dire, su questo romanzo ,e su Charlie e i suoi amici . Quindi ,fate solo questo, fatevi un regalo, e leggetelo .P.S. Con un qualcosa dove sia possibile ascoltare musica nelle vicinanze ;) Show more"

Probably in my puddle of tears!

I actually really really really really really really adore this book. Yeah, it did sound cheesy here and there but the message! I actually related to Charlie. When I was 7 or 8 years old, I didn't talk much. I was that introverted shy kid who was always quiet and polite and kind. And then I started hating myself for who I was and then became popular. Like school wide popular. Almost everybody knew me. And guess what it brought me? Troubles! And Anxiety! (Idk why I talked about me)Charlie:Charlie is a shy and introverted kid who feels insecure. Throughout the book he tries to be what you call 'a cool and perfect human' (which doesn't exist). The whole book is sorrowful and the way it is conveyed! Charlie shares his life and hardships with an unknown person via letters. Charlie is not a likable person even to the readers but what he went through- THAT most of us can relate to at least some point. Your battles connect in some way or the other. Don't tell me you never suffered and lived a perfect life! My only trouble is that his character seemed bland at some points. I hate how his parents never came to his support when he was suffering from the loss of his aunt.  HE SUFFERED SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HE HAD NO ONE TO TALK ABOUT IT! DOES ANYBODY REALIZE HOW BAD THAT IS?! His had not a single person to talk to about how his aunt harassed him! It only came out at the end of the book when he could no longer carry the burden. What he did to Mae was WRONG!Sam:I hate her and love her at the same time. But I cannot stop seeing her as Emma Watson! And I love Emma Watson!!Sam too was sexually abused at a young age so we should see from her point of view too1 Though I quite agree that what she did to Charlie without his consent was wrong. It triggered him! She might have not known that but she should have asked for his permission first. Sam played in the character development of Charlie which was only seen at the end of the book!PatrickHonestly, I feel bad for Patrick. I really really liked him. He was the first person who noticed that a person named Charlie existed. He is a hilarious character who is kind and stuff. But after a terrible incident, his break-up with Brad his life was pretty much downhill. He turned out to be the worst sort of friend you could have. He was often taking Charlie to places and ditching him there. Yes, I understand he was having a hard time. But he doesn't know how that would affect Charlie. Charlie was there for Patrick, but Patrick just didn't return the favor by the end.OverallAt the end, there was so much to learn from this book. This book opened my mind from a different perspective. The message is clear but I would like you all to read it yourself and find it. The things I learned from this novel might be different from yours. Just remember, YOU ARE LOVED AND YOU WILL BE LOVED! Just be yourself. Don't try to change who you are. And if people don't like you for you, then its their loss. They are missing out an amazing friend!AND DON'T FORGET TO READ THIS BOOK!Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2708273-hilda,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 4 out of 5,"February 18, 2014",9 likes,0,"Dear friends,It’s hard to review a book that you love. Because you always want to do the book justice. Because you want your review to pass your personal standard. Because you want people to understand how much you love the book but you don’t want to gush too much. It’s hard to write a review for the book that you love, because you want to do it ‘right’. It’s kind of crazy that it took me several days just to write this review.If you need a summary, here it is: The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a story about a freshman named Charlie, and this guy Charlie is extremely naïve to the point of almost unbelievable. Later, he befriends two seniors who expose him to things in real world.This book is very quotable that I swear, I reblog different quote from The Perks of Being a Wallflower every week in my Tumblr blog. Just Google ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower quote’ and you can see dozens of typographies popping up. I think it's the way Charlie describes things around him. I love Charlie’s voice. Sometimes it’s very child-like, but other times it feels more mature than most people in his age. It’s honest, real, and relatable. It’s unlike anything you’ve ever encountered.I found little things that Charlie did to his friends are endearing. The way he gives gifts to everyone and doesn’t wish for anything in return. The way he makes mixtape for Patrick and picks winter as the theme. The way he wants to buy books for people he loves not because he wants to educate them, but because he wants them to read the book and fall in love with the story too. Charlie is, in a quirky and extraordinary way, adorable. As I've already said, sometimes Charlie can be child-like, but he is not childish. He grows up, and he learns about things. Charlie makes mistakes, and I can’t say that I agree with everything he does, but he is still one of my favorite fictional characters ever.I love The Perks of Being a Wallflower because it makes me see things from different perspective. And because I love Charlie, and all the other characters in this book. Because they feel real. As if I can touch, have conversations with them when I read the book.This book might not be for everyone, and there are scenes like drinking, smoking pot, or sexual scenes that I don’t want to expose to youngsters. But if you’re ever in the mood of something short, beautiful, and special, something that will make you think… please pick this book.And all the books you've read have been read by other people. And all the songs you've loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that's pretty to you is pretty to other people. And you know that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing ""unity.""It's like when you are excited about a girl and you see a couple holding hands, and you feel so happy for them. And other times you see the same couple, and they make you so mad. And all you want is to always feel happy for them because you know that if you do, then it means that you're happy, too.Love always,HildaRead other reviews in my blog! :)

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Rating 5 out of 5,"July 8, 2024",9 likes,0,"I read this book because my teenage children read and loved it. It’s a great book. I know that it has been challenged many times and made unavailable at certain schools, but I think hiding this kind of story is really just burying your head in the sand. The things touched upon happen every day. To people we know. To people our children know. Sometimes, even to our children.Having the book take epistolary form, especially in Charlie’s voice, was a wise choice. We know right from page one that there is something not quite right with Charlie. He is 15, about to become a freshman, and yet has the voice of an 8-10 year, a naïve 8-10 year old at that. His simple and direct approach to writing his letters allows the reader to take a step back from what they are reading. It removes some of the shock and allows Charlie to make a simple statement that implies rape, or something equally horrible, without going into detail or giving us any more information than Charlie is willing to provide.When Charlie writes about masturbation it doesn't seem dirty or offensive because he is just telling it like it is. He uses simple words and it is very obvious to the reader that he isn't writing about it to shock or titillate us. He’s sharing information. Even having Charlie write to an unknown/unnamed “safe” person is genius. It doesn't matter who he is writing to, but the fact that Charlie can be open and honest without concern for being judged makes the dialogue more meaningful. Whoever he is writing to has no way to respond which also frees Charlie’s possible inhibitions.The reasons I just listed for liking the book are also the reasons I found a bit of fault. I think that when you write a book geared toward young adults you have a certain responsibility. The subjects of molestation, drug abuse, rape and any number of other very serious issues are simply touched upon. Many of the instances are never fully addressed or dealt with. Charlie simply relays the facts. Even Charlie’s personality is a bit of an issue for me. I know we don’t really need to know exactly what’s up with Charlie’s mental faculties, but neither do we want to give young readers the idea that mentally immature, possibly autistic kids are just accepted. Charlie is allowed to come and go as he pleases with very little supervision from his parents, he is allowed to drive and even smokes, drinks and does drugs without his parents becoming suspicious. Chbosky’s portrayal of Charlie’s parents made them seem effective parents with the exception that I felt a mentally deficient or unbalanced kid should not have had that much freedom!Laying aside all my complaints I enjoyed the hell out of this book. I don’t find Charlie or his friends realistic, but I liked them. They had real issues and seemed to genuinely care about each other. Charlie’s family was a normal, nice family and I did find his interactions with his siblings to be sweet. I enjoyed reading about his experiences with his outer family as well. Charlie’s family sounds like everyone’s. They were a bunch of people with a few wackadoos, drunks and grouches thrown in. We all know what that is like even if we don’t want to admit it.The movie removed a few of my objections. In the movie Charlie is portrayed as quiet, but normal. The movie was lovely and I would encourage anyone to see it. With a teenager if you can.Show more"

I think I first saw a mention of it on Tumblr where I chanced upon one of the many wonderful quotes in the book. A movie was made. And somewhere while turning the pages of this book, watching the movie and reading quotes from the book, many wallflowers identified with Charlie, the protagonist of the novel. The following is a representation of my first and only letter to Charlie. May 2, 2014Dear Charlie,I hope you won’t mind me writing to you. At times like these, when it feels like I have no one else to talk to, I feel like I have you. You seem like the only person who would understand. I read all your letters. I did not know then, why you thought I was the only one who would understand. Now I do. While reading your letters and waiting for your next one, somewhere I found myself. I didn’t know what an exhilarating feeling it was, never knowing someone personally and yet knowing so much about them. Thank you for showing me that. I know exactly how you felt when you told me you were a wallflower because I’m one too. What I’m saying is, you’ll never know how big a change you made in my life when you decided to make me a part of yours. Thank you for introducing me to your friends. I hope Patrick finds someone who understands all of him and not just be with him because it’s convenient. I hope he finds the happiness he found when he played Frank ‘Not Furter for the very last time. I hope you and Sam work things out and I hope you will let her love you. You taught me that ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". At this point I’m sure you will argue that it was your English teacher, Bill who is to be credited, but Bill didn’t write me those letters, did he? I hope you will take these words into consideration. Accept her love. Because I really think you deserve it, even if you disagree. Thank you for exposing me to so many beautiful books and songs and for not making such a big deal out of it. You showed me that it’s okay to feel angry, sad, disappointed, happy and have no reason for it. You made me realise the importance of reading good books and being among good people. Thank you for doing all these great things for me. You wouldn’t know what an impact your letters have had on my life. Thank you for keeping me company. Thank you for the letters. I honestly think I am the better for it. I keep re-reading the last letter you wrote. There’s still hope that you’d write to me again but I think it’s better if you “participate” in the things happening in your life. I hope things worked out well for you and you’re finally happy. I hope there will be a day when you can be honest about your feelings with the people you love and who love you back. I hope you can be who you really are and do what you really want to do and not what people expect you to do.I believe that things are good with you and even if they are not, they will be soon enough. I hope you will believe the same about me. And most importantly, thank you for showing me that the perfect song on the perfect drive, with the most perfect people, is enough to make one feel infinite.Love always, Your friend. Show more"

So I hope no one hates me for this, but I finished The Perks of Being a Wallflower...and I hated it. There, I said it. This was probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I'm not going to lie, I wanted to read it for the hype and the movie coming out. But at this point, I will not even watch the movie.I ended up reading parts of the book aloud to my husband to see if it was just me. I wish I could have taken a picture of his face during some of the scenes-priceless.Why did I have issues with the book?*Well it starts that he is a 15 year old who is writing anonymous letters to some person he never met but just heard she was a good listener? How did he get her address? And he wrote to her for a little over a year, or close to it? *He is pouring out his heart and soul to this anonymous person but he is too scared to use any real names, places, etc just in case she puts 2 and 2 together and discovers who he is? *Charlie is 15 years old and he doesn't know what masturbation is and/or assumes someone who is older than him doesn't know what it is? Then explains to her what it is...And he tells her about masturbation and having masturbation breaks at work instead of coffee breaks just to be cute? What?! ""I'm only trying to be cute here. I don't really mean it. I just wanted to make you smile. I meant the ""wow"" though."" (The ""wow"" statement being more of a trick to being cute.) This seriously pissed me off. Not that he either didn't know about it or whatever. But he started talking about it to a female stranger. I almost stopped the book here. *How naive/sheltered do you have to be to not know when someone is being raped? My disgust was so huge at this point that I almost stopped reading. He knew enough to later ask ""He raped that girl didn't he?"" He helped that asshole rape the girl in my opinion because he didn't try to stop it or get help. He just sat there and covered his ears!*Charlie did not appear to be any 15 year old I've ever encountered. Just the amount of crying makes me curious about him-is there something a bit more serious going on than just needing a shrink? Why doesn't his family realize this?So with all my dislike for the book, there is one thing that I did appreciate. Through the course of the book we see Charlie's mental decline. He is not doing so well and needs help-and by the end of the book he gets it. And I had to keep telling myself 'This is 1991/2 Ginny.'And I guess kudos for trying to include every single teen issue in one book. Drugs, sex, alcohol, teen pregnancy, rape, suicide, abortion, masturbation, molestation, homophobia, being gay, um what else..oh physical abuse. Yeah, I think that was all of them. Unfortunately it was not executed very well. In fact, seemed far fetched and almost forced.Would I recommend this train wreck to anyone? No. I honestly have not disliked a book so much. I do not see any 'coming of age' or anything special about the book. Even the format was not special to me!Ugh, on the bright side, at least I can say I've read the book now. That's the only perk of the book.Show more"

"" 26 април, 1992 Скъпи приятелю,[...] Знам, че сам си навлякох всичко това. Знам, че го заслужавам. Бих дал всичко, за да не съм такъв. Бих дал всичко, за да оправя нещата за всички. За да не трябва да ходя на психиатър, който да ми обяснява, че съм бил „пасивно агресивен“. За да не трябва да пия лекарството, което ми предписва, защото е твърде скъпо за татко. За да не трябва да му разказвам лошите си спомени. И за да не изпитвам носталгия за лоши неща. Просто искам Бог, или нашите, или Сам, или сестра ми, или някой друг просто да ми обясни какво ми има. Да ми каже как да се променя, но по някакъв смислен начин. И да сложа край на всичко това. Веднъж завинаги. Знам, че това не е правилно, защото аз съм отговорен за всичко, знам също, че нещата се влошават, преди да се подобрят, поне така казва психиатърът ми, но този път се влошиха прекалено много. След като не бях говорил с никого цяла седмица, накрая се обадих на Боб. Знам, че не беше редно, но не се сещах как да постъпя. Попитах го има ли нещо, което да купя. Каза, че са му останали четири грама трева. Купих ги с част от парите си за Великден. И оттогава пуша непрекъснато. [...] 29 април, 1992Иска ми се да напиша, че положението се е пооправило, но не е така. И хич не е лесно, особено поради това, че пак тръгнах на училище, а не мога да ходя по местата, с които бях свикнал. Нищо няма да бъде както преди. А аз още не бях готов за тази раздяла. Да ти призная, избягвам всичко. Вървя по коридорите в училище и разглеждам останалите. Гледам учителите и се чудя защо са тук. И дали харесват професията си, а и нас. Питам се умни ли са били на петнайсет. Не заядливо – просто ми е любопитно. Разглеждам и учениците и се чудя на кой в този ден са му разбили сърцето и как се справя с това плюс трите контролни и есето за някоя книга. Замислям се също кой го е разбил. И защо. Особено ако учеха в друго училище, онези с разбитото сърце щяха да го дължат на съвсем различен човек… Защо тогава всичко трябва да се приема толкова лично?[...]23 август, 1992Главната причина да плача обаче беше, че изведнъж осъзнах, че съм тук, нося се през тунела, вятърът брули лицето ми и не ми пука дали ще видя града. И дори не мисля за него. Просто се нося. И съм тук, истински. И това ми беше достатъчно, за да се почувствам безкраен. Утре започвам девети клас. И ако щеш вярвай, изобщо не ме е страх да ида на училище. Не знам ще имам ли време да ти пиша повече писма, защото може да съм твърде зает да „се включа“. Така че, ако това наистина се окаже последното ми писмо, моля те, повярвай, че с мен всичко е наред, а дори и да не е, скоро ще се оправи. И аз вярвам същото за теб.Вечно твой, Чарли "" Show more"

Charlie, our main character (can't really call him a protagonist since there isn't a central conflict/villian) definitely writes and acts a lot younger than his age (which is 15). When you reach the end of the book you find out that he is  molested by his Aunt Helen when he was younger . I truly think that is the reason as for why Charlie acts the way he does.I recently saw my new favorite movie ever, Mysterious Skin, which was about two kids named Neil and Brian, who were both sexually molested by their baseball coach when they were eight. Neil thought the abuse was normal, and was an initiation into homosexuality, since he already thought he was gay, so he becomes a prostitute. Brian not only surpresses what happened and doesn't remember it, he wets his bed, he gets bloody noses, doesn't like to be touched sexually. My point in bringing up that brilliant movie is that  sexual abuse  affects people in so many ways. I believe that what happened to Charlie when he was younger has trapped his mind in a sort of innocent seven year old mind. What I mean by that is not that he's mentally delayed or whatever, since he is clearly a smart kid. I mean that he doesn't have emotional maturity of a 15 year old kid. The end shows he's not comfortable with  having sex with Sam, even though he loves her . Some have wondered why his mind is so immature, yet these other kids don't notice and befriend him. I have two possible answers. The first being that they didn't notice he was clearly not as mature as them (that is probably unlikely though). The second one is this.Why don't we notice pedophiles are different than other people? They have a sick, disgusting mind. Why don't we notice serial killers from other people? Their mind is sick. These people can integrate themselves into normal society, but  their mind  is what's the problem. Maybe how Charlie acted on the inside wasn't entirely what he was like on the outside. Yes, Charlie cried a lot. Maybe they assumed he was sensitive. So, I'm not at all dismissing what other people have said about Charlie. You have a right to feel/say whatever it is you feel/said about him. I'm simply putting in my own piece of what I felt about his character. Show more"

Reading this book, I felt a lot of things. I actually shed tears for a couple of times. This book felt so sad and hopeful at the same time. I know a lot of people already read this and I am quite late for discovering how wonderful this is but I am just so glad I got the chance to read this. I know the feeling of always being inside my head. Being there but not really being there. Letting yourself be swallowed by your own mind can really make real damage. That is why I actually cried because at some tiny points, I can really relate myself to Charlie.This book deals with a lot of issues and reading this makes you want to wish not only Charlie, but to everyone out there who are experiencing this, to please hold on and never let go. To hope that they find a way, any way, to make it. The matters discussed got real dark but I loved that it never forgets to show the hopeful side of things.

Supposedly, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is kicking out The Catcher in the Rye in some high-schools, since it's 'the contemporary version.' What do I have to say on that?Simply a no. Yes, it's a fine book--nothing wrong with that. Yes, it's certainly a fast and enjoyable read. And yes, I could understand how it follows in the footsteps of The Catcher in the Rye...but in no way could it take it's place. The Catcher in the Rye is something every person should read, especially in their teenage years, and it's something every person can connect to in their own way--J.D. Salinger did a perfect job, his writing was beautiful, his character was real, and his story was lovable. I sat for hours and hours after reading that book and just cried, a happy, glad sort of crying, but a heavy sort too...With this book, I finished it, set it down, and felt nothing. I still, thinking over it, feel nothing but sheer indifference. I'd rather hate or love a book than just feel indifferent towards it. I also couldn't care for the main character--Charlie. He was supposed to be quiet, thoughtful, serious, and intelligent, and yet I couldn't make myself like him, or even care about what could ever happen to him. He got wonderful grades, had older friends, went to parties, blah blah blah...At fourteen, none of that was ever done--I was failing, I hated my friends, and parties were the least of my problems.

I started this book without knowing too much about it, except that the main character was called Charlie and that he was a teenage boy. Charlie is a freshman who overthinks and over analyzes everything. One day he becomes friend with Sam and her brother Patrick. This changes totally his life.Charlie is a peculiar teen. He analyzes everything with a distant coldness. He is more a spectator of his own life than an actor. But I think everyone of us felt like him at least once in our life. The heavy feeling that you don't belong with your friends, that you're numbly watching passing your life in front of your very eyes.The way the story is told, through letters to an unknown ""good man"" is great and original. I really like it. I would have liked to know who that mysterious good man was. Maybe there were hints, and I didn't get them ?But despite the story being told in first person, I felt disconnected. Which means it was harder for me to get into the story. It doesn't mean I didn't like it, not at all. It's just that I really like to feel like I'm surrounded by the book's universe and not just watching it from above.The ending really shocked me, I wasn't expecting something of that kind. Not at all.Characters : - I talked a lot about Charlie so I will just add this : he is doing his best not to disappoint his new friends.- Sam is Charlie's crush, she is a loyal friend. She blames Charlie for doing things the wrong way, but sometimes she isn't clear herself.- Patrick seems like a rock, the tough one. But he is also fragile and has to deal with his pain. To be honest I didn't like the way he used Charlie. He sees him when he needed a friend, a shoulder to lean on but when everything was alright he tended to forget him.Overall I really enjoyed this book.

I would stop comparing because movies was pretty good and i am still high from they book so it is looking bleak in contrast.The narrator of the book is teenager, and the writer did not evn took the time of the day to describe the way charlie looks because he does not have to. The feelings and situation speak for themselves. The book is written the way a teen would look at the world. He would see the highlights like long hair, pretty girls, jocks etc. But Charlie saw other things like when people did not want to smile, like when they were content and when they were pretending.  I am really interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other and does not like each other. The book is about coming to understand who we are and where we come from. And who we want to be. Who want to be is one thing that puts the rest in perspective.  Not everyone has a sob story and even if they do its not an excuse. Most of all about learning to appreciate the love and people and friends around us. Trying to participate and how much important it is say things at times. Regardless of them being harsh, sweet, cheesy, unpleasant they need to be said and said in the most right way as possible.And my favorite line from the book Charlie, we accept the love we think we deserve.""

In this case, I made a little bit of an oopsie and watched the film adaptation before getting around to the book.I am aware that The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a very beloved book for a large amount of people, so I'd be lying if I said I didn't expect to love it.I honestly think that watching the film ruined this book a little bit for me. I actually quite liked the film, so going into this, my expectations were nothing but high.With that being said, right off the bat I noticed that the writing style really wasn't for me, we got nearly no character development from half of the people I read about, but having seen the movie, I was able to look past that issue temporarily. Through the entirety of this novel, Charlie is writing letters to a 'friend'. The concept was great, I'll give it that much, but the overall narration seemed like it was missing something I can't exactly pinpoint. In addition, I really didn't like the way that mental health was represented in this book. There were a ton of powerful topics stuffed into this short novel. Rape, suicide, depression, abuse, drugs etc, and not one of them was looked at in any sort of depth. It honestly pains me to say that I think the film did a slightly better job of representing some of these topics.In my opinion, I think that this book had a ton of potential, but fell short in the end.Show more"

This book was like nothing I've read before, but definitely in a good way. I loved the author's style, how the whole story was told through Charlie's letters to a person he's never even met before. Charlie's letters and personality remind of The Catcher In the Rye a lot, but I'd have to say I liked this one a whole lot better. The Perks of Being a Wallflower deals with so many issues, starting off with a suicide and moving on to drugs, drinking, sex, and just figuring out who you are. I felt myself loving Charlie and wanting him to make it out of everything okay. He was so naive and adorable that he's that kid that's impossible not to like. I love the other characters too, like Sam, Patrick, and even Mary Elizabeth. Everyone was so quirky and accepted you for who you were with no questions. I really can't find one thing I did't like about this book. After finishing this (I borrowed it from a friend), I had to talk to her like five different times that same night because I couldn't wrap my mind around what happened. There was just a feeling of, I don't know...I really just don't know. This book really makes you think but not really know what to think at the same time. It's really quick, so if you have the chance, you should definitely pick this up. I think it's something everyone should experience and I really can't wait for the movie.

The hype is unreal which made me super nervous to read it. Add in that it is told in an epistolary manner, which can be very hit or miss for me, and I had no idea how I'd feel about this book.I went into this more or less blind and was pleased to find a book about friendship, coping at school when you know no-one and also about books and writing. However, it was so much more than that, so many deeper meanings and subjects were covered and although I didn't adore it as much as many others I do feel like this book kind of floored me with how deep it was and that I don't think I'll forget it, or the writing which I loved. This book is so 90's, with smoking in restaurants, cinemas and on one occasion actually in school. There's lots of drinking and drugs in this but it kind of pieces together friendship circles and makes them all share and become closer.I did have a few moments that I had slight issues with. Well maybe not issues, just bits I didn't enjoy as much as others, and hence this book is only a 4 star read for me but I can't wait to check out the film soon.--watched the film and it's made me love the story even more.

I watched the movie ages ago, and then watched it again like two or three times last year (didn't plan it, I just happened to be there when someone else was watching it on TV), so nothing could take me by surprise. Perhaps I thought I would get bored reading the book (especially when I found out it was an epistolary) but, obviously, it didn't happen.Both the movie and the book left me a mess (good job writer/director Chbosky!), they gave me a sense of connection with Charlie's world... it was like he was my little brother. I experienced a sense of protection toward him every time he was upset about anything, because I could feel all those things Charlie felt too. His kindness, his relationships with his sister, parents, Patrick, Sam made my heart melt so much.

No sabía que era un libro, y cuando me enteré no sentí la necesidad de leerlo porque simplemente la película me había dejado satisfecha. Pero como me encontraba en la librería, y me estaba haciendo ojitos... decidí leer al menos unas cuantas páginas a ver qué tal. De una sentada leí 68 páginas y ni hablar, lo compré y fue la mejor decisión que pude haber tomado.Me encantó leer desde el punto de vista de Charlie. Es un personaje fantástico, adorable pero con defectos, y el hecho de que el libro esté escrito en formato de cartas le dio un buen toque. Sentí en verdad que Charlie me estaba hablando a mí directamente.Los otros personajes también me parecieron muy bien construidos, muy reales. Me podía identificar con ellos incluso cuando cometían errores, y eso es lo que siempre busco en los personajes de las historias.Las ventajas de ser un marginado nos cuenta un año en la vida de Charlie, un adolescente común y corriente, así que no hay emociones fuertes ni dramas que no se puedan encontrar en cualquier otra novela. Sin embargo, no me importaría seguir leyendo dos, tres y hasta cuatro libros más de este personaje. Me identifiqué muchísimo con él, reí, lloré y me enojé con él.Sin lugar a dudas una excelente lectura.Show more"

That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning. If this gets any worse, I might have to go back to the doctor. It’s getting that bad again.” ❤️ This book kept me at the edge of my seat and made me feel so many things at once.Stephen Chbosky manages to touch on sensitive subjects such as suicide, death and depression while also remaining realistic. It makes the reader feel vulnerable and really takes them on an emotional rollercoaster. The writing style really appealed to me because of its format and simplicity. We, readers, get to read the letters our main character Charlie writes to someone he calls “Friend”. Because of this, we view all the characters the way Charlie perceives them: it makes us wary. The book is very easy to follow, because it is intentionally written in a simple way. We follow the thoughts of our main character while he struggles with high school, friends and life in general.I can recommend this book to every young adult out there. This book is a beautiful coming of age story that impacts you in a way you could never imagine. It makes you view life in a different perspective and changes you as a person. I am glad I had to read this book for English and this definetly has become a book I will look back to and say “This book is life-changing.”Show more"

And I’d have to thank the movie for making me appreciate this book — yes, the movie may be slightly better than the book. But the book is beautiful as well. The atmosphere was perfect for this story, and I really liked the choice to tell Charlie’s story through a series of letters. (Personally, I’ve yet to think of a theory about who the letters were addressed to). I applaud Chobasky for how well the narration of the story was: it was so raw and perfectly put Charlie’s experiences (especially with mental health) into words. Charlie’s story may not reflect the experience of every teenager, but I’m sure every reader will relate to a part of Charlie. He was so lovable that I couldn’t help but sympathize with him even when he made terrible decisions. And the side characters were amazing too. I fell so in love with Sam and Patrick and Mary Elizabeth that I missed them after the book was over. Although I appreciate the book (as you can see from my fangirling), it ultimately fell flat for me. I felt that there were too many issues and topics crammed into such a small book and timeline that some things felt like they were glossed over and lost the emotional impact. Despite my criticism, I can never separate my nostalgia and the book. And I do recommend everyone to at least give the book a chance!Show more"

This book is so deep.2. Closeted gay guy+guy who has never kissed anyone+smart girl is the best coming of age friend groupI didn't think I would like this book at first cause it's 22 years old. And it is still up to today's world. Okay maybe we don't make musictapes as gifts but the things about drugs, ciggarets and drugs are really up to date.The characters:Charlie was such an innocent boy. And then he started high school. I was like 100% sure that he figures out he's gay or bi after he gets kissed by a boy. (no spoilers lol)I really liked Sam. Her character really spoke to me and she is a smart woman. SHE EVEN STANDS UP FOR WOMAN RIGHTS. She told Charlie what he needs to do and how to fit it. I want a friend like that.Patrick. Patty. Nothing. He is like a geniunly nice guy. Nothing really special was about him. I mean yeah he was gay but he didn't make that his whole personality. Conclusion: good friend, sometimes drunk.I hated Mary Elizabeth. Her style seemed cool and all but her personality was a no. Okay I get that Charlie liked being in a relationship but she was just annoying to me. Her only talking and him just being there not even listening is not a relationship you should be in.I shouldn't talk about the whole plot and ending cause I don't wanna spoil it. BUT YOZ SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. It talks about real problems that are still happening in the world. And the struggles of a high schooler.Show more"

I can’t find the perfect words to describe this masterpiece. I can’t even find the perfect words to describe what I’ve just read. I’m speechless. This was amazing. I love the characters a lot. Charlie, my poor 15 year old beb, my love for you is infinite and I honestly can’t believe that I care about you that much. He’s one of my comfort characters rn huh. Also, Sam. I LOVE HER. I LOVE HER WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND I WOULD LITERALLY SELL MY SOUL TO SEE HER HAPPY. She deserves everything she wants. I’m still not over the fact that Sam kissed Charlie just because she wanted Charlie to “have his first kiss with someone who actually loves him”. This is too much for me. I can talk about this book for hours but I won’t because it will be useless. Everybody knows that this novel is a big “YES” for everyone, no matter what. But bringing up the things that I didn’t like, let’s start with the fact that the action happens in 1991-1992 and people were kinda… close minded at that time. Like seriously, Charlie said that Brad took “the role of the girl” when him and Patrick had sex. Also, all the lines about sex made me really uncomfy but Charlie was uncomfortable too so practically that was the point… I guess??

Typically, I've liked the books my students have suggested or at least enjoyed them as some guilty pleasure reading (case in point: Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). However, this novel, as it seems to want to be more than it really is, was not enjoyable for me. I did find the narrator both endearing and empathetic, but as is the case in the teenage life, the issues of the novel seemed to overwhelm it (and there were many: suicide, molestation, sex-both heterosexual and homosexual, drug use, alcohol and tobacco abuse, physical abuse, abortion, and I could go on). In a way I worried that it glorified all the horrific events of life (much in the same way that our media does with natural disasters and car wrecks). So...it's only redeeming grace for me was found in the fact that the English teacher who took an interest in the narrator, did NOT turn out to be a sexual deviant (as I feared throughout the entire novel, given its nature). Thank God for that one bit of grace, eh?Show more"

Charlie is such a sensitive, awe worthy sweetheart, and reminds me a lot of who I was at one point in my life; sad, anxious, uncertain. I love the writing used in this book, and the characters; I really did love the people in this book! Charlie, Sam, Patrick, Charlie's sister, all their friends, etc. This book addresses so many issues that really can hit almost everyone; depression, anxiety, developing new friendships, attempting to communicate with family, sexual abuse, physical abuse, etc. It's a book I believe I will always always remember. it makes you remember that life is not always so easy for some people, and the fact that lil precious Charlie narrated this book it just makes my heart heavy because of all the hardship connected to him -- fictional or not.Show more"

Love always,NMMI so wanted to hate this book, but couldn't and it have just forced me to give 5 stars. Awesome storyline, facts rumbling and well structured letters. Have finished a book with a perfect ending after so many days. Though it bothers me a lot because of Charlie's being a crying baby all over the time. But anybody will like Charlie as he is so much into struggle to fit in the high school and with others and with his innocence. Charlie seems to be so much generous and sometimes too caring and straightforward in the same conditions. The best part is that I can relate myself so many times with Charlie. Like him I am also pretending to like things that I actually don't and I always want to be someone in the crowd still trying hard to make an identity of my own and that makes so easy for me liking this book. Charlie is annoying of course for his immature behavior in some cases, but still I find him real in our society so it's a welll read for me. Show more"

I didn't notice that the first time around.The last chapter still hits, after all these years.The thing about this book is that it's an epistolary novel that actually makes you feel like you are the recipient of the letters. And you form a connection to Charlie and you feel like he is your friend. The reader - character bond is great here. Charlie is such a sweet character.The other characters, even though some of them are not developed as much as the main character, that's due to the fact that we see what Charlie sees, felt very real. The issues are serious and there is a wide array of topics discussed here that made me feel like it is very true to real life. Although not all of them are discussed in detail, then again we have only Charlie's POV, maybe outside of his observations, the characters talked about it.This book may not appeal to everybody but for some of us that like Catcher in the Rye but with a far more likable main character, this book was very good.------------------I Still love this.

Wonderful. There is a big cast of characters and observations of them from Charlie's point of view. His feelings are believable and sometimes sucker punch you when something unexpected happens. He will break your heart with how he is coping or, perhaps, not coping, with the things in his life. Charlie is somewhat alienated from everyone because he has experienced some rough things, some of which he has yet to share with anyone. But even with all going on in his head, he manages to find a few true friends and then make some mistakes and try to learn and continue on. You will feel for Charlie and Sam and Patrick.The movie of this is actually written by the book's author and one of the few times when I think the movie mirrors the book almost completely. I'm not sure whether or not I like the movie or book better in this case.My only tiny quibble is I'd have liked to know to whom he actually sent the letters so half a star off for that.Show more"

For my own personal enjoyment - a 4. This was a wonderful YA novel and I can see why my students LOVE this book and recommended it. I've heard about it for ages and finally put it on my summer reading list and I was certainly glad I did. Charlie reminded me of many of my own students - the ""wallflowers"". What I took from this book was really the message of how important families are, because I am afraid to think what would become of Charlie had he not had a loving family. I often wonder the same about my own students - the ones you can see something is wrong yet they always say, ""I'm fine."" I thought the author painted the family flawed - which was perfect, because it was REAL. I thought it was so dead-on accurate in description. It wasn't exactly a cheerful book (no spoilers), but it woke me up a bit as a teacher, to really see what's behind those straight A's, but sometimes ""odd"" behavior. Wonderful read.Show more"

Because it kind of seems like Charlie just keeps ""rambling"" about his life. But he really isn't and that's what makes this whole story so nice. Yes, it's about a guy who has difficulties blending in but Charlie is different. In a good way. And I love how he slowly discovers what friendship, love, honesty, pain etc. is. He faces things what everyone at some point in their life did. So Charlie isn't just rambling about life, he invites us in his life as a neutral observer and while he tells us about what is going on, he discovers something about himself, his past, and that's the whole point of the story. It was hidden between every phrase. And when I finished the book, I actually felt like crying because Charlie became this amazing, strong and understanding guy and he's alright. He's doing fine. And you will, too. That's what he said. Then I had to cry. I have no idea why I'm still talking. :D Show more"

Pick it up, dust it off and see an angle I missed before.I was instantly hooked on all of the characters. I could visualize them and feel their presence like they were standing right next to me. I loved seeing things through the eyes of the main character but also could easily see how his view was skewed from the norm. (Not that I see the world from a normal viewpoint either.)

That awkward unsure days where all you care about is being cool and having friends.

Charlie is socially awkward and totally endearing. Extremely intelligent but naive, you kind of want to take him under your wing. had I not have known that Charlie was 15 I would assume I was reading the letters of a 12 year old child, he came across younger than the age stated in the book. Charlie’s preference to observe people rather than participate makes him a wallflower. Filled with sex, relationships, friendship, drugs, pregnancy, rape, death and grief. Charlie’s story touches on many teenage issues and more. Upsetting and heartwarming all rolled into one. 4 stars from me. ✨ Show more"

Jamás había leído este tipo de narrativa y me resultó bastante entretenida, te atrapa desde el primer instante y se convierte en algo súper rápido de leer, tiene frases destacables y canciones hermosas. Sin embargo, me costó sentirme parte de la historia, comprender y empatizar todo lo que sucedía. Tardé hasta más de la mitad de mi lectura en encontrar un objetivo o problemática central, pasaban más cosas, pero se les daba un cierre. Me hubiera gustado leerlo en otra etapa de mi vida, donde quizá podría haberme servido. No obstante, lo que terminó de convencerme fue el final, realmente esperaba algo diferente y eso cambió mi perspectiva de lo que ya había leído, vi la película para completar y concluir con la experiencia y puedo decir firmemente que lo recomiendo.Show more"

The writing is surprisingly straightforward yet very deep and touching. It's a beautiful coming of age story told through the letters of our main character Charlie. His character is so innocent and genuine, vulnerable and relatable and it's a joy reading the letters from his very observant point of view.I loved every second of reading this book and it was just such a great reading experience!(I highly recommend listening to the movie soundtrack while reading this!)Show more"

Objectively, this isn’t the greatest book in the world. The diary format misses a lot of the time, and everything about it worked so much better (and was much more impactful) in the movie. But the story and it’s characters have, and always will, mean a lot to me, so it’s getting a higher rating than it probably deserves. Fight me.Reread, 3.5/5.Show more"

Yet, multiple hints and descriptions of PTSD symptoms were smoothly yet accurately depicted, making this book an all-time favorite.Show more"

Una trama que hemos visto en múltiples libros..... ahora lo maravilloso de este libro esta en que : Primero; la historia nos las cuenta siempre Charlie a través de cartas que manda a un amigo anónimo ; Segundo; es un libro real, en ningún momento exagera lo que es estar en la secundaria o lo dificil que es hacer amigos y mas cuando te cuesta socializar y tercero y para mi los mas importante : la forma tan hermosa y real en que trata temas como abuso sexual, aborto , LGBT, la salud mental y la amistad: muchísimos libros tratan estos temas por encima o sin importancia y aquí abordamos todos ellos sin restarle importancia a ninguno en especial para mi a la salud mental, Charlie es un chico con varias enfermedades mentales como ansiedad, depresión y PTSD y aunque el mismo no sabe que esta lidiando con estas enfermedades si las vemos presentes durante todo el libro y es una montaña rusa de emociones y mas cuando sufres de estas mismas enfermedades y es por eso que este libro es mi favorito porque cuando lo leí por primera vez en el 2014/2015 estaba sufriendo la depresión mas horrible de mi vida pero no sabia eso en esos momentos que era, sencillamente sabia que estaba mal y que algo malo me pasaba.... y cuando leí este libro me vi a mi misma en los zapatos de Charlie, nunca en mi vida me he sentido tan identificada con un personaje como me siento con Charlie, no solo por los temas de salud mental si no también por su forma de ser, toda la vida me ha costado hacer amigos, era la callada y nerd del salón, recuerdo salir a la hora de descanso y preferir pasar mi tiempo con los libros pero también en lo tan importante que para mi es la familia y mis amigos y que los poco que tengo los amo con toda mi alma, ahora después de la relectura ya no me identifico al 100% con Charlie pero si en su mayor parte por eso sigue siendo uno de mis personajes favoritos y con el cual me siento identificada, ahora el final de este libro es de mis favoritos, no quiero decir mucho porque es hermoso y a la vez impactante cuando llegas a las ultimas 20 paginas pero sencillamente las dos ultimas dos paginas de este libro son : Infinitas. ✨✨Romance/Amistad ✨Mas que romance ( que si tiene pero realmente muy mínimo) este libro habla mas sobre la importancia de tener un pequeño grupo de amigos, así sea solo uno y mas cuando sufres de enfermedades mentales ( y aunque no fuera así igual), amo, AMO la amista de Charlie, Patrick y Sam, amo como ellos incluyen a Charlie en su grupo de amigos y siempre están ahí para el, nunca lo juzgan o tratan diferente a pesar de que es el es tímido y callado y ellos son extrovertidos, de como están para Charlie durante este año y como lo ayudan también a ser parte de algo, amamos la amistad y entre el romance y la amistad me quedo con esta ultima. ✨✨Personajes✨Todos son una maravilla, Charlie te amo con todo mi corazon, hubo ciertas cosas que hiciste que estuvieron mal pero entiendo el porque las hiciste. Sam y Patrick tienen todo mi corazon, amo su forma de ser, su hermandad, su amor por Charlie y como lo ayudan a salir de ese cascarón. Patrick eres de los personajes que mas amo, tu forma de ser mi King. Y mención honorifica al profesor de literatura de Charlie, como hubiera deseado tener un profesor a si en mi vida. ✨✨En conclusión, para mi el mejor libro en cuanto a adolescencia y temas mentales, con personajes reales con situaciones fuertes manejadas de una forma maravillosa, con personajes con los cuales te identificas y con un final hermoso y a la vez agridulce. ✨5.0 ✨✨Show more"
