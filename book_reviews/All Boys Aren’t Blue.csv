This is a lovely and wonderful memoir that I think would be perfect for LGBT+ teens and allies who are seeking to learn more about gender identity, toxic masculinity, and themselves. Johnson puts himself in the place of a mentor and friend who's looking out for others (and directly talks to you, the reader) who have been in vulnerable places like him. He shares anecdotes from his life growing up and turns them into accessible lessons for his audience. Johnson seems like such a caring and compassionate person, who holds so much love for his family and the support network he has, and I could truly feel it in his writing and audiobook narration.My caveat is more of a personal preference, but I wish he had done more showing instead of telling in his writing. When he shares anecdotes throughout his life, he also goes out of his way to explain what the story symbolized, which becomes overt and repetitive. I would have liked for him to take a step back and let us process and immerse ourselves in his stories as they are, rather than explaining directly to the reader, especially when the messages can be quite obvious without any further demonstration. As a reader, I prefer the writing to push ideas in a more poetic way, rather than have it be directly told. I’m sure he really wanted to nail the messages down to a teenage audience though, so I don’t really mind and am willing to boost my rating to 5 stars because I still think this is a valuable book for young people in the LGBT+ community.Show more"

Let that sink in.Honestly though, this book was everything I hoped it would be: An exploration of gender, identity and sexuality. A guide for queer and especially queer, Black kids that shows them they're valued and wanted and powerful. A moving memoir - I cried so much and at this point I don't know whether I'm just a big softie or have an immense talent in always picking books that hit me hardest. I can recommend it to teenagers that have questions about sex, relationships, growing up queer, about growing up Black but also to parents that want to ensure their kid has an affirming and supportive environment. Actually, I want everyone to read this because you're missing out if you're not.Find more of my books on InstagramShow more"

Johnson writes with clarity and power about their experience growing as a Queer Black child in New Jersey, not knowing where they fit in and wishing, as they say themselves, that they had a book like this one to provide some guidance, or at least reassurance, that life would get better, and that there was a path to better acceptance and happiness. The book is structured in a series of short, sharply rendered personal essays, making this a quick and compelling read. Their autobiographical stories are at turns beautiful, sad, painful and joyful, much like life itself. And while this book will be so meaningful to many LGBTQIA+ youth, looking for understanding and representation in an often cruel world, it is also completely relatable to any young reader who has ever felt like they didn't belong, or weren't understood by family or peers. Highly recommended!Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127243807-a-aus,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 1 out of 5,"January 2, 2021",366 likes,6 comments,"I have been debating on whether I should leave a review of this book because as a Gay Black Man I understand the importance of representation and having anything that gives voice to the struggles faced while occupying multiple marginalized spaces. However, I also think for those putting out ""manifestos"" we must hold accountable truths. With that being said, here is my review.I felt this book was problematic on so many levels. Besides this book being poorly written (who edited this book), this author centers himself in everything. I can understand you might say ""well it's his memoir"", but let me explain.The book starts with his ""trauma"" of having his front teeth kicked out when he was 5 years old. One would think that he was gay bashed, but he wasn't. It was just that he got jumped. That's it. He conveniently forgets what the fight was about as he states he can't remember what was said, yet this is put in the book to almost read as though he was gay bashed at a young age and it was a reach of all reaches. He discusses his father being in the hospital (the day of his 21st bday party that he still went to); he has a chapter where he discusses ""name trauma"" trying to connect it to what trans people go through. But his story of ""trauma"" was when he discovered his real name was George and not Matthew...are you serious? People actually have name trauma and his isn't cutting it. And speaking of names, he allows people to call him whatever they want and even says ""it doesn't matter what they call you."" But it does George, it does. Also, in regards to name, the chapter where he talks about his transgender cousin Hope, he decides it appropriate to still type out her dead name and refer to her and her friends (also transgender) as the ""funniest things"" at the barbecue...things? Ok. And he didn't just stop at those stereotypes, when referring to Beyonce he called her ""sassy."" It should also be mentioned that he feels the reason why his memory of his cousin Hope is in black and white is because as queer brown people, our lives are rarely in black and white...give me a break. Man you are reaching.Speaking of words, did you know that he created the term ""Honey Child""? That was news to me because as I am older than the author and from Baltimore, honey child was used by so many people so the fact that he states he created gay language in New Jersey before he knew what it was was laughable at best. This is also coming from an author who gave Nina Simone credit for Strange Fruit. While her rendition was great, Billie Holiday's version is the one that the youth should know. Why is he trying to have history start in the 60's? Additionally, when he does present a chapter that was to highlight the conflict in history as it was (is) taught to us, a way to whitewash our own brown history, he uses undated quotes from Abraham Lincoln to counter the narrative of him being a hero to Black people. While I am not on the Abraham Lincoln bandwagon, I will blame the editors and publishing company for allowing this to happen. When you leave quotes undated, there is no way to get an accurate timeline of personal evolution. Are we to be known by our worst quotes and taken out of context? I am all for calling people out, but let's do it in a way that doesn't leave room for this type of scrutiny. Maybe I am asking too much as a reader, but this is just an example of little to no research or work done in this text. Furthermore, I don't know what Catholic High School starts a week after labor day, but have him tell it, his first day of his junior year was on September 11, 2001 (a Tuesday). How do I know? I just happened to be in college and 6 blocks away from the Towers when they were hit. It's beyond frustrating when people try to position themselves to connect with history in a way that wasn't real (but maybe I am wrong). And why even mention 9/11 when the chapter is about him crushing hard on a boy?His journey is surface level at best. Apparently he's trying hard to be ""masculine"" and it wasn't until he successfully became an Alpha (fraternity) and he reached the goal of masculine signifiers did he say that he could define masculinity on his own terms. Never once did he tell the youth to stop trying to follow the crowd. Too many effeminate queer brown males have died from suicide because of the bullying within the gay community. How often do we see ""no fats, no fems"" and now we have this guy who clearly seems to have been part of that crowd (sorry for assuming) not once declare how problematic his walk was. His letter to his brother basically reads ""thank you so much for your strength"" for him having a gay brother...what? Why are you apologizing and congratulating your brother for being your brother. We have to move beyond apologizing to others for our existence. As I said, the book lacked insight; depth; and any critical theory at all. It read as though he bought a prompt journal and each chapter was his answers to the prompts. This author seems like he's the type of person to go to a support group of gun violence survivors only to discuss how his paper cut connects him to them. But here's the real problem, he was given the platform to do this. When reading this book, he actually has a story worth being told (we all do), but I just don't get the sense that this author has even gone to therapy let alone reconciled his memories and the affects they truly had on him before he wrote this book. It is sad because we need more voices, more representation, but this was just not good. I am tired of people with a decent follower account given carte blanche to disrespect the writing community; those who are actually brilliant theorists, that can successfully connect experiences to philosophies that can get people to think.After reading all the reviews of this book, I am sure my review will be lost in the sea of praise and if it gets to the author, he will most likely look at it as me being mean and causing him trauma, but I would hope he could find some truth into what I am saying. I hope that that truth can lead him to produce better work. I don't think his voice shouldn't be heard, but I do think he needs to sit with these things for a bit before presenting them to young adults. Maybe the themes presented will lead you to talk to your children. Maybe they will lead you to do self reflection. His goal was to get you to use him as a guide, so I pray that people can use this as a jumping off point and actually educate themselves. For this book to be for the youth and discussing Black queerness there was no mention of James Baldwin, Bayard Rustin, Audre Lorde, Langston Hughes, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey...all famous black queer people of our past. Ok, I am off my soapbox now. I host a book club and this was our book for December. At the end of each book we are tasked to give this a grade; the grades given were: D, F, I, F-, F- That sums it up for me.Show more"

All Boy's Aren't Blue is Johnson's memoir-manifesto; designed to encourage queer black boys to uncrate the layers of their masculinity and racialized existence. All Boys Aren't Blue is an effervescent interrogation of compulsory heterosexuality and crushing gender-centric expectations, a kaleidoscope of intergenerational storytelling, and cultural connectedness. All Boys Aren't Blue is a testimony, a love letter, to black queer bodies and officially one of my most treasured books. This work teaches black boys and gender nonconforming individuals to subsist in a world that seeks to build us out of it. It is the most powerful exploration of gender I have read next to Freshwater and the most touching memoir I have consumed next to In the Dream House. I state this praise with great care as both aforementioned titles are in my personal literature hall of fame. I related to the essays with a level of intimacy that I cannot name and maintain that the work itself exists as a powerful tool to fight marginalization and the ways we might internalize it. George's writing is casual but engrossing as he fluidly explores a myriad of topics relevant to the black queer body through a critical lens while still managing to fill the pages with black joy, love, hope, and celebration. Preorder this book - it releases in April. I want everybody and their mama to read it. Notes: Undoubtedly some elitists will denounce this book's casual teen-centric writing style, but George is able to deliver his messages without complex prose, proving that colloquial language is All Boy's Aren't Blue's strength, not its weakness.

Banning books is so wrong; not only is it unconstitutional, but I find it to be a type of thought-policing. It also makes me wonder-- what's in this book that you're so desperately trying to hide? There is literally no faster way to make me read something than by unhauling it from a library, and best be sure that I'm going to tell all my followers to read it, too.For a banned book, ALL BOYS AREN'T BLUE really isn't that revolutionary or extraordinary, which honestly says a lot about the people trying to remove this from shelves. Most of what the author, George M. Johnson, says makes a lot of sense. They talk a lot about their family life and not fitting in with boys or the expected gender norms of the Black and white communities. They talk about some of their early traumas and how that shaped them, whether it was being jumped at five, or watching their cousin nearly drown. They talk a lot about how integral their family's support was in shaping their identity and leading to what was, mostly, a healthy upbringing.Apparently, this is a memoir that is largely targeted at young adults, which explains why parts felt so instructional. I am not a young adult, so I realize-- belatedly-- that I am not in the target audience for this book. Despite that, I think there is so much value in this book as a resource. All the things the author talked about regarding the shaping of his identity and not fitting in will probably be so relatable and important for other nonbinary or trans kids experiencing the same thoughts and sense of alienation. Knowing you're not alone when you're feeling lonely and out of place is seriously such a balm. He also briefly discusses sex, and how sex with someone you like can be bad sex (a valuable lesson), and a little bit about sexual abuse, and the lasting impact that that can make on someone.I'm giving this a three star rating because it wasn't perfect and there were a few things I didn't like about it. The passage about 9/11, as other people have said, was a bit... uh, weird. They also made a choice to dead name one of their trans relatives, and while I believe this is to provide context about their family's struggle to understand and accept what being trans meant, it was a weird thing to do, especially since early on, George writes about the shock of finding out that his name wasn't really Matthew but George when he was a kid, and emphasizing the importance of calling people what they want to be called. Some of the essays also felt a little disorganized and messy. But what redeemed this book for me in the end were the great passages about their family and the overall message of staying true to yourself.3 to 3.5 starsShow more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 2 out of 5,"September 20, 2022",125 likes,1 comment,"Typically upon seeing the description of “a memoir-manifesto” in the title, I would have stayed away. I’m not big on declarations of manifestos, and I’m pretty removed from the Young Adult demographic. But then I came across a wonderful essay by one of my favorite GR reviewers on banned books, and followed his suggestion to request a banned book to make sure it stays in circulation. This book landed a #3 spot on the Top 10 Most Challenged Books of 2021 list by American Library Association (“Reasons: Banned and challenged for LGBTQIA+ content, profanity, and because it was considered to be sexually explicit”). So checking it out seemed like a no-brainer. “Nowadays, we are assigning gender even before birth. We have become socially conditioned to participate in the gendering of children at the earliest possible moment—whenever a sonogram can identify its genitalia. Gender-reveal parties have become a trendy way to celebrate the child’s fate, steering them down a life of masculine or feminine ideals before ever meeting them.”No, I didn’t care for it at all. I thought it was remarkably self-indulgent, even for a memoir which presumes quite a hefty dose of that, and a lot of focus seemed a bit off and misplaced. Everyone’s experience is valid, sure, but someone coming from such a supportive family and quite a comfortable existence in the middle class background may come to focus on things that don’t have an impact equal to what they perceive it to be for others. Some nuances in self-awareness seemed to be lost in this narrative, with a few relatively ordinary and banal experiences stretched a bit too much to make them necessary meaningful.It may be the influence of the titular manifesto, but there was too much preachiness and drawing conclusions from events based on quite tenuous connections, and insistence on spoonfeeding the readers all the conclusions Johnson wants us to reach. And those conclusions were strangely simplistic and shallow — and yet earnestly heavy-handed and self-indulgingly overanalyzed. Let the readers think for themselves instead of hitting them over the head with your points; it actually works better that way.Johnson is an engaging narrator, sure, but the problem is that there’s not enough meat in the way this story is presented to really engage me. The weak prose didn’t help either.And yet I would not want to forcibly prevent anyone from reading this book. Seriously, there is nothing here that should ever land it a spot on the Most Challenged Books list. The author wants to bring attention to the issues at the intersection of Black and queer experience, and does exactly that. A scene of brief sexual molestation by a relative is not written to be attractive, and shows what sadly is not as uncommon of an experience as we’d like it to be. And a brief description of his two other adult sexual encounters is also nothing that should have anyone - and yes, that includes even the parents of middle grade and young adult demographic - reaching for their smelling salts. (But we all know that for some people any same-sex experience inevitably leads to a serious case of pearl-clutching, so there’s that).It’s not a book for me, but it may be - and judging from its ratings, already has been - a good book for a different reader. So hopefully the pearl-clutchers give up and do something more productive with their lives. 1.5 stars — but let’s not take away others’ ability to access it freely from the library and form their own opinions.——————Also posted on my blog.Show more"

This is a powerful YA memoir about George exploring his sexuality, telling stories from his childhood, and it's written so beautifully. The story-telling in this book is so raw and I loved feeling as if we were growing up alongside him and rooting for him the whole way through. I listened to the audiobook which is read by the author and it was the best experience. I think this is a great place to start if you are new to nonfiction and you are looking for own voices stories, because it nearly reads like a story and I just really loved the complex family dynamics in this book, especially the stories of his Grandmother and when he eventually joins a Frat house and the brotherhood he finds among them. I love that he doesn't shy away from talking about the harder things and the mistakes he's made, it just makes it feel more real and raw.

And I genuinely mean everyone especially the black community. Sometimes I don't feel like people understand the stories and experiences of those who are both POC and identify as Queer especially black women and men. I'm so happy that George decided to share his story. He talked about everything from coming out to toxic masculinity. Sometimes I'm proud of how far the Black community has come in relation to the LGBTQIA+ community; however, I'm also always reminded of how far we have to go. Just hearing about how Black trans women have been treated while protesting this past week has been quite disheartening. What I loved most about this book is that it was written in such a positive light. George speaks of his own experiences in such a rewarding and reassuring manner. This isn't a book written for queer men of color to discourage them or make them feel bad, but to uplift them and give them a perspective that is often left out of many narratives. Even though the book was not intended for me, I appreciated everything that he had to say and I could appreciate how honest and forthcoming he was about ALL of his experiences. One that really touched my heart was his discussion about his fraternity. If ya'll didn't know, I'm a part of a HBGLO (historically Black Greek letter organization) and sometimes I get worried about how toxic masculinity plays a role in whether queer men are able to join. It was so wonderful to see that positive relationships that came out of his journey being a part of Alpha Phi Alpha. I think sometimes as readers we forget about the importance of intersectionality. It's great to see books about queer POC's written by queer POC's. We need more of these books in the world. Especially books that are positive and give hope.

Johnson’s life and memoir. But despite this book not being written for me, specifically, I believe there’s still a lot that can’t be learned from the author’s words and experiences.“The spectrum of our traumas can be as broad as our identities.”Johnson’s stated goal in All Boys Aren’t Blue is to offer some guidance to kids navigating an LGBTQ+ and/or black identity in America right now. He wants to be a lifeline to those that feel isolated because of who they are or how they feel; one he didn’t have access to growing up. In order to achieve this he shares memories and stories from his own life. Some are funny, others are painful, but each is 100% candid. I was impressed with how open he was in bearing his scars to the world, and I appreciated how he shared even the most intimate pieces of himself.There’s a rawness in Johnson’s storytelling that I think will reach most people who pick up this book. I’d recommend it to not just teenagers going through something similar, but to the adults around them. Johnson has an incredibly understanding and loving family, and that’s something that I’m sure would be beneficial for a number of parents to listen and learn from. *Audiobook (narrated by the author) is currently available for for free on Hoopla*Show more"

I liked the story about the author's name. One thing we all have in common is worrying about what other people think of us, queer or not, it happens to all of us. Growing up with cousins and all being taken care of by granny, awesome as she was, sounds fun. She's definitely the coolest grandma ever. The cowboy boots story had me smiling. I liked the advice about speaking up and other advices, including time. This book started with an introduction about the author, how he came out to the world with a full head of hair and his aunt thought he was a girl. He discussed about gender and what society decide for a person and the activities that shape a person into that of boy or girl. He discussed about how the ""n word"" was buried so that the black community could be treated with respect. The author recalled being five and was a good actor so no other kids would make fun of him for the truth of his wants. This book is divided into four acts: a different kid, family, teenagers, and friends. All Boys Aren't Blue is well written and full of honest disclosures. I'm glad that George did have relatives that were lgbt to support him and his family the basic knowledge while growing up. It would have been harder if his family didn't accept him being different. I like the letters within the story. The family photos are an added bonus. I'm glad someone taught him sex, better a trusting someone than a stranger who will take advantage of an innocent first time. I like the reasons of the book title. This memoir sure pulled out all emotions from me. I highly recommend everyone to read this book!xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details Many thanks to Fierce Reads for the opportunity to read and review.

All Boys Aren't Blue covers a myriad of topics from sexual discovery to family dynamics to internalised homophobia through short essays and anecdotes. Johnson pulls stories from his childhood and own experiences, then explores and relates them to issues others might be struggling with. The storytelling style is unembellished and blunt. No words are wasted, and the message hits home. We follow him from a child through to adulthood in a way where I felt as if I was growing up with him, making mistakes and learning along the way. Some stories were heartwarming, others hilarious and a few devastating- but they all wove together to tell a story that is desperately needed. In the YA community, we are getting more ownvoices books about black protagonists, or queer ones- but a notable gap is the intersectionalities that lie between them. That is why it is so important that books such as this one are being published. If only one black queer kid stumbles upon this book, it has been a success. If you are new to reading non-fiction, this could be a good place to start. The memoir-manifesto doesn't simply recite facts, but tells a personal, captivating and nuanced story that leaves you with a greater empathy. While this book may be short, it packs an emotional and lasting punch that I know I will be thinking about for a long time.

However, the author's life is rather blessed I feel as he had a very loving, caring and an understanding family. I just loved reading about his relationship with his Nanny.This book portrayed well the struggles of growing up as a young queer boy, someone who is different and whose preferences are different from the rest, but more specifically the struggle with identity.I just love how the author invented new words. It's fun!And yes, the author talks about many misconceptions and the assumptions that people have regarding the community. It's so damn liberating to read about it with such a clear-cut presentation of what's what and what's not. I mean who says gays cannot play sports?Author, your book is giving a big punch to everyone who's making that assumption!I felt so bad when there were parts about bullying and harrassment. And yes, this memoir taught me one very big important lesson that is:Not everything written in history or what is being taught to us is the exact truth. Many personalities in history are known now for something not exactly they didn't fight for.Did Lincoln make a pact only to free the black from slavery?Actually it's time to learn the real 'facts'. But me not being well-versed with historic events won't start arguing about it.Let's leave this for now.Coming back to the memoir, I like how the author narrated some very personal events that took place when he wasn't aware much of what was happening. Here the author tried to differentiate what's sexual harrassment and who can be the ones who do the same to you.Towards the end of the book, the author shows how important it is to accept ourselves and not just live according to what others assume for us specially, the black queer community.Some parts about death and grief are heartbreaking.I just loved reading this memoir. The writing is amazing!(I came to know about the better term of LGBTQ plus through this memoir. It's LGBTQIAP+ 💫)...""The brightest spot that summer was me falling in love for the first time.

Young Black queer individuals under the age of twenty three (I learnt that this book is classified as young adult memoir, a genre I did not know existed, and so this makes sense) and both non-Black and non-Queer individuals. It's an informative, even instructive, book where the writer uses the experiences they've faced in a socio-political context to explore the history of racist, homophobic and transphobic oppression; their present-day repercussions; as well as the ways in which they can be remedied to create a better world.As a rule I don't read memoirs written by individuals under 45 (the number keeps going up the older I get) unless the writer was witness to a momentous event and whose account informs and enriches its history. I don't think focusing on narrating traumatic incidents (warning for sexual abuse and violence) as is the case with a lot of memoirs, this one too, necessarily makes good writing. Yet I can't ignore just how resourceful and even important this book is, or the flashes of pleasure I got from seeing a story similar to mine in some ways written. I think it just comes down to having encountered most of the politics discussed here better articulated.Show more"

This book is nothing more than a preachy, solipsistic diatribe that adds nothing to the discourse surrounding race, sexuality, history, or any of the other topics it touches upon. It isn't groundbreaking or interesting in the slightest, and though it is aimed at YA readers, it does them a great disservice by lecturing to them rather than illustrating its themes through careful nuance. If this book hadn't been banned all over the place it would have receded to the black hole it belongs in. Now, unfortunately, it will be vaunted into Black queer canon. All Boys Aren't Blue is proof yet again that White conservatives truly hate Black and queer people and, conversely, White liberals will fawn over anything Black or queer.Show more"

It was an incredibly impactful read as we learn about George M. Johnson’s life, growing up as a black gay man in America. It was equally saddening and uplifting at the same time. I felt that I learned so much from Johnson’s account of their personal experiences. They really opened up about so many of the people and events in their life that helped them find themself and made them into who they are today, as they worked to accept who they truly were in an internal struggle. I think that every single person who reads this can relate to one aspect or another, from the family dynamics to finding new friends in college to just trying to figure out who you are and where you belong. I think that this book will help so many people who are/were struggling with their identity as Johnson was when they were growing up. I hope that this book helps others find themselves and not be afraid to share who they are with the world.

You are seen!Overall the audiobook was a quick read for me. It’s only 5 hrs and 12 mins long, and it didn’t read like a traditional memoir, at least for the most part. It read like a compilation of different stories of the author’s life. And he even calls it story telling. Stories about his youth, his family and his journey of finding his identity, and sexuality.And as expected it was fascinating, and I loved how incredibly candid, and open the author was. Because the openness is what will help teenagers find their own path.And he doesn’t sugar coat anything. The overall voice of the book is one of a teacher, a guide, and he puts all the information out there to be read by teenagers who struggle with sexual identity. He wrote a book that he wished someone would have told him about when he was young. That’s incredibly powerful and moving.___________________________________Find more reviews and book recommendations on my blogFollow me on BookstagramShow more"

Reviews are meant to be honest so here goes. I don't think this book is as good as the hype around it. Don't get me wrong, it's good. Johnson takes us through a journey of his youth as a Black queer kid. From bullying to first sexual encounters, this is a classical coming-of-age novel with social commentary sprinkled through. Johnson doesn't hesitate to share the bad and the good of his upbringing, painting the life of a queer and Black kid, abound with code-switching, a supportive family and confusion about identity. However, I felt Johnson was doing a lot of telling and not nearly enough showing. At times, his commentary on his childhood was interesting but for the most part, it felt like he was shouting at us, ""Look at how meaningful and relevant this is!!"". And truly, it is but I felt like I was being spoon fed ideas that I should and could have reached by myself. By being so involved in the storytelling of his life, Johnson didn't really let us involve ourselves in his story.For example, there's a part where he discusses how he always thought his name was Matthew and suddenly he learned his first name is actually George. It led to a point where some people called him Matthew and others George as well as other experiences in school and with his parents. Of course, this is so symbolic and interesting in a queer perspective, as queer people do have a special connection to names and their representation (like I have a non-gendered name and when I applied to jobs and got asked if I'm a man or a woman, I never knew what to answer). I think a common queer experience is that moment when you consider whether to change your name. However, when Johnson stresses that it's interesting in a queer way, he takes away our ability to build something ourselves. He doesn't do this in any kind of literary or poetic way, it's just flat out analysis. This book is at its best when Johnson digs deep into the system, taking his own experiences and showing the way they relate to various struggles. Like, either my elementary school didn't have Black History Month or I just don't remember it but in any case, we really don't focus nearly enough on making sure kids have role models that they can see themselves in them. He makes an eloquent case for why it's important. His own experiences are broadcast into wider social problems and it is fascinating.As a whole, if you've never read anything about Black people or queer people, this might be really interesting for you. If you've read about this topic already, I don't think this book adds many new ideas to the conversation. It comes across as repetitive at times. I'm glad this book exists and Johnson does have much to say but yeah, I can't say I loved this.  What I'm Taking with Me - Idk man, there seems to be more negatives than positives in the sorority life, so glad that's not a thing here. - His grandmother seems like a truly special person.- It was interesting hearing about the way he explained switching from a mixed space to a Black one (like a Black college). Like, I imagine it's something white people just don't think about.Show more"

Johnson's life - who is a journalist and queer activist, growing up Black and queer. It's a series of personal essays exploring his childhood, adolescence, and college years. From his memory of getting his teeth kicked in at the age of 5, to his first sexual relationships, and beyond.This book almost had me in tears, my eyes were literally watering. it covers so many topics: gender identity, toxic masculinity, Black culture, brotherhood, family, systemic racism, structural marginalization, consent, as well as Black joy.I am so happy that George M. Johnson decided to share his story. This is a book I want everyone to read. Despite a lot of the gut-wrenching topics this book covers, George M. Johnson's writing style really wrote all of this, somehow, in a positive light. There was still a feeling of hope and light to everything. It is a book to encourage and uplift, specifically queer Black men, but more than people than that. To show us all a perspective that is often left out of many narratives.I highly recommend this. It is brutal and raw, there is a list of content warnings at the beginning of it that include sexual assault, molestation, loss of virginity, homophobia, racism, and anti-blackness. But this book is also uplifting in a way that is much needed for our queer youth, especially the Black folks.Show more"

The essays take us through the author’s life from his childhood to adulthood, as he navigated different spheres and phases of life. He explored growing up amidst other teenage boys who sought to shame him for his feminine interests, trying hard as a college student to join a fraternity to feel a sense of male belonging, and also navigating relationships and sex as a queer adult male.

This is objectively one of the most important books I have ever read, especially for young queer Black boys in the US. Because through his own experiences, George M. Johnson paints the image of what it's like to grow up at that intersection of identities in the US. The author layed his soul bare, opened up about his experiences, his trauma, his relationships and the gave some words of wisdom and lessons he picked up along the way to pave the way through for the kids coming up after him, he did all of that to ease it on them, so that they don't have to do it themselves and don't have to go years confused and wondering. And this is exactly why I think this book should land between the hands of every young queer Black kids, but especially boys. Because this memoir is for them. It's about them.Through multiple acts and chapters, George M. Johnson explores a wide variety of topics. From owning up to his blackness to trying to assimilate to embracing it again, repressing his queerness for years upon years, his relationship with his family blood and chosen (especially his Nanny who he says is his best friend), the brothers he made in college, the expectations he had for his queerness and how they were confronted with reality, the trauma he underwent sometimes for one part of his identity, sometimes for the other and sometimes for both. How even though queerness was common in his family and he knew they would embrace him, he was not ready to come out to them, not for around 25 years, how it's not done and over with, it's a lifelong process. And so many more things that I cannot even begin to touch upon or graze the surface of because I won't do them justice.And the way he balances out his life experiences with statistics and more general thoughts and experiences and advice kept me engaged from start to finish and I found myself wanting to know more and wanting to hear more of the author's advice and words, either the cold hard truths or the soothing wisdom. I wanted to soak it all in. They just struck a chord with me, and I can't explain why. Show more"

Johnson’s story is one that is notably absent from YA. The issues of intersectionality are present in some fiction, but finding good memoirs/nonfiction can be rare. Johnson writes about his life growing up as black and queer in modern America, and he’s not afraid to cover it all. I picture this as an important read for kids who are exploring their own sexual/gender identities because, as Johnson says, “You sometimes don’t know you exist until you realize someone like you existed before.” This is a book that doesn’t know what it wants to be. To me the most compelling part of this book was Johnson’s memoir, where he details his experience growing up as a queer black boy in America. Where it was a bit clumsy was the integration of the statistics or facts at the end of some of the chapters. It felt out of place and like a minor nod to the bigger issue connected to his experience. In general, his writing style was a bit bland for my taste. There were a few gems that I was compelled to write down, but overall I felt like the prose was a bit dry.Publishers should be looking out for more voices like Johnson’s. Kids need to read this kind of stuff, and not just the kids who are questioning.Show more"

I know this isn't predominantly aimed at me, but there was still so much I took away from this. It touches on so many topics, from grief and familial relationships, racism, gender nonconformity and expectations and sexuality. It's not an easy read by any means, George has gone through a lot in his life that have defined the person they are today and not all their experiences have been good. But every story is told with honesty and passion, and often also with love. George's family are the real stars of his memoirs, particularly his mother and grandmother. They are incredibly strong characters who have tried to raise all their offspring with acceptance and love. The story of Hope in particular really touched me, to see the family instantly accept her for who she is with humour and love when so many like her have only witnessed rejection. As George's first example of seeing someone like himself (a member of the LGBTQ+), he takes her experience to heart and she becomes a role model of sorts, and his family's behaviour towards her shapes his own opinions too. Honestly I'd highly recommend this to everyone. There's so much to take away from George's experiences of being both black and LGBTQ+, and I already want to reread it. Show more"

But now I listen to audiobooks while walking every day and since I’m still more successful at nonfiction over fiction I decided to give it a go.I had no idea this was considered a YA release – I just thought it was an autobiography and a quick Google said the author is an LGBTQ+ advocate. And while portions of this story might be exactly what some young adults need to read in order to come out/speak up/feel seen/etc. – this was sort of a struggle for me. To start, Johnson’s middle-class upbringing and completely open and accepting family is one that often is not the norm for so many kids who fear coming out. Then there was the pretty clear-cut case of a Grover Gill schoolyard bully (who is probably serving time as an adult unless he got some serious help, because who the eff kicks the baby teeth out of a dang five year old???) that got morphed into some sort of gay bashing hate crime upon reflection. As a grown female, I really didn’t appreciate labeling football, basketball, baseball and even track “boy sports” – and I’m sure young women actively participating in them would take even more exception with that term. Also, Johnson did NOT invent the term “honeychild.” Nor did they write an original rap for the entire class that went a little something like “listen y’all and you will hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere” unless Johnson's real name is Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Which leads to the most offensive bits of the book. The entire “name trauma” situation???? If you were anywhere near as bright as you claimed to be throughout this entire book HOW IN THE HELL DID YOU NOT KNOW YOUR FAMILY CALLED YOU BY YOUR MIDDLE NAME UNTIL YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD?!?!?!? Ummm, every first day of school your teacher would have taken roll – calling out “George Johnson?” to which you would have responded “Here – but I go by my middle name Matthew.” And how is it TRAUMATIC to have a first name/middle name???? Equating that to a trans person’s dead name? Not cool. Even worse is calling out the dead name of a family member while telling the story of their transition – because apparently it is okay to do so when that person is no longer alive? Or maybe Johnson simply thinks it’s okay as there was also a selection about joining a fraternity (dear youngsters, they aren’t all as accepting as this one apparently was, so be careful if that is the path you choose) and eagerly swapping info that outed others without their consent. That is never okay.Obviously this was not for me. But I will fight to my last breath for it not to be banned. Fuck those people.Show more"

Johnson’s writing is casual yet intimate, it feels like he could be sitting right beside you as he tells you about his beloved grandmother “Nanny” or discusses growing up and hiding parts of himself to fit in. Even when discussing traumatic experiences and heartbreaking losses, the book also offers hope and an outstretched hand, reminding you that you are not alone in this fight called life.The common denominator of the chapters is that you feel the heart put in between these pages – Johnson covers a myriad of relevant topics, from racism, toxic masculinity, and sexual abuse all the way to responsibility, dealing with unspeakable losses, and the impending task of taking care of your elders, which all hit you right in the feels. It’s an honest and unflinching exploration of society’s compulsory heterosexuality and overwhelming gender expectations, but also of intergenerational and familial conflicts and connections, of not measuring up and then wondering why anyone ever even would want to measure up to expectations placed upon you by someone else instead of setting them for yourself. In the afterword, Johnson talks about how he believes that the queer community, right now, at this very moment, has the chance to be the blueprint for the next generation – to “trial and error” their way through life and decide what works, and what definitely has to go. In this memoir-manifesto, Johnson spotlights and exposes the trauma inflicted upon the black queer community but he also lends hope and encourages others to look beyond the boundaries that society has set for them and fight their way out of it.It’s hard to put into words how much this memoir will mean to a multitude of people but in particular black queer people. Yes, there is more media now representing the interests of black people and queer people, but intersectional representation does not get the attention it needs and deserves. All Boys Aren’t Blue should be mandatory reading for everyone because it inspires you to work harder to make this world a more open, more accepting place. It is a fight that’s never done fighting but reading this book reinvigorates your spirit and so I’ll just leave you with my favourite quote from the book where Johnson talks about being true to yourself and hope that will convince you to pick up a copy:“This won’t always be easy, I’m not going to lie. I won’t sell you the fable of “It Gets Better” like media tries to do without offering how. The how comes in being willing to take a chance on yourself and create the support system you wish to have. I would also tell you to reclaim that campaign slogan and use it from a place of power. Tell folks, especially those who are non-queer and non-Black, to “Make it Better.” Something getting better doesn’t happen without action, and you have every right to ask for that.”Johnson is right, we have the right to ask for that. And we also have the chance to Make It Better.Show more"

On the other hand, I’m so glad that this book will also be published in Europe (GB), and I was honored I could read it as an ARC.Because there are already so many reviews, I want to highlight one thing. In the first chapter, George M. Johnson mentions how society thinks about gender, even before birth.Gender is one of the biggest projections placed into children at birth...I often wonder what this world would look like if people were simply told: ‘You are having a baby with a penis or a vagina or other genitalia.A couple of months ago, I read The Prophets by Robert Jones jr., and part of his story was the queer African history where, in his story, children didn’t have a gender at birth. They all grew up gender-neutral and got to chose their gender later on, male, female, both, or none of the above. And that’s exactly what George M. Johnson points out:What if parents let their child explore their own gender instead of pushing them down one of the only two roads society tells us exist?My sons had a vacuum cleaner, a kitchen, dolls, cars, trains, etc. But still, they’ve always been boys to me, from the moment they were born. And I’m quite sure now they both identify as male (15 and 18), but what if they hadn’t? This memoir is not only important for Black queer kids but also for the rest of us, parents, people who’d want to be a parent, teachers, and so on, to understand how we’re so used to label everyone in society and what that does to our kids. For me, this story is food for thought!Finally, I want to scream out how beautiful this cover is!!!I received an ARC from Penguin Random House Children’s UK and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Show more"

George relates their story growing up Black and queer, and discusses the white-washed nature of history, oppression, racism, and the intersection of queer and Black identities. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend the audiobook. It's narrated by the author, and offers an immersive, intimate reading experience that I highly enjoyed. Johnson's writing is powerful, and packs a major emotional punch. They uplift, celebrate, and encourage queer Black boys to live with joy and pride. I especially loved reading about George's family; Johnson grew up in a loving, supportive home, and was especially close with their grandmother (their relationship was super sweet). However, George doesn't shy away from sharing their traumas from childhood, and contemplates how these traumas deeply impacted their younger years and growth into adulthood. I loved this book so much. All Boys Aren't Blue is a beautiful tapestry of Black joy, and an achingly meaningful exploration of gender and masculinity.

Absurd!! This is a book that is straight from the heart. The author, a gay educated Black man, writes from personal experience. When he was young, he wanted to skip rope with girls rather than play football. He always knew that he was different; what saved him was a family, especially his Nanny. The family was love, all the time, whatever the situation. Many people do not experience this type of love. His mother and Nanny always knew that he was gay but did not push the issue. They just loved him. He was abused sexually and took a long time to discover himself. Finally the love and care of fraternity brothers in college gave him the assurance that he could be what he wanted to be. He wrote this book to inform others. As the mother of a gay man, I found some things to learn in this book. One chapter is quite graphic sexually but it happened. I see no reason to prevent anyone from reading this. I can not see how anyone reading this painful, mildly graphic book could be harmed. If anything, he or she would be educated - the goal of those in civilized society. I recommend this book to everyone; it can help you learn to deal with others who are not like you; it can help you learn to be protective of others who are being abused. Get it; read it; pass it on.

I learnt much about my own life (as a nineteen years old) and it made me hopeful about my own future. I Identified closely with your life, perhaps due the fact that my life is similar to yours. I somehow never seem to fit into the boxes society tries to put us in.

You explain your life stories in a way that made me relate and also gave me hope in a very dark tunnel. It makes me feel like you wrote a love letter with instruction how to survive in life even when you do not fit. It was good of you to include the TW for what will be in your book. For me it is really important to feel safe that I can know beforehand what is coming and choose if I can cope with it or not.Once again thank you for making this book.

It was very well done.But let's get to the book. This is a memoir with a little bit of a twist. While he told stories of his personal life that defined the person he is today, he also sends a little message to everyone on the same journey as him. Not all the chapters end with a lesson, but many do and while I know these lessons aren't for me, I definitely learned some things.Johnson also writes a few open letters to people who have touched his life. From his mother, nanny, and some friends, he writes with love and passion for these people. The most touching letters are the ones to those who had passed. I can only imagine it being heartbreaking to talk about and even more difficult to write in a letter.He really dives into some very real experiences including sexual abuse, racism, classism, having to be Abraham Lincoln in his elementary school play, coming out to his family, and finding friendship in the most unlikely places like his college's fraternity.Overall, absolutely loved this book and if you're facing a journey similar to that of George M Johnson, I highly suggest picking up this book.

It is impossible to resist the challenge it throws at the reader. The book just screams: Pick me up if you dare. The moment I saw the cover and title, I knew I'd read this book. George M. Johnson is a New York-based writer-cum-activist. There are two things that go against him in general public opinion: he is black, and he is gay. This book narrates the struggles he has faced all through his life, the trauma, the repercussions, the challenges, and the opportunities. As the tagline suggests, the book isn't just a memoir but also a manifesto. The author confesses his deepest, darkest fears and secrets and also declares how he overcame them. In many of the chapters, he includes advice to young people facing the same issues on how to deal with this identity crisis. So, how does it fare against the expectations it creates?The book is powerful and impactful, there is absolutely no doubt about that. The straightforward approach of the author comes out very strongly. He seems to have viewed this book as a cathartic opportunity to purge himself of all the anxiety and pain he has kept bottled up in his early years. However, while dwelling on his sexual memories, he goes into a vivid, almost-erotic delineation of his experiences, both consensual and otherwise. Was he just trying to demonstrate the rawness of his pain by being so explicit? I honestly don't know. But it didn't click with me. I must say, the author does warn about this in the introduction itself, where he says that the topic might seem too heavy for teens but he encountered all the abuse as a teen. So he has his valid reasons for including them. There is a lot of bravery in the book, but there is a lot of cockiness too. He almost seems to boast about his achievements in many places. Memoirs that proclaim ""Look at me, see how great I am"" are big turn-offs for me. For the correct target audience i.e. American gay black young adults, the book will probably be a must-read and much more identifiable. But a book such as this mustn't aim at a limited set of readers but should speak to society as a whole. In this day and age, it is extremely important for everyone to understand the challenges faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. That, however, doesn't happen in this case and the writing seems a bit shortsighted and restricted in its approach.Furthermore, I think the author should have written this book either as a memoir or as a manifesto. In the quest to do both, he ends up with a jumbled-up result. It is not a bad read, it is definitely not an easy read, but it could have been so much better had the author kept his focus on only one item on his agenda.The audiobook is narrated by the author himself and he does a pretty good job. My rating: 4.75 for the intention, 3.5 for the execution.Trigger warnings: Rape, physical abuse, sexual abuse, N word, some homophobic slurs, graphic descriptions of sex. *************************************Join me on the Facebook group,

I will link a review below that I recommend reading from a Black and gender-nonconforming reviewer who is fantastic.- Review from Jesse (bowtiesandbooks): https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The book takes us from childhood to adolescence and college, showing the unique challenges of being intersectionally Black and queer and the slow path to understanding one's identity and eventually feeling safe enough to express it. There is so much love infused throughout this book for friends and family, you can feel the deep care and consideration of the author, even when discussing the ways these people were imperfect or hurtful. While his family wasn't perfect and never openly discussed his queer identity, they did their best to be loving and accepting throughout his childhood. Nanny (Johnson's grandmother) is a central figure throughout the book and was really an anchor for him.There are discussions of his complicated relationship with his father who tried to get things right after failing with his much older (and also gay) son. There is also a chapter dealing with sexual abuse and molestation that occurred during Johnson's teen years at the hands of an older cousin and a classmate. There is some graphic depiction, but while it is clear that this was harmful abuse, there is also an astounding amount of compassion for the (now passed away) abuser who may have been subjected to something similar. Content warnings for that, but I think it is handled really well. We do see how those events led the author to delay sexual intimacy for many years due to a lack of trust, but eventually there is a chapter on his eventual introduction to sex as an adult. This includes two somewhat graphically described encounters, one positive and one more negative, followed by a discussion of what was learned, the challenges of having had limited sex ed in school, and how the author hopes teens reading this might be better prepared and have fewer negative experiences. There is much more that I could say because this book is incredibly rich and I applaud the vulnerability and thoughtfulness of the author. From discussions of the ways gender is forcefully constructed for young children to microagressions and the unique challenges of being Black and queer, this book is doing a lot of incredible work but in a way that is easy to read, thought-provoking, and useful for a younger audience. Absolutely recommend this one. I received an advance copy of this book for review from the publisher. All opinions are my own.CW include bullying, molestation, sexual assault, loss of a loved one, mentions of AIDS and cancer, homophobiaShow more"

Johnson isn't a memoir written for me, a mature woman who has a mostly White racial appearance raised in a middle-20th-century White low-income neighborhood. It isn't an exciting or novel adventure nor is it abuse-porn. It's about a very ordinary boy with one difference, who grows up in an ordinary household in an ordinary neighborhood. First, it's a memoir written about growing up in the late 20th-century. It's detail is such it's in an almost technical or manual-like style for YA or teens. Second, it's a bildungsroman of a Black male. It is the plainest bildungsroman I've ever read - a straightforward straightalk bildungsroman of a middle-class American boy. Third, Johnson was always surrounded by a loving supportive family. Fourth, it's about the messages of masculinity he learned he should strive to encapsulate within himself if he wanted to be accepted by people. Fifth, it's about how he gradually learned he was gay, and how he had to hide that fact even if his mannerisms constantly exposed his sexuality (he was effeminate). It was important to his survival and success in getting into college and into a fraternity that he deny his sexuality. Sixth, it's about how he gradually came out as gay, safely, without drama, and learned about what gay sex involved, safely.The book spoke to me - not. But if I was a boy wondering if my insecurities were silly or defined me as weak or weird, I'd want to read this book. I certainly would recommend this book to any gay boy.Show more"

However, I have read books by people from many cultures, races, sexual identities and other backgrounds and am always interested in building empathy and learning about others' experiences.This will be an unpopular opinion, but this book just did not sit well with me. The author is both Black and queer. I absolutely believe he has experienced all sorts of racism, oppression, and homophobia because to be in either of those groups in America is to have experienced some sort of prejudice and discrimination. I was fully ready to enter into his experience, whether it be primarily positive or severely not so or anywhere in between.What I have trouble with is this constant suggestion that he has been severely victimized but the stories he tells and the examples he gives are anything but. While getting jumped with his cousins at the age of five and getting his teeth kicked out is certainly traumatic, he attributes this to his being effeminate with no evidence whatsoever that this was the case. He also spends far more time worried about his smile and the fact that he had big front teeth (like every eight year old that lives), and reminded the reader constantly of his unwillingness to smile (contrary to the photos) throughout the remainder of the book. He was pushed into a pool by his cousins to learn to swim... like children have been learning to swim for at least a couple centuries. He had two older boys who could both swim right there making sure he was okay, but he had to explain multiple times to the reader how serious this situation was. The name situation in particular felt like made-up drama. He was called by his middle name for the first several years of his life-his legal middle name, which is just as much a ""real"" name as your first name. One day he found out his first name was actually something different. He was upset because he had a different ""real"" name. His family gave him the agency to decide after that what he would prefer to be called. This is not trauma. After he compares this with transgender children being called by names that don't match their internal identities, he throws in this statement: ""I bet most of you never thought to ever question if you even like your name."" Except for almost every child on the planet. Like being embarrassed about your teeth, learning about your name and deciding how you feel about it is an experience common to many children and has nothing to do with being Black or being queer. This book reminds me of someone I know well who came from an abusive home. He absolutely was abused emotionally and verbally with significant impact, but when someone asked him ""What happened?"" his response was ""My parents lied to me about Santa Claus. It really scarred me when I found out the truth."" I firmly believe everyone should be able to find themselves in books, and that representation matters. I believe people not of a particular group should also read these books to learn about others' experiences, to understand better, to be kinder. But if one is going to assume the responsibility of becoming that representative (and the author makes certain to pat himself firmly on the back many times for this and other things), they must be responsible about that representation. If you want others to understand how your experience has been different, particularly more difficult or oppressive, than theirs, you cannot do it by being specially victimized by the everyday trials common to the race of man. I felt like I was reading a journal kept by someone at the prompting of their therapist, as opposed to a published work meant to be read by others. Disappointing.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63448764-kat,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 3 out of 5,"February 27, 2023",15 likes,0,"All Boys Aren't Blue is as much a memoir of a gay Black man growing up in New Jersey in the 1990s as it is a guide and tool for current and future generations of lost queer boys and young men.In this book, George M. Johnson shares stories of his childhood, teenage years, first sexual encounters, relationships with different family members, and his time at college. The stories he shares are very personal, and one can only guess how difficult it must have felt to share some of them, especially given the fact that they deal with sexual assault, homophobia, and the death of loved ones.The first thing I have to say is that I respect the author for writing down and confronting his past and believing in getting this book published. It’s not easy to sell your story if you’re a nobody, if no one knows you, if you’re someone who is not a world-famous artist, sportsperson, politician. That takes a lot of guts and self-confidence, and it’s a good thing George M. Johnson was able to get this story out in the world because there are others like him; other Black queer boys who don’t know how to be themselves in a society that rejects them, who will read this book and hopefully not only feel seen and understood but who will learn from the author’s mistakes.The author shares valuable insights into what it’s like to grow up Black and queer, always be the odd one out at school, constantly lie to other boys, and even to one’s friends about one’s sexuality. He discusses heteronormativity, toxic masculinity, and gender identity in a way that was and will be very easy to follow for teens and young adult readers. The writing, in general, is very ‘down to earth’ and will be accessible even for those who haven’t studied gender theory or feminist theories.However, I found that it was sometimes just a bit undercooked. I wish it had been more prosaic, flowier, if that makes any sense. It seemed to be a bit juvenile, sometimes repetitive.Furthermore, I agree with this review in saying the author used the term “trauma” way too loosely, in my opinion. When he was five years old, he had his teeth kicked out by a group of children a few years older than him, an incident that he describes as his introduction to trauma. When his mum told him not to use the word “Honeychild” anymore (a term that the author claims he invented himself even though it was already in use before he was born), he calls it ‘trauma’. When he was 8-years-old and learnt that his real name is ‘George’ and not Matthew, the author once again refers to that experience as traumatic, linking it to trans experiences of dead-name calling. The latter is particularly interesting given that in the chapter in which he talks about his transgender cousin Hope, he uses her dead name…Regarding the storytelling itself, I was a bit annoyed by how exaggerated and showy it seemed from time to time. When he writes about his mum being prepped for surgery, he says that “a tear rolled from each of [his] eyes.” I mean, yeah, give me a break. The author also uses 9/11 as a weird backdrop to a chapter that is really all about him crushing on a boy he saw on the school bus that day. It starts like this: “It was September 11, 2001, the first day of my junior year of high school”, but then he just goes on talking about his crush. The events of 9/11 are entirely irrelevant for that chapter, and yet the author felt like shoehorning in the date to- what? Make his story more relevant? More important? To put himself in the centre of a tragic event? It just… didn’t sit right with me.The book has flaws significant enough for me not to be able or willing to oversee them, but it’s an important and timely book, nevertheless. Students and young adults of all genders and races should have access to this book. I do believe it is a very valuable source for teens who are in the same or similar situations the author was in when they were young though it’s just as crucial for the likes of me and everyone who isn’t Black/male/queer/… as it celebrates diversity of thought and allows outsiders insight into what it can look like to grow up as a part of two intersecting minority groups.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7074816-mel-epic-reading,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 3, 2022",17 likes,0,"This is a memoir that every single person who reads it will come away with something different. It’s honest, and represents what is reality for so many boys like George. At the end of the day (I hope) more queer boys will experience the family love he has then will be shunned by their family. It’s important to have a memoir that represents something other than just abandonment and abuse. Something a little more normative, even if not what society deems normal at all. George also shows an extreme amount of empathy and understanding that many can’t, or won’t, ever be able to. People like George are how we change society. We have to forgive (but never ever forget as that keeps us safe) and move forward to create the safe space we want. What will stand out for me, and has been my truth now for a couple of years, is this statement about coming out: ”It is not a final thing. It’s something that is ever occurring. You are always having to come out somewhere” This is by far the most truthful statement about being queer, in whatever way you are. I have the perfect disguise you see; my life partner is a man, and I’m a woman. I can blend in seamlessly with few people ever knowing or even suspecting I also like women. As I approach 40 I’ve recently realized I’m not satisfied with that anymore. I have come out during the pandemic to more and more people, mostly women who like women as I easily identify them. They can’t hide like I can. But wearing pride socks and gloves isn’t enough anymore. I should be proud to be bisexual and support all the queer people around me. Hiding is not supporting them. Hiding is lying; just as George presents in his memoir. The one person I’ve never ever hid it from is my life partner, husband, and person I love more than I ever thought possible. He has always known and always allowed space for it. He understood when I told him (at one time) I’d pick Halle Berry over anyone (male or female) because she was the most stunning to me. There are amazing heterosexual people out there. George really shows these people (in his life) off which I appreciated a lot. Each time I come out to someone I feel love and support, as they are also queer. One day I will have to come out again to someone who isn’t, I just hope the reaction is such as George has encountered and not that the extreme negativity of what I received as an early 20-something. George’s story, while not without really hard moments and abuse, is proof that we can all do this. We can live side-by-side and still love whom we want. If you have any inclination to understand the LGBTQ+ community, are a member, want to come out, or know someone struggling to be seen as out; then read this. And then pass it to someone else who needs it. Eventually we will be the majority and those homophobic assholes will have nowhere to safely hide.Show more"

""As an adult, I have gone through the unlearning to understand that my community’s treatment of Black queer children is in fact a by-product of a system of assimilation to whiteness and respectability that forces Black people to fit one mold in society, one where being a man means you must be straight and masculine. I didn’t have the ability to separate my Blackness from my queerness. The loss of my smile was as much a denial of my Black joy as it was my queer joy. When I did smile, it was a coping mechanism.

I'm pretty sure I highlighted the whole book.(The following is from a review I posted on my IG.)All Boys Aren't Blue is a book that changed my life. It gave me the agency to reclaim my name and the way I walk through this world, and I don't think I'll ever be able to separate that from how much I love this memoir. I don't think I'll ever want to.George M. Johnson's self-described memoir manifesto is a brilliant piece of work, and its power comes from its ability to divorce itself completely from the white cishet gaze. This text is very much for QTPOC youth. It is a hand outstretched to them as they learn how to move through this world⁠—a world that places more value in their pain than in their joy. It's about straddling multiple identities and struggling to express yourself fully across every social circle in your life.Each chapter is a hard-won lesson about detangling toxic masculinity from Blackness, otherness from queerness, and slivers of joy from moments of loss. It is painstaking work, and so beautifully written. I have so much love for this memoir, and if you haven't read this one yet, I highly recommend it! Show more"

Johnson has this unshakeable belief that he is special, and I don’t mean this in a dismissive way. All people are special and their lives are filled with poignant moments of beauty and complexity, but he is self-righteous and constantly presenting himself in a self-centered way that is grounded in his sense that he is the focal point of all suffering--the kind of person that would attend someone’s funeral and make it all about their own pain, calling attention to themselves by wailing louder than everyone else around them. Not once does he acknowledge his own privilege and how lucky he was to have the family he did and to grow up in the area he did. He had both parents, was middle class, and was able to even go to private schools, which he claims were indicative of the school-to-prison pipeline. Ummmmm….private parochial schools that have harsh rules are not what that phrase is referring to, but okay. What about the many other kids in Jersey who grew up in underserved communities who had no option but to attend schools that were literally made to look like prisons and behaved in a similar fashion? Oh those are the type of kids, he proudly claimed his uncle beat the crap out of in order to exact revenge (which is what it is, but all this in a chapter about how violence is destructive). Just no self awareness. He concluded each chapter with a heavy handed thesis, which I guess is why this is a manifesto of sorts, but they lack complexity and do very little to showcase the complexity of intersectional identities in contemporary U.S. society. His life story is powerful, but the way he presents it is weak. Show more"

There are some sexual encounters in this memoir that are slightly graphic, but necessary. These are not included for reader-fantasy here, but rather for the realism George has growing into adulthood.I really liked how feminine-George can still play football. He really shows anyone can do anything. He doesn't preach about how to ignore what others think. He actually shows that there can be name-calling indeed.

Despite this nurturing home, Johnson wrestled with the intersections of his race and sexuality as he learned to code switch and inhabit both majority-white spaces like his catholic high school and majority-Black spaces like his HBCU. As he grows, Johnson confronts his queer desires and learns about himself along the way. And he tales a tell that will help those younger than him avoid the emotional and mental pitfalls he encountered along his journey.Admittedly, I had avoided this book for quite some time as I am not a fan of Young Adult books and rarely a fan of memoirs as debut books. But as I watched Conservatives and Republicans across the country ban this book, I decided I needed to give it a read. What Johnson has done with this book is truly incredible: he has produced a one-of-a-kind book for the young queer, Black kids who struggle to find their place in life. Rather than banning this book, our leaders should be reflecting on why the institutions they control create the barriers that lead to the struggles of the kids. Although All Boys Aren't Blue is a 4-star from me because of the disjunction between myself and its intended audience, for young people it is a 5-star must read. This book will truly save lives.Show more"

JOHNSONI wanted to get this review posted before the end of Pride Month and I barely made it, even though this book and the LGBTQIA+ community should be loved, accepted, and celebrated ALL year long. All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson is a collection of personal essays going through his childhood to adulthood as a Queer, Black man. This collection is important and needed. It can help those who are struggling with their own identity or those who need to understand the experiences of this community and how to love-TRULY love, accept, and celebrate them.“Symbolism gives folks hope. But I’ve come to learn that symbolism is a threat to actual change-it’s a chance for those in power to say, ‘look how far you have come’ rather than admitting, ‘look how long we have stopped you from getting here.”GEORGE M. JOHNSONThis is an incredible memoir and I don’t say that lightly. This book could save lives. It is Pride Month and we all see the corporations with rainbow advertising but it is really people like George M. Johnson who will make REAL change in the world. But he should not be trying to make this change alone. This book is both inspiring and heartbreaking. The first story is how was jumped at the age of five–then how his first sexual experience was actually sexual assault. But I did love his family support system. The stories about his grandmother are everything.This book does touch on many subjects like consent, sexual assault, sexual identity, racism, and toxic masculinity. I listened to the audiobook and it is narrated by the author. I could have kept listening long after it ended. George M. Johnson is a beautiful soul and we could all learn what it means to be a truly supportive human to everyone. I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars.Show more"

Johnson's story from birth to adulthood. One of the first experiences he shares with the readers is when he was 5 years old and got his teeth kicked out. That was one of many painful experiences he shares with readers in this book but there are counterparts of victorious moments too. The support of his family was something that stuck out to me. Instead of being a statistic like he mentions in the book where families kick out their queer children, his family embraced him and other family members who were part of the LGBTQ+ community. Growing up and not seeing yourself represented on TV or even in school takes a toll on a person.  To be the change the author would like to see in the world he is using his platform to be a voice against toxic masculinity and to help marginalized groups like the LGBTQ+ community so they can feel safe to be themselves without having to cover up their true identity. After reading this book, Gabrielle Union has opted to make this into a Sony Pictures TV series. More info here.I found this to be a compelling story.

Suffice it to say this audiobook spoke to me so much that I ended up purchasing a physical copy halfway through so that I can reread it and put sticky tabs in it.Something I think that makes this book very special is that as a white queer person, I've obviously had a very different experience from the author. But this is one of those books that shows you that there's also always so much you have in common with people, there's always so much more common ground than you might think at first. So this book both taught me a lot about other people's life experiences, as well as helped me understand myself better.One note is that I didn't understand why the author's trans cousin needed to be deadnamed and misgendered in the text.

All Boys Aren’t Blue reads like a transcript of his loving and supportive conversations with a younger cousin or nephew: I don’t have to be confined to an identity that boxes me into a space where I have to choose one or the other. To do so would just reward the homophobia. I can be good at football and double Dutch. I am actually still very good at football and double Dutch. But most importantly, I’m not bound by either of them. You don’t have to be either. (Kindle 735) Of course, many of the issues Johnson discusses are also ones that allies or other teens will profit from considering, as they may have had similar experiences or know people who have. Can you play basketball and also love science, for example? Most of us have to find ways to resolve such difficult apparent dichotomies. How can you handle bullying or your grandmother's illness? This is not only a book for Black, queer teens.Johnson sometimes spoke in hyperbole or perhaps he was ill-informed. For example, Johnson claimed to have invented the word Honeychild, a word that caused many problems at his elementary school, only to later be appropriated by mainstream culture. This didn’t match my memory of the word, so I did an Ngram search, which showed Honeychild first found in published books in 1910, then increasingly often after 1940. Honey child (two words) was first used in published books in 1827. Bad Company recorded their song by this name in 1976. Johnny Williams recorded his song in 1966. Maybe Johnson meant that he independently discovered the word. I don’t think this distinction – he invented it or invented it locally – is nit-picky. When we talk to children and teens about difficult things, we need to be careful to be honest and avoid making ourselves look bigger than we are. (We often look plenty big.)Symbolism gives folks hope. But I’ve come to learn that symbolism is a threat to actual change—it’s a chance for those in power to say, “Look how far you have come” rather than admitting, “Look how long we’ve stopped you from getting here.” (Kindle 843)Isn't this a lovely cover? In a world of inappropriate, inaccurate covers, this one fits.I've seen different pronouns used for Johnson (he/his? them/their?); he also referred to himself as Matt, but is published here as George M. He is currently describing himself as male and queer, but did not identify (at the time of publication) as non-binary or trans.Show more"

In general, I’m glad this book exists because I’m sure it will help many people who just need the representation and relatability that Johnson provides in sharing his story. But I didn’t walk away from All Boys Aren’t Blue feeling like I knew Johnson personally (something I think is critical for a memoir). It’s also in need of better editing - the chapters are not chronological but should be since I found myself getting confused, explaining details like the nickname of a cousin member is repeated unnecessarily across chapters, and Johnson hits you over the head explaining the obvious “point” of his stories instead of letting readers draw their own conclusions, or getting them to his greater meaning more gracefully. The writing style also feels awkward for a memoir - the medium is inherently personal, but should still connect with a wide audience. I think a few chapters in here work, but the majority seem more relevant as personal letters to family members or journal entries written out before a therapy session. The writing here feels like it would be meaningful for people who already love Johnson, but not really for readers who don’t know him. The chapters didn’t stand on their own as short stories, but there also was no natural arc or tension to bind the stories together. What was the point of this - to explore the lasting impact of trauma? The connections of family? Redefinitions of queerness within Black families? All of these totally interesting themes were brought up for a millisecond at a time, but there was no takeaway that the book fleshed out at length.Show more"

Stories like this need to be told, and this one was told in an extremely raw way. I connected with it on many levels. That said, the letters to people didn’t work for me; it felt awkward alternating between letters and the narrative sometimes. And while I loved many of the author’s hot takes, there were a couple about sexuality/gender identity that I’m not sure I completely agree with, personally. There was also a chapter that continuously misgendered and deadnamed a family member, which felt odd and a bit tone deaf to me. But of course I didn’t know this person myself, so maybe they were more fluid with pronouns and names than the chapter insinuated. Still, it made me uncomfortable when reading, something that shocked me because Johnson seems very self aware. Other parts of the novel will make readers uncomfortable, and good— they should!

All Boys Aren't Blue examines a lot of topics through stories from Johnson's life, and I think Johnson did a very good job of bringing it together for a young reader and writing a memoir-manifesto that he could have used earlier in his life. There was great care put into making sure it was accessible to young readers--treating the teen audience fairly, but also acknowledging places where things might seem to be normalized, but should not be.

This one was recently brought up at a Dublin School board meeting as being ""pornographic"" and it ironically became available for me through Libby same day! So I started it immediately and honestly, I thought it was kind of boring. Where is the porn? Now I am finished and I am just angry. ANGRY! As a mom, this book is important. This book is not pornographic in any way. There are two chapters in this book that have sexual content: one chapter he is sexually molested by an older family member and the second is when he loses his virginity AT 20 YEARS OLD! How many kids wait until they are 20? This is what he said in that chapter regarding CHOOSING to have sex for the first time instead of being coerced or manipulated: “it was the first time I was sharing my body with someone on my terms. I felt agency at that moment.” I repeat, this is an important book for teens who may be questioning their identity and their sexuality, and trying to understand what it means to fully give consent. Fidning out who you are and what you like and being ok with saying no or that you dont like something. We teach this to our straight kids, why is it porn when we are talking about queer teens? How the ef is this porn? He goes on to add: “My greatest fear is that queer teens will be left to trial and error in their sexual experience.” And that too is my greatest fear for my own kids. I want them armed to the teeth about sex, protection, birth control, consent, etc. Don't we also want that for LGBTQIA+ kids? FFS. This one angers me. That board member who brought this up, did she even read this or did she take the sexual encounters out of context? I WOULD love for my kids to read this book. This one is not the one to ban. Period.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 3 out of 5,"November 18, 2021",10 likes,0,"Before I review, let me note that I am about as far away from the intended audience of this YA memoir you can get. 	This book should be in every high school library and classroom library. It is an important book. It is a needed book.	Johnson’s memoir detail their growing up in New Jersey and coming to terms with self - as a Black queer boy. It’s true that the book is graphic in places – Johnson writes of their rape and their loss of virginity. (honesty if you think writing about being abused is porn, you need help). It’s also true that Johnson seems to anticipate the calls to ban the book that some people have voiced. They make it clear why they are relating such events in such away.  (Johnson says the targeted age for the book is 14-18).	More importantly, and the reason why it should readily accessible to students, in particular queer students of color, is that though honesty and, sometimes, bluntness, Johnson showcases the struggle of identity and the importance of expecting oneself. And this important because there are not enough memoirs for queer young adults, queer young adults of color especially. This book is needed. Without a doubt this book is needed. Johnson’s openness and bluntness are needed because it shows queer students that they are not alone in wrestling with serious questions. 	Because of their relative openness and bluntness, Johnson is able to speak to the reader. There is no sugar coating, and difficulty topics – such as abuse and losing one’s virginity - are addressed in such away that are not preachy or pornographic or anything like, but almost like a way passing done knowledge over how to deal with - emotionally and for one self’s – such issues. There should be such raw honesty about such issues. Furthermore, considering how sex ed is taught or in some cases not taught, it is important that Johnson wrote about sex, thus allowing students to gain knowledge, knowledge that they might have been denied access to or been to frightened to ask about.	It’s possible to think after reading this book that Johnson wrote this book, this way because such a thing was not available to them while growing up, and they went to ease the path for others. 	It is an important and needed book.	It is, however, in terms of sentences and some other issues not a great book. While Johnson’s bluntness is needed, the sentences and paragraphs too many times need to be fixed. If you look over the Goodreads reviews, several reviewers point out that Johnson tells as opposed to shows. The reason for this might be that allows for a greater connection to the reader, fair enough. But the wording in several paragraphs is downright bad. For instance, one review pointed out that Johnson claimed to have invented the term “honey child”. After reading this review, I went and re-read the passage. The passage is worded in such a way that reader can easily see it as Johnson taking credit for the term. It is interesting that they only mentions their sister in passing – while this is undoubtedly due to the age difference it does stand out as no reason is given. Sometimes when Johnson lets facts drop – like how they were the only child to go to an expensive private school in the family. I wanted a little more awareness of how this might have affected their relationship with their family. Additionally for a book that in part challenges the societal idea of masculine and male, the text at times seems to endorse it, not shocking when it is teen Johnson’s experiences, but a bit strange when adult Johnson is speaking. Perhaps these last two criticisms are unfair for a young adult memoir. The unclear meaning in passages, however, is not.Yet, despite the flaws, this is a very important book. It is a book that should be accessible to students. It should be read. Honesty, if you are person who believes this book should not be accessible, my first thought about you is that you want teens to commit suicide. I am glad Johnson wrote this book. I know a student who will get so much out it. And yes, I am passing it on.(Note – some will have noticed that I use they/them pronoun when referring to Johnson while the biographical information on the book flap and the book description use the he/his pronoun They/them seems to be Johnson’s preferred pronoun as of this review’s writing.)Show more"

Even more so because this is my first DNF EVERI couldn’t get past the first section of the book (there’s 4 or 5) I read up to 20% of the book and gave up I understand this is the authors life but the writing was not good. As a Black queer person myself I just feel this book wasn’t radical in its story telling enough for me. The writing wasn’t good and at most corny. There was a constant shallow analysis of society that I couldn’t see pass. Overall ye I’m glad I tried with it but this book isn’t for me and I don’t even think it’s radical enough for it to have been banned the way it was. There’s so much more Black queer literature that is way more radical and talks to and reaches out to Black queer people SPECIFICALLY. This is just not one of those books. The author knew their audience (non Black and non queer ) here, and by the “success” of this book I see their audience really showed up. Sadly I’m just not in that number 😕Show more"

Those are always my favorite listens because it just gives you that little something extra. At the same time, I feel like I need a physical copy so I can go ahead and highlight basically the whole book.Through Johnson's experiences of Blackness and queerness—both good and bad—his essays are an exploration of identity and all that comes with that: gender, sexuality, and race; family, friends, and strangers; love, loss, and ultimately, finding oneself in the world.I'll just leave you with George's words:""The real question we must ask ourselves each and every day is: am I willing to swim? Or is this the day that you drown? Many times the decision will be in our own hands. Sadly though, in a world that continues to kill Black queer people every day, that decision isn't always ours to make. But I swim anyway. Every single morning, I put on my goggles and dive right into the deep end of racism, homophobia, and every other oppression that is thrown my way. ""There don't seem to be enough Little Ralls, Rasuls, and Nannys willing to reach their hand into the water to pull us to safety. Too many watch in silence while others in the community suppress Black queer people.

These are important stories that George M Johnson is telling through this memoir, and while I couldn't understand or relate to a few of them, I could still feel the intent behind every word, the emotion and heart that went into writing this and the power that this book carries. This is definitely going to be one of those books that I will revisit, over and over, because I want to understand this experience even if I cannot relate to it. I was moved to tears at many places, despite everything. I'm not Black, but I am queer. I've not experienced loss the same way, but I have experienced it, nonetheless. And underneath it all, I'm just a girl trying to find her footing in the world. Maybe these lessons weren't written with me in mind, but I found some pearls to tuck away into my heart anyway and for that, I am grateful. More than anything, I'm glad this book is out there for those who need it more than me, for those who experience Blackness and queerness in a way I never have. For those who have wanted themselves to be seen. I don't really have a lot to say that isn't clichèd nonsense and rambly words, so I'll stop now. But, please pick this book up if you're able!

The book will do so valuable for young queer teens to see themselves and to learn about their community. The manifesto part, in my opinion, is about this core message to the kids and teens - I see you, you matter, here are some guidelines for you to navigate the racist cisheteronormative world.My favorite parts were about Hope, Nanny and the college experiences. George M. Johnson has such a wonderful family, it was a pleasure to meet them via text.I will be looking into more published works by George M. Johnson. They’ve written articles in various magazines (according to info from About the author part), this book is their debut novel.The only reason it’s not a five star read for me is because YA vibe and me have not been on a same wave line.

This really speaks to the entire content of the book. George M. Johnson writes their story about growing up as a Black queer boy, the intersection of these two core identities, how this impacted their upbringing, and why they ultimately decided to write this book. At the beginning of this book, Johnson quotes Toni Morrison: ""If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it."" Of course there have been plenty of Black trans/queer figures throughout time, but I think that Johnson's book added a lot of beautiful discussion on these intersecting identities.I'd have to say that my favorite aspect of this book was the family dynamics. Johnson writes with so much love for their family. You can't help but grow to love these people as much as the author does. This book displayed a (mostly) healthy dynamic between a family and their LGBT relatives. When issues arose from family members, Johnson would criticize their families preconceived notions in an empathetic and nuanced way. I really think that this book, while the obvious intention is to be a guiding book for younger LGBT people, is really a love story to Johnson's family.Now this is a memoir intended for a younger audience, and while I find that it mostly succeeded at that, there were a few issues I found within this book. First, the positive. This book would absolutely be useful for LGBT teens. (Of course, people outside of the community would benefit from this reading experience, but this is the main target audience.) Within the writing, Johnson comes across as a trustworthy, kind, and knowledgable individual. They never talk down to the reader, and frame their life in an extremely honest way. In one chapter, even discussing the abuse they experienced from their cousin while not leaving important (and natural) feelings that arose in them during the experience. By no means is the depiction of sex in this book graphic, in fact, I find that this book is one of the most black and white examples of ""book that should not be banned"". Johnson depicts their sexual experiences in an educational way, teaching consent and that sex is okay as long as you're having fun and are being safe. I also really loved how the author discussed their gender confusion, and how, because they didn't have the full knowledge of queer and gender-nonconforming people, they believed that they were meant to be a woman. It goes to show that proper education on LGBT topics helps kids further understand themselves- not hinders.Now, I had only a few issues with this book. For one, while I understand the reasoning behind writing a memoir for a younger audience, I often find that a more complex view on the author's life can be left out due to trying to make the book easier to connect with for a younger audience. The other issue I had- which is a serious nitpick- is that at times certain words would be censored, and then others wouldn't. I failed to grasp the reasoning behind these editorial decisions. ""Faggot"" would be fully written out at times, and at others, censored. Maybe it was a contextual thing that I didn't pick up on, but I would have preferred all words be left uncensored. Overall, All Boys Aren't Blue is a heartwarming, and also educational story about growing up Black and queer. I deeply connected to the prose, and would recommend this to anyone looking to read about someone's unapologetic experience.

Trigger warning: Rape, Sexual Assault, Homophobia, Racism This memoir was powerful, raw and honest and i've learned so many new things from this and how i see things more differently than I did before and this book helped that. A memoir about a queer black guy growing up in a world where heterosexuality and hiding you were gay just to save yourself the relentless bullying and ridicule from everyone. George took me on this journey of self discovery and acceptance with learning how to be comfortable in your own skin and face any battle head on. For someone who's trying to learn more about a community and how to be a supportive ally is always something that i'm forever going to be growing and learning from but George really gave me an insight to what it's like being queer and also a black queer kid. I think having that supportive system around you wether it be family, friends or a group of people you can trust really does help you along the way. George's family shows a lot of this and it makes me extremly happy that he was able to have this support system around him to help him along the way on his journey. I had no idea what to expect when i decided to read this book but i'm really glad that I did because it really opened my eyes to how queer and especially queer people of colour are seen and how they have to deal with these issues growing up and in adult life.

I especially liked the insight into the family structure and intergenerational history as different chapters were dedicated to different key persons in the narrator’s life. It’s very personal and easy to get lost in, in a good way. I absolutely recommend this book, and especially because content warnings for slurs, descriptions of sexual assault, etc are explicitly given at the start of the book, which was very helpful and appreciated.I probably would have given it 5 stars if it hadn’t been for the, in my eyes, disrespectful treatment of the narrator’s trans cousin via the language used to describe her. She is deadnamed and misgendered multiple times, despite the narrator saying he now has a better understanding of transphobia and would never with this knowledge have misgendered and misnamed her, yet that is exactly what ends up happening in the narrative.In good faith, because I truly do love this book, I assumed that this use of language must have been approved by the affected person before the book came out, only to find out she tragically died years prior to this book being released. If this was language she was comfortable with, it at least isn’t specified in the book, which makes me uncomfortable because that is, as far as I’m aware, the only acceptable time to deadname and misgender a trans person: when they explicitly give you permission, for whatever reason. And even then, idk, tread lightly because it isn’t something to throw around to thousands of strangers. Because as far as I’m aware, allyship to trans people 101 is: don’t fucking use people’s deadnames, and don’t misgender them. I’d think this goes especially hard for published non-fiction that speaks to real lived experiences and reaches a large audience, and even more so in terms of people who can no longer defend themselves.This ordeal certainly left a bad taste in my mouth, but I enjoyed the rest of the book and its vulnerability and I would recommend it even though there are parts I disagree with.Show more"

He has a noble goal in mind - to send a message to young people that are struggling with sexual identity, coming out, marginalization in society - message, that this psychological struggle is at it’s worst only for a period - that once you pass fear of coming out, accepting and embracing your true self - there will be so many people that will accept and embrace you for exactly who you are and life will be a much brighter place once you have made that decision. Author’s life journey and all the inner struggles will resonate with practically every gay person - be you male, female, Black or white. When picking up this book in the library I was curious to find out what it is like to be a Black gay guy in the society and how different their paths and challenges can be compared to that of white queer folk. And the answer is - there is hardly any difference at all! Since that moment that you realize that you are “not like the rest” - your journey of self doubt, questioning, closeting, pretending begins, regardless either you are Black or White. A good, honest, brave voice - we need more of those to give hope and emotional support to those on journey of self discovery and self acceptance. Show more"

Samozřejmě to neznamená, že si tu knihu nemůžete přečíst, když nepatříte do skupiny, na kterou cílí, vlastně si naopak myslím, že byste si ji přečíst měli, protože dost pomáhá otevřít oči, lépe díky ní pochopíte, čím vším si musí projít někdo, kdo v USA žije jako černoch a gay k tomu všemu.Autor strašně dobře rozvádí téma genderu v naší společnosti, jak svazující je to škatulkování a stereotypy, které se jednotlivých genderů týkají. Otevřeně tu mluví o rasismu, homofobii, stejně tak tu otevřeně probírá sex a jak důležité je mladé lidi o něm vzdělat, obzvlášť když jste gay a ta šance pohlavně přenosných chorob je u vás podstatně vyšší. Musím upozornit, že se tu řeší i sexuální zneužívání, není příjemné o tom číst, tak na to pozor.U memoárů mám občas problém s tím, že mě úplně nebaví je číst, často jsou napsaný dost suše. Ale to případ téhle knížky fakt není, je vidět, že autor má na psaní velký talent a já proto hltala kapitolu za kapitolou.Celkově je tohle kniha plná úžasných myšlenek, která mi toho dost předala a připomněla mi, že si ještě mám v čem rozšiřovat obzory. Fakt, jestli se zajímáte o otázku genderu, sexuality či rasy, rozhodně se na tuhle knížku podívejte.Show more"

One that is ever changing as identities that were once in the dark come to light. As relationships that once needed to be hidden come to a place of greater visibility.""THIS BOOK. All Boys Aren't Blue is one of my favorite books I've read this year so far. George is honest, bold, and compassionate. There are so many good topics covered in this book, and I don't even really know what to say about it. I really like that the author talks about what he has learned instead of just cutting out the parts he doesn't like, and that's really admirable to me. This book is smart, gorgeous, and heartbreaking. I prefer to avoid books that I know are going to make me cry, but I had to read this one after seeing all the great reviews, and I don't remember the last time I bawled my eyes out over a book in this way.

But, here's what I can say...I think that George M. Johnson is brave for telling his story and I think that his mission to help other queer teens feel seen is unflinching and significant.It's important to listen to people who have experienced life differently. I think it's how we grow and how we can love, respect and accept people for who they are. I am grateful for the opportunity to be exposed to George's life and I'm hoping that the young people who would benefit from his story even more than I would, will have the opportunity to read his words.As far as the writing, there were a few redundancies and it felt like there could have been a bit more editing.

For this, I would indeed highly recommend. Particularly for young queer people (especially poc) or those who might be questioning, or friends/family of young queer people. On a personal level I wasn't always the biggest fan of the writing style/authorial voice in this - sometimes it felt like he was over-explaining things that didn't require it. Basically, point-blank telling us the message instead of letting the story tell us. But again - would still recommend! Very honest and vulnerable memoir about coming to terms with your own identity and what being queer means in conjunction with being Black, and the importance of a support system full of love, even if not always completely full of total understanding.

So much Blackness dripped in Queerness and it was everything. I loved this. Johnson has a very engaging and entertaining writing style. It’s casual and laidback and made reading through this a breeze because I didn’t want to stop reading. I feel inadequate in trying to write a review for this one. Just know that it was a great read that had me super emotional at parts. I hope this book will help be a wonderful guide for Black queer boys who feel lost and are struggling with themselves.

The issues of gender norms and the expectations they bring. Toxic masculinity. The negative seeds and conditions in the black community. I absolutely loved it.

All Boys Aren't Blue is part memoir, part manifesto, George M. Johnson tells their life story and reflects on the experiences he has had as a Black Queer person, and how those identities intersect.

I'm so glad a book like this exists for a young YA audience, I definitely related a lot with it at times and many others will as well.

Often times, experiences, wisdom, and useful information is kept away from young people because it's deemed ""too much"". This is harmful and does nothing to prepare them for the world they inhabit, where most of these things (sex, drugs, the attempted erasure of agency) do exist!This was a decent read for me.

Johnson's YA memoir includes many heavy topics and rating it feels weird.CW: racism and slurs, sexual assault, incest and rape, abuse, violence - blood, cancer, misgendering, deadnaming of a trans woman, death of family members and friends, homophobiaThis book was voted for as our February Book Club pick and I am so glad that this one won our vote. Certainly not targeted at me as a white (queer) person, I was still able to identify with some of the things Johnson wrote and I am sure that many others, no matter their gender, sexuality or skin colour can be reached. We discussed this in our book club and I would not be against making kids read this in school. For people who are not queer, Johnson explains in very simple words what it is like to be queer and how you can be an ally. However, what still bothers me greatly is the deadnaming and misgendering of Johnson's cousin. Johnson repeatedly writes out her deadname and uses wrong pronouns. There was no reason to repeatedly do so or do so at all. It is sad that this will only be extremely harmful for trans readers. I wanted to lend All Boys to a friend before, but have decided against it because I don't want them to get hurt. If this book ever gets read in school, this is a critical point that would have to be addressed... The last chapters  about the death of Kenny  made me cry. It reminded me of my former classmate, who was the kindest and most talented kid I've ever met but who died from cancer at the age of 19. I also had to think about my grandfather, whose birth- and death-day was 4 days ago. That in turn made me think of all the other funerals I already attended... the grief in this book is immense.

This is definitely a must-read for everyone. Johnson covers a lot of important topics in his work and they're ones that are often missing from the YA canon, which makes me all the more happy that this book is aimed at teens specifically. I honestly really enjoyed my reading experience with this one.

I thought that Johnson’s voice was well-executed throughout the text. I really enjoyed a lot of the commentaries that he made by recounting experiences from his own life. I found A LOT that I related to while reading this book, and there were also a lot of things that I couldn’t necessarily relate to, first-hand, yet I enjoyed the opportunity to read and better understand those experiences as well. The only 2 reasons I deducted .5 star are:1) I felt like there were times where Johnson “over-explained” a bit. I wish there was more room for the reader to theorize and come to terms with the themes of the experiences mentioned without it being handed to them on a silver platter. I wanted a bit more nuance with how Johnson chose to share his story. (I do understand that this is marketed toward YA readers, and I get that that’s likely the reason that Johnson was so straightforward, but it didn’t work for me... for obvious reasons.)2) I felt that the last little bit of the book dragged a bit. The reason I felt this way is because I felt the main concept for the theme of this book was meandering a bit toward the end. There were parts included that I felt didn’t need to be discussed, or could’ve been discussed at a briefer length because of the (to me) irrelevance to the main idea of the book. I really SLUDGED through the last 50 pages or so after FLYING through the first 250ish. Regardless of my negative feelings toward those parts of the book, I did THOROUGHLY enjoy it overall. I think it would be a great book for ANYONE to read, but namely Black, LGBTQ+ people. I think that this book will be such an amazing resource for so many teens!

His stories are told like a mentor talking to a mentee, an older brother to a younger sibling. Because of that, it's a great book for queer youth, especially queer Black youth, looking for something to feel less alone. My only hang-ups are that he goes out of his way to explain the point of each story and really beat you over the head with the messages he's trying to portray. I really wished he let his stories do the talking and focused more on the story-telling in general. Young adults aren't stupid. They can think for themselves and figure out what you want to say without everything spelled out for them. I can understand wanting the message clearly understood, but it doesn't have to be told so plainly that it takes away from the stories. I was also thrown real fast into George's sexual experiences him being molested by his cousin, the assault in his high school bathroom, and his consensual experiences in college without any warning and it was triggering. The fact I had to dig for a review with trigger warnings is also kinda upsetting, but it is what it is. Despite this one thing, I would absolutely recommend it.Show more"

We got to see George's life from childhood to adulthood, his inner struggles with himself and with society. I think my favorite part of the book is that his support system took me by surprise. When you're ""different"" and belong in the ""minority"", things aren't looking up for you. Yet, I didn't see much of this in this book. And I was happy about it, but I'm also sad, knowing that not everyone was as lucky as the author was. Still, I loved his story. I loved that he went and shared it with us and it opened my eyes in a way I didn't expect it. I'm sure this will be very educational for others who are not as open minded as I am.

I thought this was a great memoir and I would definitely recommend the audiobook.

Here are the quotes that I wrote down (there won't be page numbers because I listened to this, but most of these are from the first half of the book):  ""The spectrum of our traumas can be as broad as our identities."" ""That being different didn't mean something was wrong with me, but that something was wrong with my cultural environment.""""No amount of money, love, or support can protect you from a society intent on killing you for your blackness."" ""Trauma becomes the thing that bonds us together."" ""People being allowed to be called by their chosen names and their gender pronouns is the rule."" ""We aren't allowed to live as we are in the culture that we continue to shape and create. We get to watch those who oppress us use our content with none of the repercussions that we face.""""Adults who participate in homophobia create kids who do the same. Homophobia denies queer people happiness."" ""Navigating in a space that questions your humanity isn't really living at all. It's existing. We all deserve more than just the ability to exist. """"I don't have to be confined to an identity that boxes me into a space where I have to chose one or the other."" ""You sometimes don't know you exist until you realize someone like you existed before."" ""American history is truly the greatest fable ever written."" ""The interesting thing about studying history is how much it beings to change based on the school setting and who was teaching it.""""..my parents taught me early how you have to behave so that you don't end up a statistic."" I think this book can help MANY queer teenagers feel more comfortable in their own skin and realize that they are not alone.

That quote and this entire memoir just... hit me square in the chest. I'm probably going to be screaming about All Boys Aren't Blue forever. It was touching and subtle, but also never shied away from the tough topics, of which there are several. It was beautifully written, and told (and performed by the author on the audiobook) -- and really got to the heart of so many issues. So many gorgeous quotes, so many important pieces.Johnson explored a perspective and a life that is so underrepresented -- writing about what it means to be Black and queer and gender non-conforming, and what it means to be all of these things at once. How it is to feel like the different parts of your identity clash; to be accepted by one community for a certain part of you but not for the others, and vice versa. But also, what it means to finally find your people who accept you for your entire being.This isn't going to be a long one, because a) reviewing memoirs is different and b) I don't really want to go in to all of my personal connections to the narrative here. But I do want to give this my highest recommendation, and say please read this book. If you're interested in memoirs, or even if you're not: please read this book.Show more"

He’s very intentional about telling his story in a way that it benefits those coming after him, which I thought was incredibly generous. He’s obviously uncomfortable telling his own story at times, nervous to lay bare the intensely personal details of his young life, but he’s able to push past the awkwardness because he often felt alone growing up and wants to spare other kids feeling the same way. The prose is simple and accessible as you’d expect from a YA memoir; Johnson doesn’t get in his own way and relates both events and insights straightforwardly. He’s good at telling the good with the bad—his life has been difficult at times and he’s struggled to fit in, but his family is supportive and he writes about them with such love and affection (especially his wonderful grandmother). This is the kind of book I imagine queer adults wish they had when they were growing up, and I’m really glad it exists.Show more"

On how we box people into being certain ways because of how society dictates they should be behaving. How queerness and blackness aren't given a fair chance to intersect and how vital is it that they must, for the sake of people safely being themselves.In a world where I see positive change every single day, there is still so much work to be done for Black people and for the LGBTQIAP+ community.

The book is the author's memoir of growing up black and queer, and as a positive, such an exploration was at least an interesting opportunity to think about my own childhood and the surprising similarlities and disimilarities.But as a contribution to the now-staggering amount of queer writing, this was painfully mediocre. The author is a middle-class American from a relatively wealthy and stable family, who had multiple queer and accepted/accepting family members, had university paid for partially by scholarship and by family, where they joined a frat and became its president. Nothing to be ashamed of, but hardly tragic or noteworthy. But they're aware that there's some cultural caché to be gained by fitting their experience into a particular paradigm. So despite their experiences being rather banal, they try to invoke intersectionality, microaggression, trauma, etc. For example, the first chapter begins with the author discussing how they weren't sure about their gender when they were young (“I used to daydream a lot as a little boy. But in my daydreams, I was always a girl”), and then suddenly switches to how they got jumped along with two older cousins by a group of fellow kids and had their teethed kicked in. Traumatic for sure, and we can certainly feel empathy for this. But the author then reflects:I think back on that day a lot. I wish I knew what motivated the attack. Could it have been because I was effeminate? Could it have been a race thing, since the main assaulter was a white boy from a different part of the neighborhood? Could it have simply been the toxic behaviors we teach boys about fighting and earning manhood? I know that impact and intent always play a role, so even if their intent wasn’t those things, the impact would forever change me anyway.ok but the incident itself had nothing to with sexuality or race directly - the other group was mixed race, and the author wasn't even the instigating target- it was the older cousins' argument that got out of hand. But the author still desperately tries to make it a story about race and sexuality, to try to appropriate a seeminly random act of violence to fit a narrative. There's also a weird misuse of the impact/intent disctinction - of course understanding intent of an attack clarifies its nature: was it a hate crime or reckless but arbitrary violence? To suggest that only ""impact"" matters in this context where readers are trying to understand the nature of the attack makes no sense at all.The author is also obsessively attached to a very superficial language of authenticity - either things are repressed and therefore inauthentic, or open and therefore authentic. The point isn't that the language of authenticity is never appropriate, it's just that it's a very blunt instrument. The chapter where they describe joining a frat is a good example of what the language of authenticity hides. The author mentions that one of the reasons they wanted to join a frat at all was that it was a way of appearing/performing/enacting masculinity:Masculinity—better yet, my lack of it—was always at the forefront of my mind. Joining a fraternity seemed like a win-win situation. The fraternities were built on principles of masculinity. Lawrence’s frat had “Aims,” which were “manly deeds, scholarship, and love for all mankind.” Manly stuck out to me. It was a stark contrast to the femininity that the sororities presented...For me, a fraternity meant gaining the one thing I so longed to have: a masculine ideal attached to me.We also get a stark sign that that this is not simply about aesthetics or personal authenticity, but also about power and pecking order in how new frat members chant at their induction: WE ARE GEORGE MATTHEW JOHNSON. WE ARE FROM PLAINFIELD, NEW JERSEY. WE ARE A FINANCE MAJOR WITH A 3.3 GPA. OUR LINE NAME IS KHALFANI, WHICH MEANS KING AND RULER. BECAUSE ALPHAS HAVE ALWAYS RUN THIS YARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO RUN THIS YARD. And yet, instead of trying to reckon openly about the politics of these social arrangements, the author just points to how their family was present at the induction and cheering, dully making it about authenticity again:I felt seen, not in terms of my sexuality, but in the sense that I was now at the top of a Black societal pyramid for once. I was no longer the kid worried about being picked last. I was no longer being forced into something masculine as a way to protect myself. I was defining my own masculinity. I was the center of attention for a good reason. People were rooting for me.A more searching book might have noted at this point that this use of personal authenticity simply isn't a very good tool - there are always complex calculations and identifications, each with not just advantages but also trade-offs and blindnesses. So instead of obsessing over who you identify *as*, it's just as important to think seriously about who you're identifying *with* and who you're not identifying with (eg: the vast majority of non-frat students who presumably are not alpha enough to ""run this yard""). The author certainly has mentions of famous Black and queer Americans peppered throughout, but simply vaguely gesturing at queer and black people in the past doesn't make a community. That the author can aesthetically fit their masculinity with their frat's is interesting enough, but this is still a system of regulating gender! The chapter right after the one about the one joining the frat, the author describes their first time topping and bottoming. But when mentioning this, they add:I also wanted to try the bottom position, which I associated with being the more submissive person. (Though if you know me, that ain’t ever been me.) Why the need to dismiss submissiveness? I would suggest that perhaps that the author hasn't liberated themself as much as found a way of combining social prestige and dominance with queer blackness. Seen this way, it's a book about how with enough money and masculinity, you too can enter a powerful elite. Which is something, but not much. The only people more embarassing than those heaping laurels on it are the American states who banned it.I think we're well past the time where anything written by queer people of colour should be considered valuable simply for existing, it's about time we insist people actually have something to say.Show more"

So much was sugar-coated. The honey child thing had me questioning the truth in many other passages. I do not want to diminish anyone's struggles, but this was not a biography that I would lift up as a great example for those dealing with trauma or questioning. Listening to the audio with them reading it made it feel even weirder. As someone who dealt with and survived familial sexual trauma, the way this was told was not a way that would help someone find help if they are in the same situation. I wanted to DNF, but I was hoping it would come around to a reason that made sense. I think we all deal with trauma differently, and obviously, this author deals with it by making themself a larger-than-life character in their life...As a white mother of a mixed child who doesn't look like they have a white mother, there were may insinuations in this book that I would be unable to raise my black son properly.... So that was fun to read about as well. This was one of the weirdest judgmental books about everyone else who did anything differently from them.

Not okay.Overall they have a story to tell, and if you dig in, some bits of wisdom and feels can be found, but this could have used a better editor to help shape (and research) the stories being told for a more accurate emotional and respectful read.I seem to be in the minority though so if you have read this tell me what you think.Show more"

It gives you empathy for a life lived differently than yours.

He is attempting to EDUCATE others and let queer folk know they are NOT alone. With that being said, they are some graphic details and explicit sex scenes, BUT he addresses them with kindness and understanding. Most importantly, before starting his story he provides a trigger warning statement that lets his readers know exactly what topics are discussed in his memoir. If these will upset the reader, they know and can stop reading before they even start the book. ""All Boys Aren't Blue"" is and should always be a Young Adult book.

In this biographical essay, George M. Johnson shares his experience on being a black, queer boy in the United States and how he had to find himself before coming out to his family and friends many years later. While I do not relate to this very specific part of his life, this book covers much more than sexual identity or gender -Johnson discusses friendship, grief, love, death, trauma (including sexual abuse), and forgiveness, and all this is what makes this story special. In the end, the author shows how complicated we can be as human beings and the daily challenges we most overcome in our lives. The writing was touching, and the author was able to convey all kinds of emotions without falling into clichés nor self-pity. This book can be truly inspiring, regarding your sexual preference or identity. __Este es el recuento personal de un activista de la comunidad LGBTQ+ que sin duda resonará entre el público de jóvenes adultos y que puede enseñarnos una cosa o dos o personas más grandes como yo. En ese ensayo autobiográfico, George M. Johnson comparte su experiencia sobre cómo fue crecer como afroamericano y queer en los Estados Unidos, y el camino recorrido antes de compartir su identidad con amigos y familia muchos años después. Si bien no me identifico con esta parte de su vida, el libro va más allá de la identidad de género: Johnson discute temas como la amistad, el dolor, el amor, la muerte, el trauma (incluido el abuso sexual), y el perdón, y todo abona a la construcción de un relato especial. El autor logra mostrar la complejidad de los seres humanos, y que no todo es blanco y negro, habiendo demasiados retos que tenemos que enfrentar y superar durante nuestra vida. La escritura me pareció emotiva y Johnson logra transmitir diversas emociones sin caer en clichés o en la autocompasión. Esta historia me parece inspiradora, sin importante la preferencia o identidad sexual. Show more"

It's incredibly important and truthful, and as much as it was a bit simplistic I recommend you buy it for every young adult in your life.
Love who you want to love and do it unapologetically, including that face you see every day in the mirror.
George M. Johnson discusses their identity in a series of moments throughout their life. From the foreshadowing mix up of their birth to their first experiences with violence, from racism to black love, from the strength of family to the confusing difficulties of finding yourself.The writing was simple and easy to understand. Sometimes it veers into over-explaining its points, but I understand the need to put across the point in a way that readers will understand. It would have been an amazing book for me to have read as a young adult when I needed to hear people speak about their experiences with queerness. Some parts are difficult to read, but the topics are important, especially for young adults who are often left out of these difficult conversations.
Unfortunately, my life story is proof that no amount of money, love, or support can protect you from a society intent on killing you for your Blackness.
Despite understanding why the writing was straightforward it contributed to a feeling that this book wasn't really for me. I've spent a lot of my adult life discussing similar points to the book, so it didn't add much to my understanding, despite enjoying learning more about George M. Johnson. It feels very much like the beginning of a conversation, and that's not what I need, but it is why it's such a good memoir for young adults.I can't critique the content of the book because this is a personal experience about their life. The only thing I wish was expanded upon more was the discussion of fraternities. I understand why joining a frat was a key moment in their life, but as there have been many discussions in other media surrounding how frats often reinforce misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, etc. I wish there had been more of a critical view of it. At the same time, I'm not from the U.S. so I don't understand frat culture generally.
I got to live in my totality and, for the first time ever, exist as both Black and queer in the same space and be loved for it, not shamed.
Overall this is an amazing memoir that can greatly impact the lives of young adults as it brings up discussions they need to be included in. I'm so glad this was written, and I'm happy teenagers now will have access to books as brilliant as this oneShow more"

All Boys Aren't Blue
 is George M. Johnson's memoir manifesto, in which he shares his experiences as Black queer boy and then adult.However, despite the important references to a society and an education system mostly built around and for white, straight (and may I add, male) people, and the struggle of a boy trying to find himself and fit in this badly constructed society, this book is so much more. Because it deals with pain, loss, abuse, but also with the small occurrences of happiness in everyone's life and the importance of family and friendship.Honestly, I took my time reading this, because it very frequently teared me up, literally and figuratively, but always ended up instilling in me a deep hope that something's started changing.I applaud George M. Johnson for being brave enough to write such a thought-provoking and important book, in a way that emphasizes that in the end of the day, you define who you want to be and what makes you happy.Plus, the precious artwork on the cover, with the teary eyes on such a confident face... It will make me cry all over again...Content warnings: sexual assault, molestation, homophobia, racism, substance abuse, cancer, death, depressionShow more"

There's no way to rate any person's story. And yeah, I could go on about how much I liked the writing, but it would shift away from what is important. First, I have to say that this book touches on several tough topics, so please have a look beforehand. CW: racism and slurs, sexual assault, incest, rape, abuse, violence, blood, cancer, death (of family members and friends), misgendering and deadnaming of a trans person, homophobia.We chose this book as the February Buddy Read for our University book club, and it coincidentally fit well with Black History Month. This story hit differently. I'm happy that we read it. Even though it's certainly not targeted at me, I was still able to identify and reflect on some of the things Johnson wrote. And I'm sure many will, too. Some of the book club members discussed the possibility of reading this book in school. It would be a great introduction to many queer topics, with appropriate caution, and I can definitely agree. There have been several chapters that emotionally touched me, especially the last. Johnson's story is definitely not an easy ride, and I was shocked and left without words more time than I can count. As the author said, ""Whether this book is a bestseller or a flop, if one person is helped by my story, then it was all worth it."", I also believe that these stories will help others, as some might have even been through the same experiences. I also want to point out something that friends thankfully pointed out to me too. The author repeatedly deadnames his trans cousin and uses the wrong pronouns. It further complicates and makes this book uncomfortable for trans readers. I will not go into more details about the book here. But I'll end this review with a quote that is as sad as it is beautiful.""Time and Death are much closer than many of us would ever like them to be. [...] Time waits for no one, and for Black queer people, there are too many trying to steal the little bit of time we have. So, live your life.""Show more"

All Boys Aren’t Blue is a memoir-manifesto by journalist and LGBTPQIA+ activist George M. Johnson. They talk about their life from early childhood to young adult and explore topics such as family, agency, and Black joy. This is a powerful and, at times, heart wrenching book. It is thought provoking and deeply moving and is definitely something I’m going to continue thinking about for a long time.This book will help so many people. It was crafted with such thought and care. There are many topics explored in this book that have the potential to be triggering, but Johnson talks about them all in their author’s note at the beginning of the book, so that you are prepared before starting.They also bring up the fact that some of these things may be seen as “too heavy” for teenagers, but that all of these heavy topics happened to them as a child, teenager and young adult. Children and teenagers, unfortunately, have to navigate some pretty awful things sometimes and Johnson wants those readers to have the space to be seen and heard in their pages.Definitely go pick up a copy today, you won’t regret it!

There is an overwhelming narrative that suggests that Black families are homophobic and toxic - which is a narrative that pervades any discourse around the experiences of Black and Queer people. And while it cannot be denied that there is a lot of hate rooted in ignorance, THAT IS NOT THE ONLY STORY! It’s beautiful to read about a Black family that moves with love and care. It was such a breathe of fresh air to have a story that centers Black family life and shows it in a positive light. What comes across in this book is how important family and community is to the self. How much of who we become - and how we become who we are is tied to our experiences of family and community. I wish every Black and Queer child had the unflinching and unconditional support that George describes here. We all deserve that.💕Reading this reminded me so much of my own family. The love that exists in the Johnson family is apparent on every page. Nanny in particular reminds me so much of my maternal grandmother. It really struck me when George said “Nanny won’t win any awards from GLAAD...bur because she saw me, I get the chance to tell everyone about her”. I think of my own grandmother who was widowed young and managed to raise 5 Black girls during the height of Apartheid...and how her love and care has produced women in my family who move through the world with heart and care. So many seemingly small actions by Black women who will never get the accolades - have has lasting and rippling effects. How their love has shifted cultures and influenced generations.

One that is ever changing as identities that were once in a dark come to light. As relationships that once needed to be hidden come to a place of greater visibility.”This powerful line perfectly encapsulates this book. A memoir, or memoir manifesto as George M. Johnson calls it, All Boys Aren’t Blue tells Johnson’s journey and his experiences navigating the world as a Black queer person. It’s a beautiful, reflective piece that touches on Blackness, queerness, family and masculinity, sewn together in a short, easy to read YA memoir. Johnson’s story is unique yet universal, and in chapters that are structured first with a story and then with a lesson, this book will speak to and help YA audiences, specifically queer and Black YA audiences, to wrestle with their identity. It accomplished exactly what Johnson set out to do, and for that he deserves incredible praise.However, while I did enjoy this book, I must say that I, personally, struggled at times. I think that I would have loved this book in high school. I would have seen elements of myself in it, elements that I didn’t want to see. It would have been life changing. But now, as a 22-year-old man who is confident in his identity, it wasn’t. It wasn’t a revolutionary text for me, and that’s FINE, because it will be for so many young queer Black kids. It’s meant for a high school audience and for people who are trying to dig deeper into their own and other’s identities. Therefore, while this book isn’t one of my personal favorites, this book’s impact cannot be ignored. I thought the writing was fine and in a very YA style, which i like. It was easy to read and easy to love, but I did find myself at times wanting more description or expansion on ideas.Overall, it’s a great book that I do think is relatable regardless of age, but it will really hit home with high school kids. It accomplishes exactly what Johnson wanted it to, and he shows queer Black kids that the world is harsh and tough, but that they can get through whatever challenge comes their way.Show more"

Not an easy book to read (and not because it's impenetrable or poorly written, because the prose is clear as a bell) and not a fun book and not light reading. But worth reading.Many of us appreciate all of those studies that remind us that reading fiction, yup, novels, teaches us empathy ... and, if the last five or six years have reminded us of anything, it's that we (as a society) could use (frankly) a lot more empathy ... and memoirs such as this do so too, but the cost (to the author, to the readers) seems far greater.

But I've been trying to broaden my perspective on related issues for a while (yeah, we all have to start somewhere), and, like many others, I bought the book because it was increasingly popping up on banned book lists (which, historically, seem to spur sales, which does beg the question ... ah, but I digress....). In that context, I'm glad the author made a few pennies from my purchases and, if increased sales lead others (particularly those in the intended audience) to read it, so much the better.

Most importantly, I knew the road that lay ahead of me, with many obstacles to cross and barriers to beak down. And although I had lived a full life, I knew there was still a lot more life that I needed to live."" This was a powerful an deeply personal read as George reflects back on their exploration of intersectionality, happiness, masculinity, trauma, sexuality and grief on their journey through learning their identity and what it means to them. George writes their story in the hopes it can become a source of comfort, support and inspiration to readers to be unapologetically you.George opens their narrative discussing how society has become overly reliant on assigning gender, create boxes, labels and pathways that are too rigid so that kids that fit neither are left lost and questioning, throughout the book they work on how this effected them. It was incredible to think how little five-year-old George, already knowing they were different, having the burden of hiding that as it wasn't accepted to be feminine or like boys and growing up masking themselves and always having to choose what part to hide and what part to hide it with to stay safe and ""happy"". George was constantly hounded throughout their youth being asked if they were gay, a question that influenced their struggle with their identity in trying to appear masculine but still being seen as feminine as well as the question itself removing their own agency to be the one to ""come out"" on their own terms.Reading how they navigated throughout years of school, code-switching between their feminine side and appearing masculine, not only to protect themselves but those associated with them, George's statement that queer people go through a second adolescence makes a lot of sense. How, throughout years of queer children suppressing themselves during early formative years and the lack of education in sex education, individuals find themselves growing and learning for the second time in adulthood as they come out of this self-suppression. George opens up vulnerable parts of their identity in the hopes to help younger queer people as they discuss their own sexual exploration, figuring things out where education severely lacked. They also discuss the effects of suppression and toxic masculinity creating a cycle of abuse and trauma, how a victim becomes an abuser, thus creating the next victim. George describes the process of guilt, anger, fear and tragedy, it's a hard chapter to read, but needed for the process of learning, unlearning and understanding trauma. George explores their intersectionaly as a Black and Queer person, reflecting on the joy, pain, tragedy and triumph in showing both the privileges and the oppressions they have experienced as a result, from lack of visibility in the media and history being ""truly the greatest fable"" to the love and support of family. George describes the different climates in different schools, jumping from predominantly Black schools to predominantly white and back again. Learning from a young age white history glossed over the truths, that white historical figures were praised equally to Black historical figures masking what they had done (like have slaves etc etc). George continues to repeat throughout their narrative to question everything with gaps or doesn't feel right, to do your own research and find your own answers if they're not given. Find your truth to help understand who you are and where you came from in history. I loved George's family that was a dominant force in their life and the narrative, especially Nanny. I loved her and I loved how George's family may not have understood their queer family members at the time (because of lack of info!) but they were all their to support and recognise the signs in George and keep them safe and happy. Learning about cousin Hope was touching, not only showing the love of family but also helping George ""You gave hope to me, living as the person you wanted to be, dying as the person you wanted to be... there is beauty in knowing that whichever way I go, I was here, and I left here being myself. A lesson I learned from you and your journey."" I was moved by the last few chapters focusing on the experience of grief, though focused on the death of a close friend, George also discusses the different perspectives of grief. They discuss the impact of the death of friends and family and also the grief of not being your authentic self, which they describe as slowly dying.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25777210-callum-mclaughlin,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 3 out of 5,"November 25, 2020",5 likes,0,"This is Johnson’s memoir, reflecting on his experiences as a young Black gay man growing up in America. The book encompasses many big themes, including queerness, family, identity, racism, abuse, and masculinity. I appreciated how frank and self-aware Johnson’s writing is. His commentary on the differences between sex and gender, and the coding of language, clothing and behaviour to uphold a strict binary and suppress queer expression is particularly excellent. The section which sees him write open letters to loved ones about the important roles they’ve played in his life is also very moving.Though I found his voice consistently engaging, I will say a couple of the anecdotes shared felt somewhat tenuously linked to the points Johnson was trying to make. This meant they paled in comparison to the power and effectiveness of the book’s more successful sections. Due to its essay-like structure, the book is also non-linear in a way that can leave it feeling as though it lacks a sense of overall direction at times.Queer youth (especially Black queer youth) will see so many of their own experiences reflected in Johnson’s work, and it’s great to know books like this will help the next generation feel less alone in their struggles.Show more"

The author draws on personal stories (some funny, some sad) as well as social and political critique in a way that was really thought-provoking. There are some particularly tough memories and trauma explored in this, but they're approached with vulnerability and clarity. He writes that when he was growing up, there was a lack of books and media that represented him, and his aim was to provide that for others through this memoir. I think this would be a great book for teens and adults alike, both those who want to see themselves represented with a loving embrace and allies who approach this with an open mind and heart, willing to bear witness and gain understanding. I loved reading about his experiences and family, especially Nanny, and the myriad of themes explored. (Also, I recommend the audiobook.

I would call this 3.5 stars rounded down. An important but flawed book. I think on balance, the world is a better place with this book in it. Authentic, honest stories from queer Black people need to be told and heard and this adds to their number. And I believe that many young people may find identity, solace, comfort, strength or the words to explain what they are feeling and who they are in this book.It is also absurd that reactionary conservatives are banning this book from school libraries. It is absolutely appropriate for the young adult/high school audience for whom it is written. These attempts are at best a display of purity culture and at worst naked attempts to silence queer and Black stories. My conflict comes from a series of missed opportunities to educate young people. Johnson does not take the opportunity to explain language and references that may be unfamiliar to young people. They offer absolutists takes on history and learning that are counter to their stated goals. Finally, they engage in transphobia for the sake of storytelling which sends a reckless and dangerous signal to young people. Johnson (who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns) deploys a lot of language and terms without explaining them, like LGBTQIAP+. It would have been helpful to explain the identities that the acronym encompasses (especially because it includes ‘P’ which I had to look up myself to confirm stands for pansexual). A young high schooler may be unfamiliar with this acronym and even if they’ve seen it, there’s a good chance they haven’t had a caring, understanding person explain what it REALLY means. And in that explanation, a young person might have discovered something about themselves. Johnson also uses common phrases in social justice communities like “your identity is valid.” A young person may not know what it REALLY means to have their identity validated (and may not even know what the dictionary definition of “valid” is). For a book addressing young people, there were a number of missed opportunities for this kind of thoughtful, caring education.Next, Johnson explores the whitewashed history of the U.S. In this chapter, Johnson explains that most U.S. history, especially the history of the founders and “great men”, is inaccurate and often excuses or outright ignores harmful deeds. This is absolutely true. However, Johnson picks Lincoln’s position on slavery as their example, which is unfortunate as it is one of the most academically debated aspects of Lincoln’s life. But Johnson doesn’t present it that way. They present Lincoln’s history as something you have been lied to about, and he actually was pro-slavery (or at best was only anti-slavery as an expedient) and anti-Black. Johnson says that schools don’t tell the truth about “Honest Abe”, but that they will. This teaches young people that there is an objective truth about difficult and nuanced history, which won’t serve them well as critical thinkers. It also insists that instead of becoming critical thinkers, that they trade one authority (schools) for another (Johnson). It’s a missed opportunity to show young people how to question and how to learn.Finally, there’s the transphobia (this is about the chapter “Losing Hope”). Johnson dedicates an entire chapter to a deceased, trans relative. They say that they are going to write the chapter in the language they knew at the time, which included deadnaming and misgendering. Why? Johnson proceeds to use the deadname and repeatedly misgender this person in both recounted dialogue and in their authorial voice. They also center themselves in the story of this trans relative, showing how she helped them understand their own queerness better. There is also a lesson about Nanny (Johnson’s grandmother) starting from a place of ignorance and transphobia and growing to accept this trans relative before they died. This is further complicated by the fact that this relative is deceased and couldn’t even consent to their story being used this way. At best this chapter is a lesson about accepting our trans family and friends and perhaps about believing in the possibility for growth (although it’s debatable whether that’s an appropriate lesson for trans kids who may be in dangerous homes). However, the real lesson of this chapter seems to be that it’s acceptable to deadname and misgender someone if you are telling your authentic truth. It’s not. And young people should instead learn that respect and kindness is more important. It would have been just as easy to say “I’m going to write this chapter in the only way I KNOW NOW, which is respecting the name and pronouns of this person, even though I and my family didn’t at the time.”As I said, I’m left conflicted. The world is better with this book in it and available for young people to learn from. But I wish Johnson had taken their responsibility to be a caring teacher more seriously. For older teens and college aged people, I suspect they will have the tools necessary to interpret and use the good lessons in this book on their own. For younger people, I would encourage adding in context to fill in the gaps, especially around the transphobic chapter.Show more"

Was it anger? frustration? sadness? I just knew that it was book that needed to shared, talked about and featured more - in libraries, classrooms and bookstores. Written in the style of a memoir, George M. Johnson candidly and poignantly shares the intersectionality of his Black and queer identities, as he navigates childhood through to adulthood in modern-day America. Never straying from difficult topics such as toxic masculinity, the importance of consent, and notions of brotherhood, Johnson's memoir is one that is easy to physically read but difficult to emotionally process. Delivered through a combination of prose, letters and photographs, ""All Boys Aren't Blue"" is the uncomfortable conversation we all need to with ourselves. This book may make you cry, it may make you smile, but it will definitely make you think - Who are we, really? Are we ourselves, or are we following society's ideals? At what cost can we let our true selves emerge, let alone thrive? Highly recommended. Thank you to Pride Book Tours, George M.

This is different from a lot of memoirs in that the style is clear and matter-of-fact without losing the sense of it being incredibly personal. It avoids the memoir-as-full-immersion-emotional-minefield that is…not uncommon in the genre. Instead, there’s a natural progression from here’s what happened to here was the result to here’s what we can learn from that. The author doesn’t withhold the emotional effects of the events he describes, but at no point did I feel like I was being urged toward a particular emotional extreme. It felt like a considerate, respectful way of presenting a story and letting readers work out the rest for themselves. A couple of ideas stood out to me in particular. The first is that of choosing your own name. It’s an element of identity I wish I saw more discussion around. Another is the author’s willingness and ability to look past an action—even a really shitty one—and into the person beneath without diminishing or justifying the action itself. It shows a level of maturity that is really absent in the world.This has a strong sense of being for something better. It's positive and hopeful without denying that pain exists.

Not sure why that’s so controversial. 🤷🏻‍♀️ That being said, I think a lot of people would benefit from reading this book. What I appreciated most about it was Johnson’s purpose in writing: to give a mirror to Black and / or queer kids growing up who don’t see themselves in media, and to give a window to kids who don’t have those experiences but want to understand them.

I have one complaint.. I wanted more!
On my Pride Month TBR and to amplify Melanated Voices, I dove straight into this memoir for my first June read (2020 really has become the year of the memoirs for me!)

Plot:

In a series of personal essays, prominent journalist and LGBTQIA+ activist George M. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence, and college years in New Jersey and Virginia. From the memories of getting their teeth kicked out by bullies at age five, to flea marketing with his loving grandmother, to his first sexual relationships, this young-adult memoir weaves together the trials and triumphs faced by Black queer boys.This book contains sexual experiences, bullying and trauma. Particularly for those in the LGBTQIA community. 

Review:

I listened to the audiobook version of this Memoir-Manifesto, and I highly recommend you do to, as it is narrated by the author. I LOVE it when authors narrates their memoirs, its the original storytelling method and it feels so personal, like a friend is sharing their story with you directly.many of us connect with each other through trauma and pain: broken people finding other broken people in the hopes of fixing one another.George M. Johnson
This was a raw and heartwarming memoir, Johnson grew up in such an accepting and loving family, and it was still a struggle for them to identify themselves and come out. This gives for heavy reflection on how hard it is, even with a supportive family. It made me look inward and reflect on how I have acted and reacted to friends that have come out and how I could better support them and not put them on the spot with intrusive questions. 

I think a lot of people will find parts of the memoir confronting or triggering based on their own experiences. However I felt that Johnson handled the stories with compassion and empathy. I particularly loved the letters to their family members, celebrating how the people in their life helped shape who they are today. This book is aimed towards a Young Adult/New Adult audience, and while some parts are sexual, it all has its place in helping to open the conversation around sexuality and discovery during those formative years. I truly believe this will be a pivotal book for many youth navigating their identity, understanding consent, Black joy and toxic masculinity.
HIGHLY recommended and will be in my top books for 2020, we are halfway through the year and this is the best memoir I have read so far.

It is the thing that you own. It is attached to every piece of work that you put into the world. Your name holds power when you walk into a room. No two people with the same name are the same person. It’s important that, like everything else you grow to love in life, your name is something you appreciate as well.-Should you not like your name, change it. It is yours, and it will stay with you forever, so do with it what you wish. As we continue to grow through sex and gender, many people will take back their power and change their names—choosing one that fits the person they are, not the one society pushed them to be. Keep your name if you like it. But know that you don’t have to.-Even today, institutions are still having “the first Black person to…” And it means something.-He responded yet again, saying, “There were many things back then that wouldn’t be accepted now. I mean, if I lived during that time, I probably would’ve had slaves, too.” [REALLY?]-I sometimes sit as I’m holding him and think to myself, Who is Baby G gonna end up like? Will he be like his mother’s side of the family? Will he be like you? My greatest worry is that he will be like me. Not because there is anything wrong with that, but because I know how the world can treat boys like me. I also know that it is my duty to protect him regardless of how Baby G turns out to be, because Black babies are born into oppression despite any additional marginalizations.-“I love all of my grandkids, but I love each of you differently. Because you each need different things.”That “different things” part spoke to my soul.-I was becoming isolated around the age of ten, and she saw it. As hard as I tried to suppress my queer identity and fit in, I just didn’t. I had friends, but not how my cousins and brothers had friends. My older cousins had friend circles, and sometimes I could tag along. But I would frequently be too young to hang with them. They would go to parties together, to the local pool, and more often than not, get into fights with other crews together. They were a tight unit, but not my unit.-The hug meant a lot for me because my father wasn’t a PDA type of person, and so I, too, had grown up to be like that. Even now, I’m very on edge with hugs I get from people I may just be getting to know. It’s definitely a barrier, a pathology I learned from him. His ability to change meant that I could do so, too. With that hug, I felt loved.- remember her saying, “Well, if Jermaine wants to go by Hope, then we will call HER Hope.”Nanny scoffed a bit at the idea. “I ain’t calling him no damn Hope. That’s Jermaine.”-Hope replied in jest, “Aunt Louise, I’m a woman, and I wanted a name that fit me. So I chose Hope.”“You need some damn Hope,” Nanny said back. We all laughed hard at that, Hope especially. “Well, I’m a call you Hope then, but I may call you Jermaine still. I been knowing you since you was in diapers as Jermaine, so it’s gonna take me a little time now. I’m old.”-Plus, he was cute. Plus, he is still cute. (And he is going to read this.)-After that foolishness, it was finally time to walk onstage and get my diploma. I remember when they called my name, I got a decent amount of applause to the shock of my family. Everyone always thought I was shy, when in reality I was far from it. The Matthew they had at home was nothing like the shady, gossipy George that many of my classmates came to love.-That summer gave me time to refocus. I had always been smart. I had always gotten good grades, and I honestly had forgotten how happy good grades made me feel. I was so concerned that first year with finding myself while outside the constraints of home that I lost the parts of myself that I liked. I liked being a bit of a bookworm. I liked being considered the smart person in the room. These weren’t things I should’ve been straying away from.[lowkey love how some parts remind me of myself]Show more"

I am a huge proponant of reading banned books, or, even better, not banning books in the first place. This book is George M. Johnson's ""Memoir Manifesto,"" which was written as a way to help young people who may be struggling with issues similar to those the author faced growing up. I thought this was an honest and heartfelt book detailing Johnson's joy, heartbreak and trauma as they grew up in New Jersey, double-marginalized due to being Black and Queer. The story includes letters to family members, along with brief essays retelling different parts of the author's life that served to shape the person they have become.I see a lot of people say don't like to rate memoirs or autobiographies because they feel like they are rating the person's life. I prefer to think of it as rating how the book is written. Even those with the most fascinating lives can write a boring, cliché or disorganized book. Johnson, however, writes informally and from their heart, like the reader is a close friend they are talking to and I love this style! As I was reading this book, I felt like I was part of the family, or at least a close family friend. Johnson drew us in to their childhood filled with cousins, loving parents and their amazing matriarch, Nanny. Johnson also shared stories of trauma, abuse, fear and the sadness of not being able to live freely as their true self. Overall, this book presented a beautiful, powerful and brave perspective much different from my own, that helped deepen my empathy for those dually margjnalized by race and sexual orientation.

Johnson..All Boys Aren't Blue is a brilliant memoir written by George to help black queer boys survive in this harsh world. George's take on how the world sees queer men, especially black ones is written in its crudest form. I finished this in two days and I was left content because it was perfect in every sense. This memoir is warm and offers support to young boys who are looking for validation or just acceptance. Coincidentally, I ended up reading two books revolving around sexuality at the same time, one of it being All Boys Aren't Blue. I loved one and I liked the other. Little did I expect to fall in love with George's writing, unflinchingly honest yet deeply comforting. Just pick this one up if you haven't already and you won't be disappointed..George begins with his childhood, about how he was always considered different. Being an effeminate child, he was often teased at school for preferring to play sports with girls rather than indulging in football. But he quickly clears the notion that queer boys aren't necessarily bad at masculine sports. George himself ran track and later played football just to seek validation from the guys. A particular incident in his childhood leaves him scarred for many years, bringing up his insecurities ever so often. Studying in school with more black students and then swapping to the one with plenty of white faces, he struggles to find a middle ground. As he lists down his experiences in school and college, it's clear that he faced a primal fear of coming out of the closet. While it was evident to his friends that he was queer, he denied it when questioned because he wanted it to happen on his own terms. But the support of his family gave him the freedom to display his sexuality without fear..I particularly loved his grandmother whom he fondly calls Nanny. Her support and acceptance of her grandson's sexuality played an important role in moulding George. His parents and brother too played a pivotal role in encouraging him in their own little ways. There's a lot of intimacy in this memoir, be it about his cousin who was a transgender, the death of his friend and the sexual abuse he faced from someone he trusted. His life has not been easy but he didn't expect it to be that way either. Being black has its own set of limitations and it's abundantly clear in the manner in which his parents taught him from an early age about how to speak politely to the cops in case he ever had to face them. But being black and queer amps up their fear more. Although this memoir states facts and circumstances of pain, it also manages to ooze warmth. George's letters to his mother, grandmother and brother are endearing to read. This memoir is not just for black boys but for everyone to comprehend how sexuality works. At times, we forget the concept of humanity while our judgemental side takes the front seat and this memoir serves as a reminder that everyone is allowed to live freely irrespective of their gender, sexuality and race. This will remain one of my favourites, something blue to think of on a rough day. Now you know which one of the two books I ended up loving..Rating : 5/5This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

I am pleased we did, especially because it coincided with Black History Month. This book is definitely not a happy-go-lucky book (I seem to have a theme recently), so please check the trigger warnings for topics you might not be comfortable with.George M. Johnson's story is not an easy one, but it is one that as many people as possible should read. At least in my opinion. We discussed that this could be an excellent book to introduce people to many queer topics, of course, with the appropriate warnings of the possible triggering content.There were many chapters in this book that especially touched me emotionally and many things that shocked me but sadly, there were also many things that weren't a shock to me. I noticed this especially in the chapter ""Honest Abe"" Lied to Me"" which discusses how twisted American history is often taught in schools. Because I have been in an American history class before, I had a rough knowledge of how different an American history lesson is from a German one (which are my only experiences so far). But that the teacher actually told them  ""I mean, if I lived during that time, I probably would've had slaves, too""  was one of the most shocking parts. Of course, I had to remember that this was in the 80s (I believe), but that doesn't make it any better.Of course, this book isn't written for me as a queer white woman. Still, I believe that many of these stories can touch many, many people, and quite a few have probably lived through similar things.I do have to add that I did not see any reason for the author to deadname his trans cousin. For me, it seemed like that information was really unnecessary to understand the story. So it only made this book uncomfortable for trans readers.I could probably ramble some more, but instead, I will let the book speak for itself and will provide you with some quotes. Spoilers ahead for someone's life story (I guess?):""The spectrum of our traumas can be as broad as our identities.""""I learned that kids who saw me as different didn't have an issue until society taught them to see my difference as a threat.""""Oddly enough, many of us connect with each other through trauma and pain: broken people finding other broken people in the hopes of fixing one another.""""Let yourself unlearn everything you thought you knew about yourself, and listen to what you need to know about those who navigate life outside the margins of a heterosexual box.""""Love who you want to love and do it unapologetically, including the face you see every day in the mirror.""Show more"

Things he learned growing up as a black queer boy and continued to learn as a young adult. This book will shine brightly on every shelf it graces. If you’re looking for a memoir full of lessons, look no further. Small moments, big moments, proud moments, moments of regret. It’s all right here for us to see. Starting from the second George came into this world this story needed to be told.We need more black voices to be heard in literature. Written by BLACK people. There are so many loved books with diverse characters but they need to start being written by black authors. Especially about the black experience. I don’t care what you went to school for. I don’t want to hear the black experience through the lense of someone who is not black. That being said there is so much more to black stories then trauma. And George really showed us so many pieces of his life but also constantly reminded the reader how his family was not perfect but they loved him and some people aren’t so lucky. The thing I appreciated most about this story was it’s honesty. How there were moments he felt like the star of the show and also moments where he felt lost, depressed, confused, and not being true to himself. A lot of those moments he spoke on HE was holding himself back based on the view the world would have of him. But it’s all apart of growing. From the second you start this book you know he’s a star but he also had so many moments where he hid himself and slowly started fading. This book was like starting a puzzle and with each story we got to grab a new piece and see what the picture of George would end up being. His family felt so warm.. they reminded me of my family a lot lol. Set in their ways but nevertheless loving each member within the family. I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which made the experience even better. It really just felt like a long ass conversation with a friend. I laughed. I almost cried, I jotted down quotes and I absolutely need a physical copy of this book ASAP. The cover is absolutely beautiful. He was so careful with the way he spoke. Speaking to the reader with a gentleness at times because he knew someone would pick up this book when they really needed it and he clearly hoped to be a guide to other young black queer boys. All in all everyone should read this book because it was a great memoir. (There are triggers though so look them up please.)And for all the queer boys out there do not let anyone take who you are away from you. ”There was always a something that needs to be erased.. and with that a piece of you” Show more"

I hope a lot of Black queer kids will find this book on their way. “Some of us are pressured into acceptance of an identity before we are fully ready to accept it ourselves.”Also it's the first time someone has ever put into words how I feel about my own queer experience, about hiding and people forcing labels on you when you're not ready yourself.

The focus is on his identities as queer and Black, how he came to embrace those identities and the experiences he had as a Black man around white people, and as a queer man in the Black community. He tells a lot of stories about his loving and supportive Nanny, and her other grandkids-- his cousins-- who were always around. I think this book will be helpful to Black and queer kids finding their identities, Johson's experiences will be relatable to others experiencing the challenges of living their truth. But I have to say as a reader who is considerably older and probably whiter than the target audience, this book is for everyone-- not only just because we all need to read about these experiences but the chapter on caring for his grandmother and mother should be read by everyone, and his matter-of-fact but tender way of saying that yes, we will all have to wipe our elders' asses someday and we need to cope with that is so reassuring. Just being able to discuss caring for parents and grandparents with love and respect is so rare! Why? It's an experience that is probably more universal than having children. I just appreciated hearing him talk about it without judgment or disgust. Which, I suppose, is why it's important that he wrote this memoir-- his ability to discuss sex, identity, sexuality, love, family, gender, and fraternity with that warmth and truth. Also, the fact that the warmth extends to his younger self-- he never judges himself, he really seems to love the kid that he was, which is so good for younger readers.I also recommend We Have Always Been Here: A Queer Muslim Memoir by Samra Habib for older readers (it's not targeted at YA readers).

As always, a copy of this book was provided by the publisher or author in exchange for my honest review. This does not effect my opinion in any way. 
 Filed under: memoirs that are as breathtaking as their covers. Are we sure that my review can't be just me saying 'wow' and seventeen variations of 'read this book immediately'? Because, to put it bluntly, words cannot describe how important George M. Johnson's All Boys Aren't Blue is. Nothing. At. All. The first thing you should know about All Boys Aren't Blue is simple; it needs to be on your 2020 TBR. Capitol letters, all bold, MUST READ. All Boys Aren't Blue is one of the most important memoirs you'll ever experience, no matter your age, and is something that has been desperately needed. Voices like George M. Johnson only come around once in a lifetime. We are fortunate enough to be living in that lifetime. All Boy Aren't Blue is intimate, thought-provoking, and reads like Johnson is right beside you. All Boys Aren't Blue is the type of memoir that will lend hope and friendship to many young readers at such a pivotal time in their lives. Writing a review on memoirs, non-fiction in general, proves to be challenging. Especially when the memoir in question is as good as All Boys Aren't Blue is. All things that 
can
 be said on this stunning memoir are pretty concrete in this magnificent review from Jesse. (Who, if you aren't following, you are missing out.)We're only a few weeks into the new year and I can say confidently that this is amongst the best of 2020.Show more"

Moonlight is one of the few that comes to mind. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), the title is partly a reference to that great film. George M. Johnson writes about everything from loving his grandma, realizing he was different as a young person, his various family members and his positive and negative experiences with them, and college days in an inclusive fraternity. This feels like a field-guide for young queer Black folx on how to navigate coming out, first sexual experiences and discovering sexual preferences, consent, and finding kinship and friendship in the LGBTQ+ community. In terms of the breadth of what he covers, it's very specific to his own life and experiences and doesn't delve into history or larger topics beyond his life. This isn't a ""study of gay Black men in America"" kind of book. It's his life and what he learned from it. A very personal, intimate memoir. A primer for people who don't read a lot of queer books or know much about queer identity. It's accessible and has short chapters and easy to read though serious topics.Trigger warnings for: child molestation, incest, homophobia, violence, descriptions of positive and less than positive sexual experiences, trans death, grandparent death, grief.Show more"

Think that is a true statement. George Mathew Johnson always knows he is different, but it is sad that he had to spend so much time hiding himself and trying to be someone else, yet it is completely understandable. He is a really smart kid, seems funny, nice, and a natural caregiver. When he is only 5 years old, kids beat him up a knock out his baby teeth. How awful. Luckily, he has a family that accepts him. He starts to identify what it means to be a black man and that much of what he learned it school was just making very light of the tragedy of his ancestry. Tells black boys the best the can do is educate themselves. Admitting his sexuality and actually talking about it takes longer. He does finally start discovering who he is in college. He writes candidly to help other young boys feel less alienated. Even when he was young, I guess he seemed feminine, liked jumping rope, but finds he likes football, too. These supposed gender assignments are just that, things we assume at the time that must be that way. That does not make it so. GMJ seems like such an intelligent, out-going, caring friend, and has goals for his life. There was nothing wrong with him. That people get in such a twist that someone seems a bit different is crazy. Good for him for being himself. He graduates from college and now writes and try’s to reach-out to others struggling.

Read by the author, Activist George M Johnson’s part coming of age/part Black Queer manifesto is a beautiful, revealing, and honest memoir that I would press into the hands of any young person coming into their Queer identity, but especially especially Black Queer Teens. Raised by a loving and supportive family, so much of the fruit that borne in his life is in direct correlation to the foundational roots of his home. George, like so many in the LGBTQ community knew from an early age that he was different. But not only was he dealing with his sexuality, he was being exposed to the systemic racism in this country that has been passed on for generations. I love that he doesn’t pander to his reader or censor his memories, trusting that young adults can not only handle what he has to say, but might be dealing with the same issues he faced. And at the end what I was left with was a reflection about the uniqueness of all our lives, and the gift in sharing our stories. Johnson’s book covers so many subjects from sexuality to grief, from race and the importance of family, and that in sharing, it can lead to greater acceptance and understanding.Show more"

Johnson has written the memoir/manifest that they would've needed as a child.One for all the queer black kids, to see that they are not alone.And to learn that even if you have a supportive family, coming out and especially coming into your own identity is still incredibly hard and especially so for people with more than one marginalisation like queer black people.I was moved by how raw and open they wrote about their childhood, traumas and sexual experiences. It also showed me that you don't have to share the same background or identity to have similar experiences and feelings. I could relate to a lot of what George M. Johnson talked about especially in relation to the exploration of their identity and sexuality.So books like these are incredibly important both for the specific target audience but also for everyone else to learn that after all we are all not that different!At somes points I felt a little disconnected to the story because I had the feeling that some of their writing style alternated between telling and showing and I definitely prefer the showing part.But despite that personal preference I would absolutely recommend everyone and especially marginalised teens to read this book!Show more"

All boys aren't blue ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Memorable Quote: We all deserve more than the ability just to exist!Hey, y'all! I'm coming to you with a sure-fire review of the beautiful work that is All Boys Aren't Blue. First, I will start by saying that this book is an amazing debut and coming of age story that I feel is needed in society today that deals with finding an identity and reclaiming self-worth in a society that often disregards and does not respect differences in others. This book gave me insight and made me reflect on my own truth when teaching students who often do not see or value themselves until they are adults. Although it is labeled YA I definitely think it is suitable for adults as well who are interested in understanding and help breakdown barriers that often hinder others' understanding of the LGBTQ community. I loved how the author broke down different terminology that will help students who do and don't identify better understand themselves and others... My favorite part had to be the conversation about his brother and nana. Please run out and pick this up... Put self aside and learn to empathize with people who are different from you. Show more"

THIS BOOK. My heart, this book touched my heart and made me feel so many emotions, from crying my eyes out on some chapters, to feeling a keen sense of Deja Vu on others, to learning about Black Queer Experiences and feeling a mixture of sympathy, empathy, love and pride! This book is exactly what it is described as, a Manifest, a Queer Manifesto, a Black Queer Manifesto and it was Beautiful! It was a candid and raw exploration of identity in terms gender, sexuality, family and blackness. It serves as a guideline for young queer people navigating identity, sex, and relationships, especially Young Black Queer People! I listened to the Audiobook and it was narrated by the author, and that made for an even greater reading experience! And not only is this manifesto of a memoir poignant, evocative and powerful, but it is also written in beautiful prose that captures you inside the beautiful mind of the author!I cannot reccomend this book enough, and I can't stress enough the undeniable importance of the existence of this book, especially in our current social climate!!Show more"

He really explores the intersection of going through life both queer and Black in a way that’s so honest and accessible.I particularly enjoyed reading about his time at an HBCU and joining a fraternity. Greek life isn’t known for being inclusive, so reading about all the amazing relationships he made from the experience was really surprising.The chapter “‘Honest Abe’ Lied to me” was excellent and really demonstrated how whitewashed our history is in the US. I bookmarked nearly every page.

This is a moving, beautifully-narrated YA memoir about George M Johnson's childhood, adolescence, and college years. He describes the trauma of having his teeth being kicked out as a child, which changed him as a person (and changed the way he smiled for many years). He talks about the racism he's experienced, the complex, close relationships he has with different family members, and his experiences as a Black gay man growing up in the 1980s and 90s.I listened to this on audio and the audiobook is brilliantly narrated by the author. He describes the key moments in his life with raw feeling and power. I always enjoy it when authors narrate their own work, but this is perhaps the best instance of this I've ever listened to. George M. Johnson's words hold potency and impact that few other narrators do, as he urges readers to fight for equality.

I highly recommend it and it should be read by everyone: queer, straight, Black, or White. Johnson takes his life story and puts it out there in order to help queer youth. His overwhelming message is that this society is so forcibly heteronormative that queer youth can often feel like out or ""othered"", espeically queer youth of color. The only thing that kind of rubbed me wrong was his chapter about virginity. There was this overarching theme that sexual attraction is the norm, and I'd like to point out that asexual people do exist. For sexual people, I'd agree that practice can make perfect, but there are people who don't need, want or care for sexual attraction or intimacy at all. Besides that, George breaks down racism, toxic masculinity and gender norms throughout this book in the best way possible. I loved his narrative and his voice permeated every story.

Johnson lets himself be extremely vulnerable, talking about growing up gay in a community where he did not feel he could be open about it. Although his family was accepting of him, he hid his truth at the HBCU he attended in the early 2000s. Perhaps most striking to me was a chapter about his first sexual encounters, which Johnson shares to make the point that since queer sexuality is not covered in school sex ed, many queer people engage in risky behavior because they don't have the knowledge to protect themselves. Johnson is up front about the content of the book in his introduction, so it shouldn't take anyone by surprise.

They either faced discrimination because of their race when amongst white people or had to suppress their sexuality amongst other Black people.

I couldn't relate to any of Johnson's experiences and the writing was very basic and made me cringe (I hate when authors explain their metaphors, analyzing the deeper meaning of events and images instead of letting the reader figure it out). However, it's certainly an important work, and I'm glad it exists. The author reminds you of its importance throughout in case you forget or miss it. To me, it reads like a college application essay; I read it because it's in our library and people are protesting its inclusion in a school library in a neighboring district, so I figured it'd be a good idea to read it all the way through.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64614050-emily,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 2 out of 5,"April 13, 2022",3 likes,0,"I want to say first of all that this book's very existence is vital. Johnson has an important voice to add to YA nonfiction and I hope this book finds the readers who need it. Intersectionality is an especially crucial topic that has been missing from this realm, so the author's experiences as a Black queer person are welcome representation. (A note: following publication of this book, Johnson came out as nonbinary, and uses they/them pronouns) I'm so glad this book has received the attention and accolades it has.That said: I didn't really like All Boys Aren't Blue. Part of it might be that, based on the many, many, five-star reviews, I was expecting some truly exceptional writing. However, the writing itself is mediocre at best, and the simplicity cannot be written off as a style choice for the target demographic. Books can be written for young readers while still maintaining a strong literary voice, and the best memoirs ought to have good prose style rather than just recounting events. I personally find writing that directly addresses the reader (""Didn't I tell you there'd be a lot of stories in this book?"", etc.) kind of awkward, but that's down to personal taste. Johnson's writing in All Boys Aren't Blue is serviceable and not clunky, but that's the best I can say for it. It didn't enthrall me or leave me wanting more, but it alone isn't responsible for my low rating.While there are shining moments in Johnson's narrative, the majority of the memories are frankly... a bit boring. It doesn't help that the author's insights are fairly shallow, and mostly rest on societal trends and statistics rather than any deep personal introspection. There were moments where Johnson seemed to realize that the way they felt about an event didn't actually line up with the point they wanted to make, or what they thought the acceptable moral lesson should be. For example, in the chapter recounting their cousin sexually assaulting them, Johnson speaks with a lot of empathy about their and their cousin's shared shame about their sexualities and Johnson's own suspicion that their cousin may have also been a victim of abuse. They speak with deep love and understanding towards their cousin, who has since died, and expresses forgiveness towards him. Then, Johnson hastily ends the chapter with a couple sentences about how no one should feel obligated to forgive their abuser. While this is an important statement, the way it was tacked on to the very end of the chapter made it seem like Johnson was saying what they know they should, rather than having a nuanced discussion about what forgiveness as a survivor looks like or whether it's a necessary part of healing.Another example: in a later chapter, there was some unexplored dissonance between Johnson's pride at joining a fraternity and shame at continuing to hide their sexuality. They describe their pledge as a moment of triumph and brotherhood and ~claiming their masculinity~ while completely brushing off homophobic remarks from the brothers which pushed Johnson to deny being gay literally the night before. Johnson is very careful to cite statistics on hazing deaths associated with fraternities, but still clearly presents their own fraternity experience as wholly positive and beneficial. I'm not trying to tell the author how to feel, but I wish there'd been deeper engagement with these contradictions in the narrative, and a more honest conversation about organizational homophobia in the Greek system.The book as a whole seemed to lack nuance or consideration of factors beyond the author's personal scope. For example, while Johnson focuses heavily on their intersecting identity as a queer Black person, they do nothing to address their class privilege which is evident throughout the memoir. While clearly expressing love and appreciation for Black culture, queer culture is largely and conspicuously absent. Since Johnson states their purpose for writing this memoir is for the young readers who need to see themselves in it, I wonder why there wasn't any name-dropping of queer Black historical figures or icons like Bayard Rustin, Queen Latifah, Marsha P. Johnson, Laverne Cox, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, or so many others (compared to the multiple mentions of Beyoncé and Anita Baker and civil rights leaders like MLK and Rosa Parks, not to mention a whole chapter dedicated to Abe Lincoln). There is also a very uncomfortable chapter about Johnson's late transgender cousin, who is repeatedly and unneccessarily deadnamed and misgendered by the author. I tried to find an interview or post with Johnson addressing this terrible lapse (especially considering the author themself is not cisgender) but all I found was this tweet (TW: murder, transmisogynoir) from 2018 critiquing misgendering in a news article about a trans woman's murder. Johnson wrote: ""Trans women are women and should be referred to as women in death and in life."" Well said. Perhaps take your own advice?I was also extremely off-put by the chapter in which Johnson recounts having sex for the first time. Not because of the detailed descriptions, but because of the total lack of interrogation of the experience. Johnson describes their first encounter receiving anal penetration as being very painful, with the pain lasting three weeks afterward. The amount of detail given about the encounter makes it pretty clear to me that this was due to a complete lack of prep-- the guy put on a condom and shoved it in. (Johnson's first time topping was similar; no prep at all. Though they describe their more experienced receiving partner as enjoying the encounter.) This would have been a good opportunity for Johnson to talk about the importance of prep and foreplay, paying attention to your partner's comfort level, and that sex shouldn't be painful (unless all parties are into that and consent to it). Instead, there's a few sentences about how since that first time Johnson has learned more about their body and how to communicate their pleasure during sex, how they wish queer sex education had been part of their upbringing, and how they hope their experiences will help readers be more prepared than they were. But... how can Johnson's experiences help prepare young readers when the reason for their bad experience (lack of prep) isn't even mentioned? How does Johnson simply writing about the dearth of queer sex education actively help teens learn about queer sex? Johnson says they now know more about their body and how to communicate during sex... but doesn't include any examples about what that means or how they communicate. The explicit detail in this chapter wasn't concentrated in the right places, in my opinion.My review is definitely weighed more towards the negatives, but mostly All Boys Aren't Blue isn't terrible. There are some decent observations about toxic masculinity and whitewashing of history, and some of the stories about Johnson's close-knit family were very touching. I really appreciate Johnson's commitment to telling their story, and bravery in baring private, personal, painful moments. But ""not terrible"" isn't enough to recommend a book, especially when there were a few very bothersome parts and the rest didn't do much groundbreaking. Like I said at the beginning, the existence of this story-- the fact that it was published and is available for teen readers-- is fantastic and necessary. But I hope this is just the beginning, and that more (better written) YA memoirs follow in its wake.TW: racism, homophobia, transphobia, misgendering, deadnaming, gender expression policing, coming out themes, child sexual assault, incest, physical assault, mention of drug abuse, cancer, hospitalization, mention of surgery, death of a loved one, grief, mention of hazing death, mention of AIDS death, N slur, F slur✨I read this title for the Magical Readathon: Orilium!✨Spring Equinox: ArtificeryShow more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 4 out of 5,"August 5, 2021",6 likes,0,"(3.5) Growing up in New Jersey in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Johnson knew he was different. He preferred Double-Dutch to football, called his classmates “Honeychild,” and begged for a pair of cowboy boots instead of the sneakers everyone else coveted. His effeminate ways earned the expected epithets. Even though he had plenty of LGBT precedents in his own family – a gay older half-brother, a lesbian aunt, a trans cousin – and his beloved Nanny assured him he was loved for who he was, he didn’t publicly confess his identity until he got to college and felt accepted as part of a fraternity. In fact, there are three instances in the book when, as a teenager, he’s asked directly if he’s gay and he denies it. (Do you hear a rooster?)Johnson is a warm, earnest storyteller and deftly chooses moments when he became aware of the social disadvantages inherent to his race and sexuality. His memoir is marketed to teens, who should find a lot to relate to here, such as dealing with bullies and realizing that what you’ve been taught is comforting myth. In the “‘Honest Abe’ Lied to Me” chapter, he discovers in middle school that Lincoln didn’t actually support racial equality and questions whether landmark achievements by Black people are just conciliatory tokens – “symbolism is a threat to actual change—it’s a chance for those in power to say, ‘Look how far you have come’ rather than admitting, ‘Look how long we’ve stopped you from getting here.’”The manifesto element of the book lies in its investigation of the intersection of Blackness and queerness. Johnson is an activist and wants queer Black kids to have positive role models. He knows he was lucky to have family support and middle-class status; many have it harder, getting thrown out and ending up homeless. Multiple chapters are devoted to his family members, some in the form of letters. The structure didn’t always feel intuitive to me, with direct address to his cousin or grandmother coming seemingly out of nowhere. The language is informal, but that doesn’t excuse “me and so-and-so” constructions or referring to “people that” instead of “who”; young adult readers need to have good grammar reinforced.I also questioned whether the author needed to be so sexually explicit in describing his molestation at the hands of an older male cousin (he has about a zillion cousins) and losing his virginity at age 20. Then again, today’s teens are probably a lot more sexually knowledgeable than I was 20+ years ago. All in all, I wondered if Johnson is more successful as a motivational speaker than a writer. I think his occasional bravado (he closes his introduction with “This is the story of George Matthew Johnson. This is a story for us all.”) would come across better in person than in print. Still, considering I couldn’t be much further from the target audience, I found this a sweet and engaging read.Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck.Show more"

This was perhaps the most profound line of the book - Johnson's point being that marginalized people often have to choose staying physically safe versus seeking satisfaction. A stark reality that as a woman I've had to take into consideriation a few times, but definitely haven't had to make it my primary operating mode.My favorite line of the entire book was ""I am putting energy into the things I can change, and praying about the rest."" Johnson and I woud potentially disagree about a lot, but on that view we could find common ground, about how powerful we would all be if we followed a similar mantra.I didn't enjoy this book. It was raw, authentic, and full of advocacy that challenged some of my world views. It made me uncomfortable, which is why I suspect it lands itself on banned books lists of late. People generally don't like to have their world views challenged or be uncomfortable. It also is too much shouting and not enough showing, but that is likely because Johnson has had to shout to be heard his entire life.But change doesn't happen without challenge, and the greatest thing about books is the ability to sit with information, stories, narratives, and insights that are difficult and process them at one's own speed. In this case, a long day of housework and a rather short audio telling, had me wrestling with all of these things in one sitting.Johnson's memoir is a collection of stories about growing up black and queer. He purposefully makes his readers uncomfortable. Johnson requires his readers to sit alongside him and understand, just a bit, what it was like to be him - surrounded by the familiar and yet wildly out of place and uncomfortable. He is a decent writer and a skilled narrator, and having a voice is important, even if it isn't easy to digest.So it gets 3 stars because it is an important voice and decently written, even if I didn't really enjoy reading it and the frankness made me quite uncomfortable. In the end, that is really the point of learning new things - moving out of one's comfort zone.Show more"

Dealing with being black and being queer of a double bonanza doesn't stop you from being happy is so beautifully underlined here..The upbringing of children be it via the role of George s Nanny, parents and extended family or the bias of white parents in passing it onto their children and in schools as well is one aspect that touched my core here. It says 'It wasnot them shaming me as much as it was those raising them who taught them to shame others with those qualities'.The brotherhood he finds later, sinking in and then coming back all the while coming out to be what he is with his family having his back always also kept me speechless.

It’s existing. We all deserve more than just the ability to exist.”5 🌠Beauty. A young adult memoir manifesto of George M. Johnson - black, queer, beautiful. This book is one currently attempting to be banned in multiple states, but more than that, this book, these stories, that of queer, black, and all marginalized groups have been silenced for much longer. Johnson shares just one story - their story, raw and unfiltered as a reminder and a lesson that each day is a gift. Family and friendship is love, identity is truth, and we never know if the people who were here with us yesterday will be here with us tomorrow. Life is short, trauma is real, but there's so much life to live. Education, activism, love - the solutions to setting up our future generations with the knowledge and confidence to know that they are enough and that their existence is not based on the dictations of society. Queer, black and unapologetic. A book that is not only a good read but important and crucial. For me a lot of points hit home, from balancing masculinity and femininity to questioning myself among family, the fears of coming out and hate slurs, to the fears and experiences I have yet to face as a gay man. However, I think what was most important is not what I related to, but what I learned. I found myself with tears in my eyes, I found myself angry, I found myself embarrassed, and uncomfortable. Everyone has a story to be told and this story is one that will continue to change the world. What we remember is that family, friends, and ourselves is what we carry with us every day in our battle of life. “Love who you want to love, and do it unapologetically, including that face you see every day in the mirror.”Show more"

It removes the fact that hate doesn’t just stop because a law or the time changed”Where do I start? The writing in this memoir feels so personal, to the point where you can imagine George is right in front of you, telling you these stories. The awareness he has as a person is incredible, the pacing of this book was perfect, and each of the stories that were told not only had purpose, but had life to them, and they were MEANT to be told the way they were. Not only are the stories themselves so beautifully written, but every character in this book (or family member should I say) got me attached within seconds of them appearing. Every name had different memories and feelings attached to them that I haven’t even lived. You can genuinely feel the love Johnson’s family gave to him through the pages of his story. You feel nostalgia for his experiences even if you can’t necessarily relate to what he’s going through.Every queer person should read this story. It brings a sense of comfort and joy in one’s identity, because you are reminded again and again how important it is to share your identity (WHEN YOU ARE READY) and be proud of who you are.

But this one does cover some important ground and is an important voice for young people to have access to. Many students will see themselves in this story and Johnson doesn’t sugar coat his lived experiences. Johnson has lived a life that can be cited as a success story, considering his loving family, education, and successful career. But some people can’t see the value in success stories that candidly share the the very real challenges faced along the way — in Johnson’s story, this would be his experiences with figuring out his identity, racism, homophobia, and assault.People who want to ban books like this need to spend time with black and queer youth, as well as young people who have gone through traumatic experiences. They feel alone. Kids don’t always talk about those feelings with each other. Books like this can remind them that they aren’t alone. For kids who haven’t experienced these things, books like this can be a critical source of empathy.

Plus, it is very personal so it feels wrong to rate someone's life (that's not exactly what rating books is but still). So it was great to see someone grow up different in a family that accepted and supported that and let the author grow at their pace. They had difficult moments in their life but it didn't come from clichés situations. The family dynamic was very interesting but told in a somewhat confusing way. Their family is big, a lot of members, so much so that it got a bit confusing to me at times. The exploration of the author slowly discovering and accepting their own queerness was interesting. But it was more tell than show. Not many scenes proper in this memoir, there were a few but I wanted a more immersive experience, if that makes sense. And that's my main criticism. Everything included was interesting but not everything was proven/shown. The message of acceptance of differences is important and very clear though so I would recommend it and I really don't get why the book is banned so much (I mean I get it and I don't) because it is mainly a book about love, support and self acceptance so it feels very strange to be against that...Show more"

I wanted to read for myself the book in its entirety and not the cherry picked ‘pornographic’ parts cited by challengers. This is the librarian talking - Truthfully non fiction books and autobiographies were a tough sell to my teen patrons so it may be adults that mainly read this. I’m betting the controversy over it will make it appealing to teens, and labeling a book pornographic will certainly get the teen attention, so well done book challengers. As a librarian I’m glad there are books for all types of teen readers out there. This is the mother talking- though I’m not the intended audience I connected with George’s voice. He wrote about a family that loved him and supported him, no matter what. But even with his family’s love there were still many things they couldn’t protect him from. It filled my heart to hear how much he loved his mama and Nanny, it broke my heart to hear how he still felt alone many times. Representation matters. And stories like this deserve to be told. I’m betting along with being challenged and banned, it will win awards, be put on book lists, and probably adapted to a movie. So no matter who tries to silence this story, it will find an audience.

I’m not sure if it’s a memoir or a series of short stories, or even what the difference between those are, but the story line is very relatable. This is coming from a white middle-aged suburban mom reading about a black boy growing up queer.This book was definitely a window into a life very different from mine, yet I felt so many parts of George’s story would resonate with people of all ages, but especially teens and young adults. Life events, such as the challenges of not fitting in and being different, getting bullied, the love and support, of family, the ups and downs of being a student, all play out in the stories and are sometimes funny, sometimes hard and often thought-provoking. It’s the kind of book that would make for a good book club discussion.That being said, I can identify the parts, two or three, that people are struggling with.- having to do with sexuality, experimentation and a non-consensual encounter with a relative when George was underage. These are definitely heavy topics for a mature audience. That being said, though, I feel that books often find their ways into the hands of those that need them. And one of the main premises of the book is trying to get these tales into those hands.As I’ve shared my impressions about this book with a few people, a question that has emerged is whether or not books dealing with coming of age sexuality for straight people are found in school libraries. While that is something to consider, I still feel that having access to books that can be mirrors, reflecting back someone’s life to help them feel that they’re not alone, is a powerful thing. My hope is that teens and young adult readers in need of seeing themselves reflected in texts or are an ally of someone with questions around their sexuality, will find this book.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

Johnson for youth, and LGBTQIA+ youth in particular. In it, he describes his experiences in childhood and adolescence at the intersection of being Black and discovering his gender identity and physical attraction. The directness in the writing and in the purpose make this memoir POWERFUL. Each chapter is an entity that can stand alone. In fact, as I listened to the introduction, I made mental notes about how I would teach this to my students. The same thing happened in several other chapters. I, genuinely, cannot wait to teach excerpts of this book in my classroom, both because of the powerful content and because of its beautiful, direct language. I especially loved the chapters that were addressed directly to family members. The chapter for his brother and for his grandma, Nanny, had me in nonstop tears. THEY WERE SO BEAUTIFUL!!! Johnson has such a loving multigenerational family network that created space for him to be his whole self. He also acknowledges that this is a privilege that not many LGBTQIA+ youth have. I have so much gratitude toward Johnson for being willing to share his story. He wants his readers to learn and understand what he has learned. More importantly, he wants to make his story visible because he knows that a story like this would have really helped him in his youth. This is a must-read. I learned so much.Show more"

I keep thinking about how I would have benefitted from books like this as a queer teenager - it’s very real and honest about growing up queer, but also hopeful and encouraging and resilient. Johnson’s only a few years younger than me, so a lot of his cultural touchstones were familiar to me, and it made me think about how much has changed in the last twenty years in terms of general awareness of queer people and queer culture. Like, obviously, things are not perfect, and there are a number of places trying to ban this book right now, so much of that same prejudice still exists. But just the fact that a book like this could be published and marketed as YA is an indication of the shift that’s happened, and I am glad to see it.Show more"

Elbette yaşadığımız her şey bir deneyim ve yolumuzu belirliyor ama bu kadar pozitif bir yaklaşımı sevemiyorum. Kitabı genel olarak beğendim. Yer yer ‘Her tünelin ucu aydınlıktır.’ sonucuna çıksın diye bazı hikayelerin değiştiğini ya da yumuşatıldığını hissettim. Her hayat anlatılmaya değer bir hikayedir bence fakat düzgün anlatalım mı, ne olur. Öte taraftan genç Lgbti+ edebiyatı için ( özellikle afro-amerikan lgbti+ bireyler için.) önemli bir kitap olduğunu düşünüyorum. I don't like stories where everything is connected to happiness. Of course, everything we live through is an experience and determines our path, but I cannot like such a positive approach. I liked the book in general. From time to time I felt that some stories were changed or softened in order to reach the conclusion that ""There is a light at the end of every tunnel.""

I didn't feel directed towards any specific action even though I liked their story well enough. There were many times that the memoir could have expanded into a huge topic but it never did before the chapter ended. There were definitely unanswered questions. This book brings into question the value of literary representation on its own without having to judge quality of writing or striving for a bigger picture. It had cathartic vibes and maybe it was therapeutic to process these stories again and then put them in the context of the world.That being said, the book did have some good quotes and moments:- pg33 ""Our community struggles to connect with joy in the way that we have with pain""- pg 118 ""Are you teaching people how to swim or are you letting them drown""- pg 227 - the idea that reinventing your expressed identity would be easier in a new place - this was highly relatable to me. I remember wanting to get away from my home town in order to be known as more than an academic perfectionist. I felt like the people around me had a static view of who I was and that I couldn't break out of it to show them there was a lot more to me than being intense about school. This ultimately led me to bide my time until I could move away before even trying to express myself differently. The stakes were much lower than for someone trying to express a particular gender or sexual identity more openly, but the concept resonated strongly with me. I'm having trouble identifying the niche this book would most speak to, but if you're looking for a black non binary voice this fits the bill.Show more"

This book was so powerful. I love reading about other peoples experiences, especially ones that are so unlike my own. George M. Johnson tells us about his life from when he knew he was different as a child all the way through college. He grew up in a comfortable middle class family in New Jersey, surrounded by the love of parents, siblings, cousins and extended family. This isn’t a sad tragic story. This is someones life – “the good, the bad, and the things he was too afraid to talk about publicly.”George (Matthew, as he went by his middle name early in life) starts off by telling us why his story is important and while it is a “young adult” book, its often young adults who need to hear the words he wrote. The topics he speaks about aren’t too much for young people, because they are often living through the same things he did.This book was eye opening to me – it made me happy at times, seeing the unyielding love and support he always received from his family, most of all his Nanny, grandmother to so many in his family; and sad at times – seeing the abuse he endured for being a feminine presenting Black boy to being sexually assaulted by an older family member.There is no right way to grow up Black and queer, but as George states throughout this book, he didn’t have anyone to look up to or know what to do growing up. This book is important for those today who don’t see themselves in literature, who don’t know what to do with how they are feeling. I hope this books reaches those who need it most, and I hope they can learn they aren’t alone in the world.
Audiobook Thoughts
This audiobook is narrated by George M. Johnson himself and I love when authors narrator their own works, especially for a memoir, I think the author narrating it makes it so much more powerful. I would highly recommend this one as an audiobook - its not too long either - some audiobooks are intimidating but this felt like listening to a friend tell a story.
Recommend?
I would recommend this to everyone. If you’re looking to diversify your reading, this is an excellent place to start. If you’re looking to read more non-fiction, this is also an excellent place to start. This is a powerful read, just be aware going into this it is real and real life isn’t always pretty.Frayed Books - blog | twitter | bookstagram | fbShow more"

In equal parts charming, brave and pensive, this book offers a keen insight into our society's deep-rooted racism, queer phobia and most importantly one's struggle with their sexuality and gender identity. 'All Boys Aren't Blue' in its distinctively frank narrative traces the major historical and impactful events of Black history, like slavery, Emancipation Proclamation and AIDS epidemic, effectively shattering some of my pre-conceived notions about these events. Johnson has unflinchingly documented their struggles with gender identity and sexuality, making this book a perfect written down replica of an understanding adult for anybody grappling with the same. While dealing with the issues in this book, the author never fails to mention their familial and financial privileges. In fact, family relationships play a big part in Johnson's life and consequently in this memoir. Their anecdotes, both entertaining and sombre on occasions, and their support and love for each other give this book a softer ambience amidst the hard truths of rampant racism, discrimination, toxic masculinity, marginalization and queer phobia.❝Love who you want to love, and do it unapologetically, including that face you see every day in the mirror.❞ This book is not only a memoir, it's a love letter to one's own self. I'd recommend it to everyone in teen and adult age range. Do read it, this one of a kind book is absolutely unputdownable.Show more"

All opinions remain my own.(Link to the reading vlog https://youtu.be/3soTAU5_FHo)I've heard so much love for this book from early reviewers and people from places it was published first, so I knew I had to read it when I could, hence my excitement when I saw it on Netgalley and got approved. This is a fantastic memoir about a black, queer persons life, starting from their first traumatic experience as a child, travelling through their youth and realising they had to wear a mask to fit in and be liked, up until adult years. I'm really not sure why I first thought it was going to be in the form of verse, though.Although heartbreaking that a child at an early age felt they weren't normal because of who they were, ultimately it's also got a lot of hope embedded within each telling of tales around growing up and finding who you are, and that who you are is important.I absolutely loved this memoir, especially because it's funny as well as truthful, so has a nice balance, which I think gives the desired effect as it's aimed at YA. You want the truth, but you don't want to be put off of... well.. life, and living your truth. The family pictures featured inside were so lovely too.The chapter that was a letter to George's little brother was such a beautiful thing to read. It brought tears to my eyes and was such an uplifting, kind letter. This was followed by a beautiful chapter on George's nanny, which made me feel even more emotion because she shares the same first name as my nanny! The beautiful messages just kept coming with the chapter on George's cousin, Hope, and the letter to their mum.I also loved that George still found comfort in prayer despite feeling so isolated for much of their life and that they still felt that faith was for anyone. So often, religion and sexuality butt heads, but it was just so nice to see it harmonious.This memoir covered so much: sexuality, black identity, growing up, death, assault, oppression, brotherhood, family, acceptance (in many forms) and much more. It was more than I expected and so much really spoke to me on a personal level. This was phenomenal and everyone should read it, even if you don't fall under the lgbtqia+ umbrella, it's worth a read for sure.Pick it up, give it a go and enjoy! >(^_^)<GénShow more"

Being queer is a journey. One that is ever changing as identities that were once in the dark come to light. As relationships that once needed to be hidden come to a place of greater visibility.
I'm always conflicted with rating and reviewing memoirs because, as I have said before, how can I just judge someone's life. These are real events that the author has lived through. So I usually rate it 5 stars. But this memoir isn't an uncertain ""oh I guess I'll give it five stars because I should."" It is 1000% worthy of 5 stars. It made me laugh, it made me shed a tear or two, and most importantly it has a purpose.All Boys Aren't Blue is a young adult memoir spanning from the beginning of Johnson's life to their college graduation. As we read, we see how Johnson has struggled with their identity in several ways, even as a child, both internally and externally. From being bullied at a young age for being ""different"", to having a grandmother that doubles as a best friend, to having a somewhat queer family but yet still closeted. Simply put, all boys aren't blue, and Johnson has been proving that their whole life. This is quite possibly the best memoir I've read. It's different because it's not just labeled as a memoir, it's a memoir-manifesto. Johnson writes their memoir in a way that I aspire to write. Pieces of their life story mixed with informational, educational tidbits filled with love and nurture. You can see how much they care for future generations of queer kids, especially black queer kids with the lessons they include along the way. As proven in the very final sentence of the Afterword, ""Whether this book is a bestseller or a flop, if one person is helped by my story, then it was all worth it."" I have never read anything that has had so much heart and soul poured out into these pages, desperate to help their audience, desperate to make queer kids feel safe.If you are ever feeling alone as you navigate the world as a black queer person (or even just as a queer person), go read this book. You are not as alone as you think you are. They are here for you. Stay safe my queer babes <3.Show more"

I esp want queer black boys to read this book, this book made me cry a little and smile a little with each section that became even more powerful and insightful to hear him discuss such well-known topics in the black community only it's hardly spoken of i.e. therapy in the black community, masculinity, queerness obviously in the black community, and sexual assault from a family member. I related to a lot of things listed there, and as the years go by I've become more outspoken about these and I am proud of every black person who uses their voice to teach this community vulnerability is ok.There is a specific chapter where George spoke about a cousin who passed away, who was his abuser one night, and I found it very bittersweet how George didn't loathe him but rather empathized with him because of his sexuality in an earlier and more ""outwardly homophobic"" time and the abuse he must've been through which led up to him doing that to George, and George thought it was not acceptable but he believes it has more to it and he has forgiven him in a sense. I thought it was also needed and well put how George states you don't have to empathize with your abuser, that is just his personal thought. This section made my heart especially heavy!I haven't experienced the death of a close one, only of family members I've never met or been esp close to, and that chapter with George's friend made me cry because I could just feel the sadness and the realisation. All boys aren't blue is such a needed book for the queer black community and the queer community overall! It shows you queer people don't experience the same things base on their communities, and I think a lot of people don't like to accept that. Although, I'm not of George's identity I could fully understand and hope many others enjoy and feel empowered by this book as well.Show more"

“Knowledge is truly your sharpest weapon in a world hell-bent on telling you stories that are simply not true.”
I confess that I have been really bad at reading non fiction this year... Probably partly because I preferred escaping the real world with fiction reads instead. I couldn't resist picking up All Boys Aren't Blue though when I saw it was a Goodreads Choice Awards finalist, as I have been wanting to read it for a while in the first place. It most definitely turned out to be such an important and powerful memoir! George M. Johnson not only tells us his own story and struggles relating to his black and queer identity, but tries to speak to the YA black/queer community to show them they are not alone. For this alone I consider this a must-read for any reader young and old, as it helps giving insight in both the black and queer community and the discrimination and struggles they have to face to this date. This memoir is presented as a series of essays, and mixes lighter moments with heavy topics while also trying to open our eyes as a reader. It is a story about family as well as the author's journey finding himself and his real identity... It's a memoir that is both informative and moving and I can highly recommend it.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2058014-jk,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 3 out of 5,"February 26, 2021",3 likes,0,"Johnson has written this YA memoir solely to help others just like him. Drawing on his experiences growing up as a gay Black boy, he recounts his worries and hopes, and recalls how he didn’t have any books or media to guide him as he grew up. This is something I truly believe is important - everyone should be able to find someone to relate to in life - and I commend him for sharing his obstacles, some of which I imagine would have been very painful to remember, never mind committing to paper.There was a lot to learn here as a white woman, so reading this isn’t only beneficial for those either Black or queer. I found some deeper insight into how society is so ingrained in unconscious (or indeed conscious) racism and homophobia, some of the origins of this, and how I can continue to learn and make efforts to improve myself and the language I use.In addition, Johnson ensures he reinforces just how accepting and affirming his family were of his ‘differences’, and how this impacted his life. He does this so forcefully as he’s aware of the general misconception that the Black community wouldn’t be as accepting as others, and he entirely quashes this myth with his heartwarming stories of family life.I would have loved for this to have felt a bit deeper. Johnson tells us stories as though we were old friends, and this feels cosy for a little while, until I started to feel I’d prefer to be shown these things happening, rather than being told. Sometimes I felt he was only touching the surface of the story, and I would’ve liked some more depth to what I was hearing. I also felt some more editing could have helped - the chapters aren’t chronological, so I felt confused at times on where I was with Johnson in his life. It felt jarring and dizzying; a bit more of a focus on the structure could have helped this massively.An important and powerful book, and although it’s intended to help those who are young, queer, Black, or a combination of those, it’s also helpful for those outside of those communities to learn more about the types of experiences these people have, and how we can help, even if it’s in the smallest of ways.Show more"

I hope parents of femme boys and tomboys find this book as well and it helps them help their children have confidence in being themselves. George M. Johnson writes honestly about his life growing up as a queer black boy who’s effeminate ways were obvious even from a young age. The tension between the desire to express his true love (like double-dutch jump-roping) with the society’s expectations of boys, especially black boys (get on the football field) is eloquently expressed by the adult Johnson. Every chapter, every episode related by Johnson is told with love and compassion for the boy he was and the man he grew into. That compassion extends to those he encountered throughout his life, even those who did not understand him and who objectively caused him harm. Like Johnson, I grew up in a close-knit, loving family and like Johnson, that protected me from much as a child, even when my family did not understand or agree with my self-expression. But that love couldn’t protect me from everything. Many children experience events uncomfortable to them but they don’t have the language to talk about what made them uncomfortable and why. Instead they carry those memories and feelings with them, sometimes getting sorted out in the future, sometimes not. The events don’t even have to be as serious as sexual assault. In writing this, Johnson writes directly to those children and their inner world of questions, feelings, confusion – things they aren’t sharing with family and friend, no matter how caring and kind those family and friend may be. Nonetheless, it was a joy to be reminded of my childhood through Johnson’s telling of his.Would love to read a part two memoir by this author in another 20 years.Show more"

Also, this book is labeled as a “Young Adult” memoir, and I want to stress the Adult side of this label. While I agree with Johnson when he says in his author note that these are things many teens know and have experienced, there are some explicit sex scenes. Just know your child and what they’re ready for.This is a good primer for queer kids and allies. Through anecdotes, Johnson touches on a variety of queer experiences, especially through the lens of a person of color, from his life and the lives of other queer people in his family. He also touches on many topics common in the queer (and more specifically gay male) experience that are good for those around queer people to be aware of and that are good for queer people to know are shared happenings. I also really like the way he plays with narrative style depending on who he’s talking to.I did think this one was a little cheesy, and I didn’t think it quite earned the “Manifesto” label because I didn’t notice that it really outlined steps to take. The depictions of consensual sex here also had a little of that movie style of sex where neither foreplay or cleaning are discussed. While I get that they were likely the way things unfolded for Johnson, I wish he had brought them up since his goal with those scenes was to give a “birds and the bees” talk for gay boys. Also, while I get that community is important to those of us with minority identities and this is again Johnson’s truth, I didn’t like the level of defense for fraternities here.This is an excellent book to read if you’re raising a queer teen or to gift to your queer teen if you are raising them as a straight parent.Rating: 4/5Show more"

This memoir told in essays are centered in the author's own experiences as he navigates his own self-evolving identity in our world as a black queer young man. The memoir is divided into three sections following the author's childhood, adolescence, and current adulthood as he wrestles his pain and joy through life. He informs his reader that is not self involved to write a memoir at a very young age (33 years old), but had to write one in order to temporarily fill the vacuum of representation for young queer boys of color and to live his own truth. The journey of Johnson's activism is full of highs and lows as he understands the labels placed upon him by himself and by society. His essays and personal experiences touches upon many tough topics such as toxic masculinity, sexual abuse, institutional violence, and the dual fear of being both black and queer when both of these identities are neither safe. Though the topics are serious they add depth and realness to the essays and strengthens his call to all of us to help fight injustices in our society. I really appreciated his stance on the process of coming out to be cyclic instead of being finite and the necessity for inclusive sexual education that will help erase the stigma of queer relationships and ultimately help save lives. This is an important memoir that is a window for many and a critical mirror for black queer individuals.Show more"

In this book, Johnson explores his identities as a Black man and a queer man and conveys how his experiences in life have made him realize that it’s the intersection of the two that he’s had to accept. This is such a vulnerable work that includes topics such as consent, gender identity, structural marginalization, family, and more.I really cannot recommend this book more. The writing style is casual, concise but detailed, and will hold the attention of not just the young adults who are wanting to read this because they see themselves in this book but of anyone. It reads like a friend or mentor is sharing their life story with you. I’m always in awe of the people who write memoirs, but especially of Johnson who chose to share so many low moments of his life that he could have easily glossed over. His willingness to be vulnerable and help others who might experience the same things as him is evident in every chapter.One of the central themes of this book is the mask that Johnson has to wear throughout his life, and that almost all Black people have to wear at sometime or another. Some people call it code switching. It’s how people have to hide parts of themselves to fit into white and “traditional” spaces. It’s ultimately for safety—so that Black folk and queer folk (along with other POC and individuals on the spectrum) can exist safely in a world that is made for cis-white people. Y’all.

Cassie Gonzales did a fantastic job designing the cover as well. When I went to Palmer's website to see the original artwork without the lettering, I came upon a quotation that I felt it was vital to state at the top and incorporate. Unfortunately, the artwork was not on his website, but I did find a lot of other gorgeous black-themed artwork there, so I would recommend visiting his site at https://www.charlypalmer.com/. Visit Gonzales' website as well at https://www.casandragonzales.com/ while you're there.Since I have a habit of only reading reviews after finishing a book, I'm glad I opted to listen to the audiobook instead of the printed version because most reviews claim that the writing style makes it difficult to continue turning the pages, but I doubt that it would have negatively affected me but nonetheless, I think the audiobook is the best choice for anyone who would like to give this book a try. George Matthew Johnson is charismatic and well-spoken and he articulates each word with precision. The fantastic audiobook listening experience is enhanced by excellent audio recording and mastering.With the exception of the preface, the first five minutes of this book I spent yelling ""No!"" in opposition to the author. “Gender is one of the biggest projections placed onto children at birth, despite families having no idea how the baby will truly turn out. In our society, a person’s sex is based on their genitalia.” and continues to write “It’s as if the more visible LGBTQIAP+ people become, the harder the heterosexual community attempts to apply new norms.”Being cisgender, I've never had to deal with gender identity, therefore I may need to read books like these to learn about it from those who have. However, the author's assertions are based on a linear style of thinking, which ignores the expectations that families and parents have for a child's upbringing as well as from prenatal care and childbirth. And while affirmation is necessary for someone to feel secure in their identity, I know that a child's neutral upbringing might be confusing as well. I had to pause, read the book synopsis again, and was reminded that I actually picked up the book to learn and understand and needed to go in with an open mind. I quickly realized soon after it’s the manifesto parts of the book that I often feel like opposing and not the memoir sections of the book.My mind was opened by George Matthew Johnson's transparency. He claims to be ""a little embarrassed"" after discussing his first and second sex encounters, but when it comes to crazy sex tales in a book, Tiffany Hardish and Roscoe's story tops the list. Simply put, I found Johnson's narrative educational rather than humiliating. I do think this book will be a helpful guide for many young people trying to figure out who they are in a world with such a diverse sexual landscape.I liked the book but why would I only give it three stars? I almost gave it two stars. The second one throws around historic information like “Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees,” as the great Nina Simone would sing.” and move away from telling your own story, then you’ve got to do due diligence. When I googled ""Strange Fruit,"" this was the first result that came up: ""Strange Fruit"" is a song that was written and arranged by Lewis Allan and sung by Billie Holiday in 1939. Naturally, 26 years later, Nina Simone recorded her own cover. But the reason I give Billie's song a higher honor is not simply that it is the original song, but rather what it signified at the time Billie sang it.All Boys Aren't Blue contains 54 mentions of the word ""history."" I did this because when I listen to an audiobook, I have an eBook nearby to mark sections and statements that really stand out to me. “The fact that I couldn’t see my full self in Black heroes or the history books was more about the changing of history to spare white guilt than it ever was about me knowing the whole truth.” the author writes. I believe that when you write such things, you assume a great responsibility to convey historical events and their significance in the most authentic and unadulterated manner possible.All Boys Aren’t Blue is a book for all, not just queer people. It would be a great gift set for expecting parents paired with Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. But I highly recommend the audiobook as stated previously.

This is George Johnson’s journey towards taking ownership of their racial and sexual identities and their struggle to find self acceptance and self love. This is a story of their struggles, triumphs, aha moments and advice to young people, so they don’t have to feel alone in the world. Incredibly powerful, open and honest, I could not recommend this book more. It is a must read that will provide some of the crucial support Black and LGBTQIA+ young adults so righteously and justifiably need and deserve. I highly recommend this book to anyone who teaches or works with young adults so they read it and immediately put it in the hands of teenagers who need it. In the words of the author, “Sometimes all it takes is someone seeing you as you are.”Show more"

Johnson!ALL BOYS AREN’T BLUE is the author’s memoir (read by the author on audio as well) written as a series of essays about his experiences growing up in the intersection of being both Black and queer. It touches on difficult subjects from intense bullying and abuse by neighborhood kids as a child, his first experiences in sexual relationships both good and bad, and losses in the author’s life. Johnson sets out to provide resources too to youth in similar situations, resources he did not have himself as he was growing up.It is always tough to try to review someone’s personal experiences in a book, but I can say that this one was very well written and the audio was fantastic. It isn’t always an easy read, there is difficult content along the way and the author doesn’t shy away from saying that he doesn’t have all the answers. The author grew up in an accepting family which of course not everyone has. Even so, his discussions of the lack of resources, from sex education to support networks in general was eye opening.

It does all this and more. To me it is just so boring though. From describing the minutia of fraternity initiation, to telling us that great memories were made, but not relying on strong anecdotes, to just being very explicit in explaining what every life event means, this book was a struggle to get through. I wanted to like it so hard.Unlike other reviewers, I’m glad the author included the explicit sexuality in the book, because of how little in the world (and literature) delivers accurate portrayals of sex for gay teens/MLM. The content of this bio and it’s perspective is valuable. The delivery is my issue—it felt like listening to someone ramble without much focus on FB live /Stories/tiktok for hours. Maybe relatable to teens, but redundant, lacking the snap of wit, and feeling weirdly self aggrandizing at times. The prose just feels poorly constructed. I’d be interested in listening to teen readers talk about it—I’m of course far from the target audience.Show more"

The content is heavy, for sure, but to say that everything in this book is necessary would be an understatement. The intersectionality between Blackness and Queerness is something that has to be discussed. So many Black members of the LGBTQIAP+ community don't have the chance to experience the love or community that George talks about in this book and I hope that this book is one step in letting them know that they aren't alone and they are absolutely worthy of love, joy and happiness.For most of this, I felt like I was sitting with George, experiencing their life alongside them.

Johnson’s manifesto memoir, ALL BOYS AREN’T BLUE, he explores how he found his identity and how his identity is influenced by race. As an African American man identifying as queer, coming to this clarity was not easy for Johnson. A queer, African American identity is not commonly represented in communities or in media—there are racial and social barriers to deal with and overcome. Yet Johnson is incredibly candid and doesn't shy away from the difficulties that shaped him. With his writing, he provides an outlet for readers to see themselves through him, and the entire book has an authentic quality. The people we meet in his memoir are described so vividly, you’ll feel as though you know them personally. Some chapters will bring tears to your eyes, while others will make you grin with hope and joy. What is so important about this book is the social commentary. It acts as a mirror, allowing you to see how you've been influenced by society's expectations of sexuality, race, and definitions of masculinity/femininity. While your story may differ from his, Johnson offers such vivid descriptions and antidotes that the book can be relatable to anyone. His story provides a safe place where readers can feel welcome and understood as they venture forward on journeys that are rarely easy. Johnson’s voice is essential for both young and adult readers.Show more"

It changed my opinion on something that I have thought for decades.If I was to rate it on writing skills and organization, it would be lower, but how can you judge a memoir on that?

This memoir is a deeply personal look on growing up Black and queer. It's well written and has a lot of great paragraphs to highlight and memorize. I especially found Johnson's family dynamic interesting with how they were queer affirming yet imperfect. Really glad this book exists for queer and Black teens, I'd also recommend it to allies so as to better educate themselves.Trigger warnings: chapter eleven deals with graphic sexual assault, death, homophobia, racism, misgendering and deadnaming, assault, and some use of slurs.Content note: chapter fifteen has some pretty graphic sex scenes.Show more"

The grandmother sounded amazing. She always took George in and made time for them. Even when George had few friends. She saved on trips for all her grandkids. Unlike other memoirs, this is part memoir and part manifesto. They make a point to embrace who you truly are and love who feels right. Although there are some dark chapters of their life (TW: abuse), George still perseveres and finds something thoughtful to share. This is a great book for YA and adult readers because of George's powerful writing and ultimate message of acceptance. Show more"

Part love letter to his family and friends, part memoir advocating for black LGBT youth education, I'd give 5 stars for the author's story, but 3.5 for his writing style.

As a memoir this is definitely one of the top most engaging and entertaining reads for me. Not everyone’s life is interesting enough to write about or to even gain knowledge or wisdom from. I felt George’s life fit this mold completely. His coming of age memoir tells of a young, black, gay man finding his place in society and in his personal life. He navigates love, trust, insecurities, and fearlessness honestly. He is bold, funny, and downright graphic in his memoir and for that I rated this book ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!Show more"

It offers a fair and accurate representation of growing up as a black person in America while exploring the intersection of being a person of color and a part of the LGBTQ+ community. George's search for belonging is contrasted with a fiery desire to not be put down. His confidence gives me confidence. His struggles create a sense of solidarity knowing I/we am/are not alone. I also loved how he explained traits/features of the black experience from white-washed histories to greek organizations. Highly rec to everyone!Show more

I hope this book makes its way into the hands of many readers - those that need to see themselves reflected in the story and others who need to understand what life is like for someone who isn't exactly like them...or maybe someone they think isn't like them but is actually more like them than they realize.

The first is that my family was not ""queer-affirming,"" as Johnson calls it, and in fact was more of what he describes as ""would rather have a dead child than a gay one."" I also didn't have the molestation experiences he recounts in this book. But the overall broad sketch astounded me with its sameness.I, too, have a dad who was hospitalized for congestive heart failure. I also have hang-ups with swimming and being around water. Nothing dramatic, but I'm not a great swimmer and don't really like swimming. I grew up around flea marketing and swap meets, too, though the whole family was involved instead of just my grandma. My dad owned a flea market for many, many years, and we practically grew up there. While I didn't lust after a pair of cowboy boots for self-expression, I have a younger brother who preferred that ""Western"" style of dressing, something I never understood. Due to its association with cowboys, I always thought of it as ""white people stuff,"" something made for and by them, and a betrayal of Blackness. Though 100% straight, he's always enjoyed dressing up, and now that I'm older, I understand that dandy culture is a thing, and that no way of dressing makes you more or less Black. I can even liken his passion to my own obsession with Japanese street style and Lolita in high school. Though I never went as far as actually wearing any of it, it was a subculture of dress that, for a time, held a special intrigue for me.Anyway, I love that Johnson used his personal experiences as a gateway to talk about these issues in a broader social context, and how he claims space for his story and speaks it into power. Because he's absolutely right: we, as young Black queer people, did not have these stories growing up. We didn't have a blueprint, so we made our own way. Now the future generation won't have to be alone in their coming out, navigating sex and relationships, etc. They will have someone to look up to, and stories they can relate to that are readily available. I love that he emphasized the stigma around therapy and mental health in Black families. Most trauma is either ignored, bottled up, or just pushed to the side. All my life I heard ""suck it up,"" ""it's not that bad,"" ""you're okay,"" and the phrase ""crocodile tears."" My dad was fond of saying, ""What's crying gonna do?"" And then when that didn't work: ""You better stop crying!"" Then he would actually count down, after which point the sniffles and sobs better be contained, or else. It wasn't until much later that I understood crying as a necessary part of processing pain and not something shameful or pointless. And that's exactly what this book is: pain, processed beautifully. In order to heal from it, you have to actually feel it. I'm reminded of Rupi Kaur's words: ""the world gives you so much pain and here you are making gold out of it. there is nothing purer than that.""* * * QUOTES * * *If I couldn't see parts of my own Blackness as respectable, there was no way I was ready to see my queerness as respectable either. But now I know that queerness is a part of Blackness, and there is no Blackness without queer people.I often think about a statement Viola Davis made when she won her first Oscar. Something along the lines of encouraging people to go to the graveyard and dig up all the dead bodies in order to hear and tell stories of those whose dreams were never realized. Those are the stories she's interested in telling. Although that is valid, I must challenge it. This book is proof positive that you don't need to go to the graveyard to find us. Many of us are still here. Still living and waiting for our stories to be told, to tell them ourselves. We are the living that have always been here, but have been erased. We are the sons and brothers and daughters and sisters and others that never get a chance to see ourselves, nor to raise our voices to ears that need to hear them. Therapy is still very much a taboo subject in the Black community. Those who are seen as having issues with their mental health face a lot of stigma and discrimination, because mental health is often conflated with mental illness.Our community struggles to connect with joy in the way that we have with pain. When I hear Cardi B. say, ""she got a bag and fixed her teeth,"" it's more than just a cute line in a dope song. And yes, Bodak Yellow was a bop. But she is responding to years of hate and flack she received for having crooked teeth. She is talking about the trauma she dealt with, and what she was able to do to gain back agency over those moments, and then use it in a way to make folks proud. Every time she speaks about her teeth, she allows herself to work through the process of healing, rather than be burdened by the weight of holding the trauma in.When you're a child that is different, there always seems to be a something. You can't switch, you can't say that, you can't act this way. There is always a something that must be erased, and with it, a piece of you. The fear of being that vulnerable again outweighs the happiness that comes with being who you are, and so you agree to erase that something.But those who participate in homophobia create kids who do the same. Homophobia denies queer people happiness. I imagine there are a lot of queer people who would've loved to play sports or do traditional masculine activities, but they hold themselves back based on a fear of interacting with people they can't trust. People who have made it very clear that queer people are unwelcome, despite the fact they have talent.American history is truly the greatest fable ever written.Symbolism gives folks hope. But I've come to learn that symbolism is a threat to actual change. It's a chance for those in power to say, ""Look how far you have come."" Rather than admitting, ""Look how long we stopped you from getting here.""In Rose Hackman's article in the Guardian on post-segregation public swimming pools, she explains how Black kids drown at roughly three times the rate of white kids due to lack of resources, both tangible and cultural, as well as racism. It's interesting how many things in this country white kids do as a given, but Black kids continue to struggle with for generations. Black folks have always had a complicated connection to water, and even a fear of it dating back to our enslavement. My ancestors were brought here on boats, stowed away in holds, without being able to see anything. But they could hear water beating on the hull outside. I imagine that the last sound many of my ancestors heard was the rush of water. Even when the enslaved were able to break free from their shackles, many of them chose to jump overboard and die at sea rather than be held in bondage. Consider recent American history. After the integration of public swimming pools, pools were filled with cement or simply closed in predominately Black areas. This prevented Black families and their children from learning to swim. That is the type of social pathology that runs through us. Find a flaw, deficit, or disadvantage in our community, and I can find a system that oppressed us and made it that way.I often imagine what my first sexual experiences would've been like had I been given the ability to learn about what queer sex was when all my straight friends and classmates got to learn about what it looked like for them. My queer sexuality was one big, risky crash course, much like the other aspects of my queer existence. There is so much danger in not providing proper education about sex to kids, especially those who are having sex outside of the heteronormative boxes.I released the deepest and darkest things about my past, in the hopes that someone might see a reflection of themselves in the words, and know that they are not alone, and they too can grow and thrive. And so that they may not make the many missteps I took along the road.Show more"

Johnson, highlighting the challenges of growing up Black and queer in America. The memoir delves into the complexities of identity, sexuality, and societal pressures, providing a candid exploration of Johnson's personal journey. Childhood: Honeychild- Johnson's early years are marked by a sense of difference, with their use of ""Honeychild"" challenging gender norms and leading to discomfort among adults.- Despite some pushback, Johnson's family, especially their grandmother, provided crucial support and love, fostering a sense of acceptance.Teenage years: Shame and secrecy- Johnson grapples with conflicting identities, struggling to reconcile their Black identity with societal expectations of masculinity.- Suppressing their queerness and navigating their first sexual experiences in secrecy, Johnson confronts the trauma and shame associated with their early sexual encounters.College: Coming out and finding freedom- Johnson's college experience brings new opportunities for self-discovery, including joining a fraternity and forming strong bonds with other Black men.- Exploring their sexuality more openly, Johnson engages in consensual sexual experiences that shape their understanding of identity and desire.Throughout the narrative, Johnson confronts societal taboos and challenges, including the lack of representation, inadequate sex education, and the stigmatization of LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly within the Black community. By sharing their experiences, Johnson aims to foster a sense of community and understanding, advocating for better support systems and education for marginalized youth.While ""All Boys Aren't Blue: A Memoir-Manifesto"" by George M. Johnson has been lauded for its raw and honest portrayal of the author's personal experiences, it could be argued that the book should be rated 1 star due to its explicit content, which has led to controversy and censorship in various educational settings. Some critics also argue that the graphic depictions of sexual encounters, including instances of abuse and underage sexual activity, may not be suitable for a younger audience. Additionally, the book's focus on sensitive and potentially triggering subject matter, such as familial trauma and internalized homophobia, could be seen as detrimental to readers' mental well-being, especially those who may have had similar traumatic experiences. Furthermore, the book's narrative style, which delves into intimate details without providing sufficient context or reflection, has been criticized for potentially glorifying or normalizing harmful behavior without adequately addressing the consequences or offering a clear path toward healing and growth.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4582313-esm,All Boys Aren’t Blue,No Rating,"February 14, 2022",2 likes,0,"TW: homophobia, sexual assault, violence, transphobia, racismNot sure how to rate this as it's such a personal memoir and is obviously based around the author's experiences. It did feel like a message had to tie up every chapter neatly and I felt like some of them were a bit contrived, because life is messy! Sadly, not everything has a reason and I think a few stories in here could have been presented with that in mind, rather than trying to find a moral to try justify why the author included it - the only justification needed is that it is something that happened in their life and that's what this book is about. I also didn't like the author using the deadname and incorrect pronouns of their transgender cousin; I appreciate that they discussed using the terms as they understood them at the points in time they're remembering including when they didn't fully understand her transition, but I think respecting their identity is more important than that, particularly as the cousin has sadly passed away and isn't able to express consent. The author themselves came out as non-binary in 2019 after the publication of this book, so I wonder if they would perhaps approach that chapter differently if they wrote it today.Those two issues aside, this is a painfully honest memoir that is written simply, but beautifully. The chapter about the passing of one of their fraternity brothers really choked me up as someone who recently lost a friend far too young. I liked how it was broken into childhood, high school and college, particularly as the author had such different experiences at their various schools and almost felt like they had a different identity at each one; the culmination of all those various stages of life into the person they are now was a really lovely encapsulation of how complicated and difficult being a young person is, especially one trying to find themselves as a Black, queer person. The afterword where they talk about how if their book helps one person it'll be a success to them is just wonderful and I imagine their work has helped many, many more than that. You can almost feel the catharsis of the author as they write and I hope they found the experience of writing this memoir to be a positive one that helped them come to terms with some of the things they explore in the book. Most of all, I really felt that their dedication and warmth towards their friends and family is so visceral throughout. The overall impression I had when I finished this book was that it was a love letter to them.Show more"

I don’t read a lot of non-fiction, as I am very picky with it. But I went into All Boys Aren’t Blue blindly and without much thinking, as I saw so many people raving about this book and recommending it. I can safely say that everyone was so right about this book as it was absolutely fantastic to read. Quick heads-up: As there is a lot to unpack, this review is really long. I inserted some of the quotes I loved to separate the different sections, so it wouldn’t be one big wall of text.All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson is a YA memoir-manifesto, meaning this book is about George M. Johnson’s life, but they expand on their memories and life experiences, adding advice, life lessons and philosophy about being different, toxic masculinity, family, gender, intersecting marginalised identities, consent and Black joy. What makes it YA is that this memoir-manifesto is both not as densely written as most adult books are, but also as the book is directly aimed at young people. George M. Johnson said they wrote this book as it was a book they needed when they were young, making sure young people who might need have it.I listened to the audiobook on Scribd and the whole experience was phenomenal. The author is also the narrator, adding a layer of emotion and sincerity on top of the written story itself. Hearing the story out of their own mouth made it seem more real, at some points it felt like I was with George M. Johnson when it all happened, seeing everything happening. I was so immersed and sucked into the story, that the whole thing really made an impact on me and how I see myself and others.“Navigating in a space that questions your humanity isn’t really living at all. It’s existing. We all deserve more than just the ability to exist.”It’s weird to say that I saw myself in a book that is literally a bundle of essays of someone else’s life, but I want to elaborate on that. The foremost theme of All Boys Aren’t Blue was marginalization, about not fitting in with most of society. George M. Johnson talks in their essays how intersecting marginalized identities create unique experiences, often much harder than if you’d add up those identities if they were on their own. They say that it’s one thing to be queer and one thing to be Black, but being a Black queer is just something else entirely. And this goes for any and all intersections. That whole statement just reached something in me, some sort of inner acceptance that it’s okay to admit that it can be a struggle, but also that you can inspire, teach and learn. I can relate to fellow bis, I can relate to fellow aspecs, I can relate to fellow autistics, but those don’t represent who I am. One identity influences the other and it’s different for everyone else.This topic really helped me personally, it helped me be more peaceful about who I am and that I am not broken, no matter how society will make me feel.“Many of us connect with each other through trauma and pain: broken people finding other broken people in the hopes of fixing one another.”This book is beautiful, but it’s also A LOT. I listed a list of content warnings at the start of the post, but even knowing those, it might still be a lot. I am usually someone who can handle most things without or with limited issues, but this book really got me. It deals with trauma, phobia, discrimination and more tough subjects. These are important topics, especially for young folks to learn about them, but also to show they aren’t the only ones experiencing that.I want to specifically address the start of Act 3: Teenagers, which is chapter 11: Boys Will Be Boys (Chapter 15 on the Scribd audiobook). There is more to be said about this chapter than the content warnings, as it’s the combination of them that make it so heavy. In the section below I have gone into more detail about this chapter. It can be considered a spoiler, but your safety while reading is more important.Detailed description of the content warnings and the chapter itself:Before writing this, I relistened to the chapter to make sure I cover it all. Content warnings of this chapter: Incest, rape, sexual abuse, sexual assault, trauma.Can you skip it? Yes, you can skip the entire chapter without missing information to enjoy the rest of the book. If you listen to the audiobook, the intro of the chapter ends at 2:04min into chapter 11 (Chapter 15 on Scribd) if you want to listen to that.Click on the spoiler tag to see my detailed explanation: In this chapter George talks about what happened between him and his (now passed away) cousin. As the content warning of incest warned for, the boys engage in sexual acts with eachother, which is the first sexual act and first gay act the narrator has experienced. Though in theory the narrator enjoys what is happening and isn't physically forced to do anything, he never consented and was mostly confused about what was happening. Thereby, he was just 13 years old and couldn't give proper consent. This is rape at worst, which it definitely was, and it was sexual assault at best. The narrator was just 13 when it happened, cousin was a bit older, they shared the bottom bunk bed and another cousin was sleeping on the top bed. It starts with the cousin touching the narrator and having the narrator touch him. Several times when the cousin ask the narrator to do something, the narrator says no first, but the cousin pushes a second time and then the narrator complies. This chapter walks a fine line between enjoying something you know is wrong, but also discomfort stemmed from knowing it is wrong and internalised homophobia sprinkled on top.“I believe that the dominant society establishes an idea of what “normal” is simply to suppress differences, which means that any of us who fall outside of their “normal” will eventually be oppressed.”I can probably fill an hour long presentation just talking about this book, but I am going to wrap it up here. I really recommend everyone to go and read this beautiful memoir-manifesto. And I really recommend to pick up the audiobook (it’s available on Scribd) as, like I said, the author narrates it and it really adds something to the whole experience. The message, the story, all of it is so important. Even if you aren’t too big of a fan of non-fiction, I am positive you will still love it as it is just so much more than just an author talking about themselves.Read more reviews on my blog:https://servillasspeaks.wordpress.comShow more"

I didn’t know what it meant at the time, but I now know it was okay to be that different kid. That being different didn’t mean something was wrong with me, but that something was wrong with my cultural environment which forced me to live my life as something that I wasn’t.” (Kindle 4%)When this one came off hold at the public library two weeks early it was a sign I definitely should be reading this one, this month and yay I am so glad I can...During Pride Month when the LGBTQ community celebrates their existence and their quest for equal rights this book has the potential and power to be so powerful for any child questioning their gender or sexual identity---and it starts off holding nothing back and getting right into what it means to identify your gender and how it is basically thrown at you based on your genitalia…“Gender-reveal parties have become a trendy way to celebrate the child’s fate, steering them down a life of masculine and feminine ideals before even meeting them….(Kindle 2%)Very powerful perspective that I also hold onto--vaginas=girls and penises=boys but this is just what I have been socially conditioned to and the existence of the LGBTQ community shatters that entirely..The book starts off with the birth of this boy who at first glance is assumed to be a girl because of the headful of beautiful black curls however his penis would forever mark him as a boy to his family despite what he feels or wants….In the introduction it is beautifully stated that this work is intended to help gay black children in America by sharing how the interlapping of both identities of black and gay created both privilege and oppression with no room to hide or deny being either- how neither of those identities can be contained within a simple box and that in every room they are both there despite the spaces and environment….the intersection of Blackness and queerness and the double oppression that generates.He goes into being not only queer but black and gives the example of saying the n-word which makes me cringe everytime I hear it--like me he grew up comfortable with saying it and then on reflection removed the word from his vocabulary as he began to feel as I do--”the word has too much hatred in it for us to ever be able to take back full ownership in any variation and is tied to the most painful parts of history in America……….I understand now that there is no such thing as a “respectable negro” in the eyes of society, now was I ever made to be one.” (Kindle 3%)Each chapter is titled to detail an experience --with the first chapter encompassing identity and I really like his description of his childhood as he grew up basically just like me---“We were blessed to have parents who understood what it was like to have the bare minimum, and who ensured that their kids never experienced that same plight.” (Kindle 7%)He later goes on to say that no matter how he grew up and what type of upbringing and support system his life story is proof that no amount of money, love or support can support you when you don’t know who you are or why….Matthew talks about his identity and how he always saw himself as a girl or a grown woman--“I rarely, if ever, imagined myself in daydreams as a boy growing older. In my daydreams, I got to live as who I felt I was” (Kindle 19%)The chapter on Gay Lingo was also really intriguing as he brings up the double standard of children being told to stop talking like that and ostracized for using though it has made its way to social media and television for people to use it out of context safely..He comes under scrutiny for coining the phrase “honeychild” among his friends which the adults had issue with---as he states correctly many adults are still uncomfortable with boys who do anything no considered “masculine”...Adding to his list of differences he always felt there was something about him to be changed or erased..his word was a threat to the identity of their kids--all because he wasn’t a typical “boy” who wanted to speak his way and the only time he was told he couldn’t do something or was chastised was when it was too feminine…“I realized the only place that was truly safe for me would be in my imagination..and I began wearing the mask to hide who I really was…” (Kindle 21%)“Football was the highlight of most boys’ days. Unless you were a boy named Matthew Johnson.” (Kindle 22%)During recess Matthew decided to jump double dutch with the girls though being the only boy there he knew this was not considered acceptable and he learned how to “code-switch” between girls and boys quite easily….until the day a boy confronted him about doing ‘girl things’ and he is called a fag and has to decide if he will fight or walk away and essentially admit he is gay..The chapter about school and I related so much to this one also because like me, all his teachers and administrators were primarily White and only once a year was the focus on Black History as White history didn’t need a month and was taught all year round..“Abraham Lincoln was taught to me as a man who truly cared about Black people, and I don’t remember a single Black student back then who didn’t hold him in the highest regard…..“It was easy to pay homage back then to white historical figures because we learned about them through the lens that they were concerned about us all.” (Kindle 30%)“It’s not always about how teachers view history, but how they view you. And your place in history.” (Kindle 30%)“The greatest tool you have in fighting the oppression of your Blackness and queerness and anything else within your identity is to be fully educated on it.” (Kindle 35%)Moving seamlessly through his puberty and middle school to high school graduation the book talks about his greatest influences in his mother and grandmother Nanny, his relationships that strengthened him and never judged though they didn’t understand and his first sexual experience as a victim...Going to a predominantly white high school he speaks on micro-aggressions and culture vultures--white students who want to be down with everything black except the stigma and problems…“My culture was a joke to them the entire time I was in high school-something that they could play with while never suffering the oppression that those who created it did.” (Kindle 73%)I will be forever enlightened on the plight of queer black boys and men everywhere after reading this..It really is an adult read especially with the graphic but very relevant and needed sexual discovery he described..He wrote this book so other boy would feel as alone and unprepared as he was and I hope the intended audience gets what they need, I empathize and have learned so much about how to be a better ally and never really realized the challenges they endure simply from trying to be them and now what is expected of them..powerful reading...now to my next library read.the holds keep coming in!!Show more"

I loved the trans colours being the background. The baby pink and the baby blue with the white lettering is just perfection! The portrait of the black boy also strongly conveys strength along with blackness and queerness. Kudos to Charly Palmer, the artist!The book itself in a interesting memoir of a black queer experience. George M. Johnson is very honest and forthright about their journey and the goals they had in writing this book. They convey the dynamics of growing queer and black in all its multitude. The book has some important lessons that make you think. I was particularly struck by some things like choosing a name for yourself if you're not happy with the one you've been given. It's something we almost never think about. One thing that I perhaps had a minor problem was with George M. Johnson's take on masculinity. They decided to do traditionally masculine things like join a football team and a fraternity in order to prove that masculinity isn't limited to traditional ideas - to prove that a femme person could also be a part of these things. I just wish there had been more emphasis on this not being the journey that everybody needs to take. Femme people can embrace their own selves and enjoy being just that too. Usually George had taken time to explain this even as they were presenting their journey. Just because this was their journey does not mean it has to be for everyone else. I just wish they had done more of this here too. Overall I can understand the importance of this book existing. If I had come to this book as a younger person I'm sure the lessons I learned from it would have been much more impactful. I'm happy that younger queer people now have access to such stories so that they can navigate their own journey better and this was George M. Johnson's biggest goal. Needless to say, they have perfectly achieved this.Show more"

We journey from an early memory of having his teeth kicked in at five years old to dealing with the death of a close friend at college and, along the way, get to hear about family members and the various events that he recalls shaping him as he grew up.I was struck, more than anything, by the love and strength gained from family. Things may not have always been articulated, but there’s a clear sense that when it counted they would have your back. You might be held to account, but you would always be loved - and it strikes me that this may well be the best gift you can give someone.So many of the memories were tinged with sadness and made me feel angry that they had to be experienced, but if all of us were to pinpoint moments that shaped us I’m sure that not all of them would be positive. As so eloquently written in the latter stages of the book, reading about the experiences of others can help us define ourselves and for this reason alone I would recommend this book. While so much was nothing like my own experiences, that search for yourself and the need to find your family will resonate with most readers.I’m in awe of Nanny and the devotion she has so clearly inspired. I feel privileged to have been allowed to see inside our author’s head, and grateful to have been given this opportunity.Show more"

And I'll be honest, I understand the discomfort some people have with it. It is explicit. Johnson tells you right at the beginning what he is doing; he is giving young people what he did not have. Advice and help for when the bad things happen to them, for when they don't understand sexual experiences, for when they don't know if what they are going through is normal. It's written in very accessible language, maybe even a bit too elementary for my taste, but it's all with intention. Johnson talks us through experiencing assault, verbal and physical abuse, finally coming out and how tortuous that whole process was. It's a hard read, it's a vulnerable read, but it's an extremely hopeful and uplifting read. He gives the youthful queer person the clear, straightforward this is what's up that honestly is so needed. He explains how someone he cared about hurt him, in detail. He says, without qualification: that is wrong what he did to me. Also, I love him, and I think someone hurt him the same way. But that doesn't change that what he did was wrong, and that he hurt me in a way that took a long time to heal. That plain language snapped the tension around my heart after I read about his terrible encounter with an older male that he loved so much and trusted.I will never support the banning of books, and it's because people like Johnson were hunting for someone, anyone, to explain what was happening and had happened to them. So he did that. He did it lovingly, clearly, and yes, with explicit details so that no one could misunderstand. I treasure that. I do think it needs to be process with someone else, but some young people don't have that, so at least they have this. That's all I got.Show more"

I'm sometimes weary of young folks who write memoirs because I sometimes don't believe they've lived enough life or experienced enough life to be able to write a memoir; however, the catalyst behind George writing this book was clearly for a bigger mission than just talking about his life. He wants his life experiences to help people understand the challenges of self-discovery at such a young age, and navigating sexuality and relationships.George talks a great deal about his childhood and adulthood and breaks down the various feelings he had along the way regarding his sexuality and having the support of his family and friends. I'm glad that he experienced queer-affirming from his family and friends, especially his family who he speaks very highly of. I loved the personal letters that he wrote to his brother, his grandmother, and even the cousin who took advantage of him at a young age. I know this book is banned in many areas of our country and while there are some very intimate experiences being shared in this book that may make some uncomfortable, I think the focus needs to remain on this young man's inspiring journey. I can feel that he genuinely wants to be an inspiration to young queer people, especially boys who know what they identify as and want to live in their truth with support from those closest to them. George is comfortable in his skin, his truth, and his knowledge of how he can use his platform to help others.Show more"

Banned books are the ones that often hold the stories that more conservative folks don't want told - and those are the exact stories I want to read and to make sure are around for others to read. This is absolutely one of those books. The author says, “I realised that the more I hold back, the more harm happens to the next generation who needs this information. Which weighs more: the weight of me having to be a little more vulnerable or the weight that I’d feel if I kept something back, and have to watch someone be harmed because I said nothing?”. And so they tell so many of their truths - about violence and sexual assault, about being raised in a loving family and still worrying about coming out, about sex and desire and being honest with yourself, about being Black and gay in a culture that targets you for either of those identities. While I thought that the book could have used more editing, I loved the honesty and the voice that shone through. I found this great interview with the author at https://www.npr.org/2022/10/25/113043... and totally recommend taking a listen. As they put it, ""The book is about growing up Black and queer, and always feeling different but not having the words to express it.

I knew what it felt like to experience the hardest loss in your life. I knew joy and I knew pain. I knew triumph and I knew trauma. Most importantly, I knew the road that lay ahead of me, with many more obstacles to cross and barriers to break down. And although I had lived a full life, I knew there was still a lot more life I needed to live.""This memoir touches on the author's trauma (i.e. physical violence against him because of his identity), his sexual awakening (later in his life, due to the general stigma surrounding the LGBTQIA+ community), the death of a loved one (a beloved friend from college), and the importance of family during a time when he was isolated and experiencing a dark state of depression and loneliness. The author writes with a very mature voice, particularly for someone who has experienced a lot of hardships and has a lot of reasons to be angry. In fact, the author's maturity is probably the aspect that I love most about this memoir... especially as it pertains to his experience with sexual coercion at a young age (13). His perspective is one of forgiveness and understanding... which... amazing. Absolutely awe-inspiring.The author's perspective is certainly an important one, and it's not one that I notice too often in published books.

So many are by or about marginalized groups. George M. Johnson says at the beginning of All Boys Aren't Blue: This book will touch on sexual assault (including molestation), loss of virginity, homophobia, racism and anti-Blackness.

This book offers insight into the intersectionality of being black and queer, in which the author shares many stories of their own experiences with being black and queer amongst the white community and queer within the black community. I found the chapters about their family particularly moving and powerful. Due to the content in this book, I would probably recommend this book to older queer teenagers and young adults who are still in college (specifically those of colour, and those who are non-binary, trans, or gay) who are struggling with gender and sexual identity. The book does go into quite a bit of sexual detail as it serves as a resource for younger queer readers who may not have anyone to give them ""the talk"" about having safe and pleasurable queer relationships. ***

Nous avons tous des cultures, des cultes, des sensibilités et des expériences qui nous rendent unique même si l’on fait tous en sorte de rentrer dans « les normes » de notre époque.J’étais extrêmement curieuse de découvrir le parcours de Georges M. Johnson. Je suis assez ignorante de la culture LGBTQIA+, le fait qu’iel se livre est à la fois touchant, poignant, par moment terrible mais ce qu’il en ressort pour moi c’est tout de même beaucoup de tristesse.J’avoue que certains épisodes m’ont profondément marquée voire même dérangée car je n’ai pas compris et j’ai entamé une réflexion sur ces moments, cependant ça m’a donné l’occasion de réaliser la chance que j’avais eu dans ma jeunesse et ma construction d’avoir une famille et un entourage ouvert d’esprit,. Pas de charge mentale juste la liberté de se construire et d’apprendre sans pression.Cette autobiographie est faite pour réagir, sur le positif ou le négatif mais clairement on s’interroge très souvent et même si je ne suis pas d’accord avec certains des propos qu’iel tient, je peux tout à fait l’entendre et même comprendre le cheminement qu’iel a fait pour aujourd’hui s’assumer et vivre pleinement le fait d’être noir et queer.Les anecdotes de vie avec sa Nanny sont celles que j’ai le plus aimées, j’ai trouvé ces passages doux, emprunts de bonté et de bienveillance et j’imagine que c’est ainsi que GMJ a voulu nous les transcrire. Ceux concernant la communauté noire m’ont parfois fait mal, et j’avoue qu’en tant que blanche dans un pays européen, je n’avais pas la possibilité de tout comprendre mais ici, j’ai été choquée, surprise et parfois révoltée. Les États Unis d’Amérique c’est le pays de l’ambiguïté qui est à la fois très fière de sa jeune construction mais où les clivages entre communautés sont effrayants. La violence, le fait de ne faire étalage que des beaux moments de l’histoire, la discrimination raciale entre autre chose laisse vraiment le lecteur s’interroger et se remettre en question.J’espère juste que le chemin de l’acceptation est plus simple pour d’autres, que les mentalités évolueront bien plus vite dans les années à venir et que l’humain sera enfin capable de voir dans les différences de chaque être, mixité raciale, culte … une force et non un sujet à peur et persécution.J’ai terminé ma lecture ne sachant pas si j’aimais ou pas ce que j’avais lu, je pense d’ailleurs que la balance penche plus vers le moins que le plus. Mais je suis heureuse d’avoir pu apprendre de ses expériences et très honorée qu’iel est décidée de nous livrer des souvenirs aussi personnels que ceux-là. N’hésitez pas à découvrir son parcours, ses convictions c’est bien de sortir de sa zone de confort et de se remettre en question.Show more"

And yet it was still captivating and made me think and feel deeply (for example, it reminds me again that I will eventually have to grieve the passing of my loved ones, so I should cherish them now while I can).

Not to put the book on trial, but to see how it sat with me.There's a lot of good and necessary things in this book. It illustrates the life of a queer Black millennial, growing up in a family that simply accepts him as he is. This acceptance alone is a departure from what themes publishers are willing to explore. The writing style is for young adults, and it doesn't resonate for me the way I'm sure it will resonate for its intended audience.I did not appreciate the misgendering and dead naming of his cousin Hope. It's possible that Hope's identity was more fluid than what is described. If that's the case, I think an explanation would have been helpful to know that the author is referring to his late cousin in a way she would have appreciated.Regarding the passages that bring concern. The first is a description of childhood sexual assault by an older family member. The author describes his body responding in a way that many sexual assault survivors' bodies respond. These responses cause survivors to question whether what happened to them was assault, and delay or prevent them from seeking resources. It is vital and protective for young people to know that even if their bodies respond in these ways they are STILL survivors. This point is reaffirmed in the text.Other scenes do include consensual sexual activities. If these passages pass for erotica, then my 3 bedroom bungalow can pass for a palace.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

There is some sexual content and there are descriptions of traumatic events. I can see why one would want to be thoughtful and responsible about young kids reading those chapters.

Johnson's voice is super authentic and specific. He describes the complicated joy and pain of growing up queer and Black in a family that wasn't perfect but by and large supported him. I think the explicit descriptions of sex will be too much for certain school communities who don't allow any sex on the page, but that would be a huge missed opportunity for kids to learn about a young gay man's sexual experiences. Johnson makes the incredibly urgent point that queer kids don't learn what they need to about sex in school, a huge social justice issue, and it would go a long way for all kids to learn more about it since it's impossible to know every kid's sexual identity or gender expression. Johnson is incredibly smart, and it's clear he knew what he needed and wanted to say. This would be a great book for any young person to read, but especially make sure your queer teens get their hands on it.I'd especially recommend it on audio since he reads the book himself, but there was a lot to underline, so maybe buy the print book and listen to it on audio from the library.Show more"

He speaks frankly about his family, his childhood, bullying in school, his beloved grandmother, his first sexual experiences (both good and bad), and ultimately finding his place in the world. The censors are having temper tantrums over the sex discussed in this book, but it is truly an essential part of this book. George struggles with the things that so many queer kids deal with - sureness, consent, fear, and the fact that queer kids are left to essentially figure things out on their own since queer sex ed is not taught.

George M Johnson's experiences speak to queer youngsters everywhere, but I especially loved the portrayal of intersectionality in their identities as black and queer. The book is targeted towards young adults, and they talk about identity, abuse, bullying, exploring sex and sexuality, acceptance and the lack of it, relationships with family members, and community, with a lot of honesty, vulnerability and empathy.

It’s also a “window” for anyone who chooses to look through it, to open it wide and let the fresh air come in. The writer offers a very necessary and rare point of view, and it is both moving and inspiring. It’s also sometimes very funny, and often very emotional…but never maudlin or exploitative.

The descriptions in this book are very matter of fact and almost written as emotionless bullet lists. What the author does write about are very real life experiences, such as being assaulted by a family member in middle school. They also describe their first consensual encounters (which happen as an adult over 21.) This book should definitely be in high school libraries. If the author was experiencing sexual assault at 13, other teenagers are as well and could use reassurance that they are not to blame and they are not alone. One in 9 girls and 1 in 53 boys under the age of 18 experience sexual abuse or assault. Having the book in Middle school is less certain for me. The adult themes could be troubling for a child of 11, especially if they don't have trusted adults to ask questions of. On the other hand struggling teens could use a roadmap to topics like consent and safe behavior before they are placed in those situations.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

Despite this book being honest to the Author, I found myself relating to so many of the experiences he had with his family, school and coming to oneself, like MANY children. Despite this being on the chopping block for parents who want to shelter their children or ban this story for it's graphic material, this book doesn't push the boundaries in a way that's harmful to any child. It does the opposite, and validates the feelings that developing children and teens face in environments where enormous parts of their identity are not addressed. It confirms why something that might have happened to you in a confusing time, was bad and wrong. It also confirms that identity is your own- something that children need, even if their environment wants to strip that agency and identity away from them. They hold the power to their own truths and they deserve to be validated. I absolutely loved the flow of this book. An introduction into the chapter with a personal story of George's and inside, will be something historic, and backed by facts. This is a memoir but its' also grounded in truth and confirmation from the world we live in.I loved reading the bits about how LGBTQ culture was derived from the black queer scene, what aspects of black history we still hold onto today, and the expansion and explanation of queer theory, so that a reader who isn't caught up to speed, isn't lost!fabulous read!!

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11364493-sarah,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 3 out of 5,"May 7, 2022",2 likes,0,"Next in my lineup of banned books was a big one, George M. Johnson's All Boys Aren't Blue, a book I had the privilege of contributing to in my own little under-the-hood-only way. It's been banned across the country pretty much from the moment it published. I need to stress that my three-star rating is only because this book didn't ring all the bells in the melody that I, as an individual, like in my reading. I think this is mostly because the book is aimed at a YA audience and is, as the author himself points out, a memoir by someone only in his thirties. My biggest disconnect is that I like my nonfiction with more interpersonal details. For example, Johnson tells us that his mother chose a cousin of hers who was a lesbian to be Johnson's godmother, and speculates that perhaps his mother did this so he'd have someone on his side (and dang, do I wish I'd saved that quote). But we're not given any evidence that Johnson interacted with his godmother at all--no story of a moment when they met, never mind connected. Johnson also tells us that one of his cousins was trans, and while we do hear how his mother and grandmother accepted her, all he tells us about his own interaction with her is that he preferred talking with her and her girlfriends when the family got together at a picnic. A few more stories and details about how her presence and death impacted Johnson emotionally might have helped me connect to him better.On a lower-order level, I zigzagged between feeling talked down to--Jim Crow was explained in about two sentences as a series of laws meant to keep Black people down--but also expected to have a high level of knowledge already, like an understanding that microaggressions add up to trauma, and that trauma doesn't just mean physical harm. I have a feeling that a teen's knowledge of U.S. history and the many forms racism can take varies widely by geography and privilege.But look, all of that is personal to me and my reading preferences. What Johnson sets out to do in his book, as he says, is show kids who might be like was--queer boys, particularly black queer boys--that there's someone like them who's had experiences they might relate to and who has not only survived, but ultimately thrived, even if confused and closeted well into college. And that, I think, makes this book profoundly important for teens. Yeah, maybe its relative shortness leaves it a bit scant on the details, but I also think that allows room for kids to project themselves onto Johnson's experiences. And that includes the scenes that ""concerned citizens"" are decrying as pornographic: a time in his preteens when an older cousin sexually abuses him, and his major ""firsts"" of consensual intercourse with other men. Yes, these scenes are explicit, if by explicit you mean that they include words like ""penis"" and ""ejaculate"", and a frank explanation of what happened and what it physically felt like. This isn't a blow-by-blow how-to-guide, but more a clinical, this-is-what-happened, this-is-how-it-felt-physically, just-the-facts-please way. These scenes aren't meant to titillate. True, they would probably fascinate and, yeah, maybe turn on a teen who hasn't been exposed to much explicit content, but compared to erotica or porn, it's small potatoes.Ever since I finished this book I've been thinking about whether I would be comfortable with a teenager of my own--particularly a gay son--reading these scenes in this book. And I think I've arrived at the conclusion that, yes, I would be okay with it, and would hope that they'd feel comfortable enough to talk to me about it. In my own experience, the soft-focus, super-vague love and sex scenes in what I read as a teen--both YA and adult--were uninformative and unrealistic. Johnson's book isn't a guide to sex and consent (I actually would have liked a little more discussion of the latter), but at least it's real and honest. I'll leave Johnson himself to discuss his reasons for getting so personal about his private life: go read his interview in TIME about his memoir and its subsequent banning.I don't think I've ever read nonfiction or memoirs specifically targeted at a YA audience--I kind of skipped straight from middle grade to adult nonfiction--so I really don't have anything to compare with All Boys Aren't Blue. And, okay, yes, I'm very much not the target audience: I'm a heteroromantic white woman in my 30s who was either oblivious to or perplexed by my friends' crushes when I was a teenager. I've also been trying harder to educate myself in the past few years, so a lot of the concepts that Johnson introduces as though new--as they very might well be, to a teen--are familiar to me. But just because I'm not the intended audience doesn't make this book any less important. Oh, and while I'm here, I totally think this book needs to be released in mass market paperback. Remember those? I used to load up on them in middle school and high school, but I rarely see kids' and YA books in that format these days. But if there's a book that needs to be small and unobtrusive, it's All Boys Aren't Blue. Let's make it easier for kids who need and want to read it to pass this book around in spite of bans!Show more"

The author discusses his growth from a “young, effeminate boy” into a man who is comfortable with his identity. I can see why this book is important- many kids don’t have a memoir that they can see themselves in, and this book helps fix that disparity. I read this book in my quest to read more frequently banned and challenged books, and I am so glad I did. Books like this are an amazing way to gain empathy and understanding.Show more"

It also brought a Black story to main stream audiences that is not just centered around THE STRUGGLE. A quick, (mostly) painless, thought provoking read. 💙Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1615507-karen,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 5 out of 5,"July 19, 2023",2 likes,0,"My school district has this book in one of our five high schools and of course it has been challenged. (It was approved to remain so then the ultra conservative school board completely changed the book policy because they still want to remove this book!) So I decided to read it so I could understand why they wanted to remove it (and be ready with evidence for why it should remain). And, as I expected, the two small scenes that these conservatives have labeled as ""pornography"" are absolutely not that. Instead, this is a book about a young black man who is trying to figure out his sexuality and how to navigate both his black world and the queer world. And even though he was in an accepting family, he still didn't feel like he could come out and be his full queer self.He also got himself into some situations that he didn't know how to handle or how to deal with both during and afterwards because he had no one he could ask and no examples (in books or movies) of someone going through a similar situation. So this book is meant to perhaps help others navigate similar situations so they don't have to make the same mistakes he did. And that is why this book is so important to have available to high school students. Having this example of the struggles George faced could truly help someone else struggling. So although there are two scenes that are of a sexual nature, it's quite ""tame"" (definitely not spicy!) and there are specific reasons for those scenes to be there. I've highlighted quite a few passages that were extremely powerful. I know it's not going to change the minds of those who want to ban this book, but for those on the fence in my community, I'm hoping they will look at the bigger picture of this book and see how important it is.Show more"

I enjoyed the book in its audio format which is read by the author - in this case, it added to the story. Johnson's recollections and letters do a powerful job of explaining the complexity of intersectionality as he is both Black and queer. I understand why the book is being questioned for age appropriateness - Johnson's personal timeline extends into college which may feel beyond the scope of a high school student, but also sexual encounters are being discussed in detail with plain and straightforward language. It isn't the kind of content I would like to read or discuss with my mom, but for someone struggling with their sexuality and what that really looks like, this book could be life-changing. He notes on several occasions that these things are embarrassing. I appreciated Johnson's candor. It is a vulnerable telling and one I am glad he was willing to share.

I'm proud of the author for writing so openly about their own life and experiences.Being a memoir about being a Black queer child and growing up in an environment that makes people feel uncomfortable with who we all are, this book is not always comfortable to read. There is assault, grooming, prejudice against race and sexuality. On the flip side, there is also so much love and understanding in a family scenario, good friendships and parental role-models.As a memoir suggested for young-adults, it's such an important asset to bring to life discussions around gender and sexuality identification, how to protect oneself and others from molestation, and how to become your own person in a world that constantly tries to make us fit certain parameters.

This book is unlike anything I’ve read before, and to the author’s point, if I had had something like this when I was younger, maybe it would have helped me to understand my relationship to sexuality and gender sooner. It is a graphic retelling. There are explicit descriptions of violence, death, debilitating illness, sex, and molestation of a minor. While these are handled matter-of-factly and with great care, I think that trigger warnings at the beginning might be appropriate and helpful for some readers. These are obviously the reasons that the book has been challenged and banned in some places. While I do not approve of either, I do think that authors owe readers agency so that they can choose whether it’s safe for them to open a book or not.At the same time, there is so much love expressed by the author for his family, especially his dad, mom, cousins and grandmother, Nanny. His family’s acceptance and encouragement of him, his trans cousin, and other queer family and friends was uplifting. The letters the author writes to his cousin Hope, his brother, and his mom were lovely. There were a lot of descriptions and details that I found myself skimming over, and sometimes I felt like the summaries at the end of the chapters were overwrought to try and provide the LGBTQ+ “moral” at the end. However, several of these did stick with me: 1) how schools and teachers fail students of every color by not teaching enough about BIPOC (and without mentioning it LGBTQ+) history; 2) how deplorable our sex education is, and how it puts LGBTQ+ folx at a disadvantage (among other things) because it puts sex in the context of procreation instead of pleasure; 3) self education is the greatest weapon against those on a mission to subvert you; and 4) if you’re not willing for fight for yourself, then who else should do it for you? I feel that this is an important book that is worth reading. It elevates and normalizes the thoughts and experiences of LGBTQ+ folx, especially youth, although it is only from one queer person’s perspective.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

Hearing the voice of a person like you, seeing them live their life and truth, can truly inspire and encourage. For LGBTQ+ youth, this representation is paramount. When I was a young man coming to terms with my own sexuality, seeing other gay men represented in the media provided a beacon of hope that everything would be okay. Fortunately for me, I was growing up at a time where being a gay man was beginning to lose some of the stigmas that had plagued it before. But imagine for a moment that I'd never had this representation. For countless queer black men like author George M. Johnson, representation has been non-existent. In his book All Boys Aren't Blue, Johnson sets out to rectify that. For as long as he could remember, George felt different. He grew up surrounded by his large extended family. There was no shortage of cousins to play with and learn from. Still, George didn't quite see himself in any of his family members. It began at recess where each of the kids separated out into their prescribed groups. The boys all would play ball, but George had little interest. Instead, he would climb to the hill with a group of girls to jump rope. These were his friends, and this is what he liked to do. This was also the first time George began to question himself. The other couldn't understand why he wouldn't want to play with them. George was beginning to wonder too. All Boys Aren't Blue is a manifesto of sorts. George M. Johnson sets out to provide a history of his own story and guide others into accepting themselves. From his early days of recognizing himself as ""other"" to growing into a man much more confident in his sexuality, Johnson writes each anecdote with an honesty that serves to inspire and educate. His perspective from the intersection of both the queer and black communities helps to give a different insight into each of them. The book is geared toward a teenage audience, and I think it is really successful in answering some of the common questions about relationships, sex, and being a queer/black person. I could also see this being a helpful tool for parents who are trying to navigate their children's identity. All Boys Aren't Blue serves as a moving portrait of one man's life and a brilliant example of more diverse representation in books. Show more"

I knew right away that I wanted to read this book when I heard of it because 1) we need more Black queer non-fiction always and forever, and 2) I KNEW IMMEDIATELY that the title was in reference to Moonlight aka my favorite movie of all time, and I had to get my hands on this ASAP. There were definitely powerful messages that I got out of this memoir that I knew I would get: loving yourself, knowing yourself, holding yourself to a higher standard, and in general, accepting yourself and constantly changing who you are as a person and how you present yourself. I found so many great messages about queerness and what it's like being Black in America and being both at the same time and how those different identities fit together. There were many great messages about finding people in this life that love you just as you are, even when you can't fully love yourself as you are quite yet. There was also such a great discussion of trauma and what it does to us to hold onto it and bury it where no one else but you will ever be able to find it. That many of us take our trauma ""to the grave"" and it stays with us without reprieve. It really made me think of all of the trauma that I have been carrying with me for years and years without letting it surface, and how my life might change if I let it air out for a while. One of the best aspects of this book was hearing about George's family and friends, who were all in the majority of loving and accepting him for who he is, and learning along with him how to support who he is. It is so fucking rare to see a depiction of a family who is so wholesome and loving of a queer member of the family, and it filled me with so much love to see how supported and cared for he always was and always will be. It gives me hope that someday my family will be accepting of my queer identity and be willing to grow and learn along with me.The theme in this book that I never saw coming and definitely struck a chord with me was the topic of your name and your associated identity with that name. I go by a nickname, and have been going by it for quite a few years now due to the origin of my real name. And in a humanities class in college, I divulged to my professor in an essay on self-identity that my real name is Jordynn, and I had felt out of sorts using it for these past few years, and Jo seemed like a good fit to start over with (in college, because where else do you start anew?). He said that he liked my nickname, that I fit it, but he also liked my real name because of the origins of the name itself: Jordan, a river where many people--including Jesus--flocked to to baptize themselves and essentially begin anew. He pointed out that the act of going from Jordynn to Jo was an act of washing myself clean of a name with Biblical origins, and it has sat with me ever since. And George's sections in this book reflecting on his name were very powerful and hit me much like my Professor's wisdom did. So, all in all, this memoir was absolutely fantastic and was the perfect read for Pride month and for all of the events that are currently taking place with BLM and amplifying Black voices. I hope George M. Johnson continues to publish books because I love the way he picks apart hard topics and puts them back together.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5033960-hulttio,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 3 out of 5,"January 8, 2021",2 likes,0,"This was a compelling and enjoyable memoir of Johnson’s life so far. From his early childhood happiness and traumas to his growth and coming-into-being as an adult, he shares with the reader deeply personal and intimate moments. It feels like skipping the awkward, small-talk phase of a friendship and having those hours-long 3 AM conversations with a close friend about your lives. While I enjoyed and am grateful to have shared in Johnson’s life and his story, the memoir does read like a debut work and is probably more enjoyable to its target audience.Many of the themes in the book resonated with my own experience, and I laughed and (figuratively) cried with Johnson as he takes us through everything, not sparing the reader any words. The themes of repression, loss, trauma, self-acceptance, and others are very much relevant not only to Johnson’s intended audience of young, queer, Black readers but also to people who fit none of those labels. Because of that, I suppose most people would find some point of commonality in this memoir, though perhaps those who share some or all of Johnson’s identities would find it more meaningful. I do, and found it both relatable but also a bit frustrating. While the memoir is deeply personal, it also feels quite raw in the emotions and relationships that Johnson portrays. He loves his Nanny and mother, and both are pivotal to his life; though I was glad that he had positive and supportive figures in his life, I also felt empty at how much my family is the exact opposite. I’m not sure if this aspect of the book will feel as hopeful to some young readers, especially those dealing with painful familial struggles. It was tough to read the interludes of personal letters to various family members, since he was fortunate to be surrounded by loving and supportive family. It felt like a sharp contrast to my own experience, and Johnson doesn't really give much time talking about this potential disconnect readers may feel.The manifesto element of the book was also a bit unclear. Johnson tells us snippets and moments from his life in a mostly chronological manner, and then analyzes them and spells out some profound statements at the end. The statements themselves may be worthwhile, but this method became repetitive and felt vague at times. As one other reviewer put it, there is too much telling and not enough showing; Johnson could trust his audience to infer some of the conclusions he explains to the reader. Reading a book is not one-sided. The reader is free, and indeed often, imparts their own meanings and inferences to the story (whether fictional or not), and this may or may not align with the author. I certainly disagreed with some of Johnson's statements, but this is reflective of the fact that no community or minority is a monolith that will always agree.This is a significant and important work, and I applaud Johnson for writing this. It took a lot of effort, bravery, and introspection to publish a book that details not only your heroic family members but also your most personal traumas and embarrassing experiences.It has been a week of the new year, and this is my third book read so far. The pandemic and lockdown might have disrupted my reading rhythm last year, but I have a good feeling about getting back into the swing of it now, even though it feels like it is still March 2020. Or maybe I tend to be really into reading more books in the beginning months of the year… we’ll see.“The boy who had struggled to find friends for so long finally had a whole group of people he could call his brothers.”Show more"

This is a story for us all.''All Boys Aren't Blue is the first memoir I've ever read. I've always been very skeptical about non-fiction books, I was very much sure that I would get bored at some point in the book. I believe that writing non-fiction books and making them actually interesting is a very hard job. That's why I'm really happy that my first choice for non-fiction was All Boys Aren't Blue because they achieved that excellence. George Matthew Johnson definitely has a distinct and addictive way of telling stories. There wasn't even a tiny second that I was bored. From the very start to the finish, the story kept getting gradually more and more interesting. After learning Johnson narrates the book, I decided to listen to the audiobook version. It was an amazing journey, hearing the story from John's own voice and listening to them talk about their experiences. Johnson offers a real honest look into what it means to be black AND queer by talking about gender, sexuality, and race. I think most of the time having intersections is one of the most difficult things that you can experience because it makes you scared and the feeling of not fitting in is more present than ever. In Johnson's case, a white person looks at them and sees a black person, while a black person looks at them and sees someone who is queer. Throughout the book, they talk about their memories and experiences with that intersection, and reading this book was an eye-opening experience for me.The book also contains letters from Johnson to some of their family members. For me, the best part of All Boys Aren't Blue was those letters. I cried every time a letter came along, they were very heart-felt and they made me feel so many things at once. And I'm stressing this again but hearing the letters by Johnson's voice made the experience ten times better than it already was. The letters and the memories Johnson shares about their family opens a window for us to see their family dynamic and also to black culture. I personally don't live in a place where I can meet Black people so I don't know a whole bunch about Black culture but and after reading this book I realized many similarities between Turkish culture and Black culture.''You sometimes don't know you exist until you realize someone like you existed before.''This quote right here is one of the most important reasons why books like these should exist. Many people who are considered minorities don't get to see themselves represented anywhere while growing up and maybe even later in life. Queer black people have always been on the frontlines of the struggles and battles LGBTIAPQ+ people had to fight. But even today, especially with everything that's been going on around the world and with the increasing racism, they don't get enough credit. I respect George Matthew Johnson for writing a book that is so selfless and vulnerable and open and honest for all the boys out there who aren't blue and for all the black queer kids, black queer people who need this story. Keep on trying and keep on working hard to give Black people, Black queer people, and the people who are considered minorities the representation and the platform they deserve. Last but not least, ''Being queer is a journey. One that is ever-changing as identities that were once in the dark come to light.''Show more"

I feel bad for saying that, but I'm not sure how else to put it. All Boys Aren't Blue is just extremely bland. The style is... it either feels like George M. Johnson is reciting a high school graduation speech or he's about to pitch his LLC to you.Like, you should never finish a memoir and still have no idea who the subject is. And I feel no closer to knowing Johnson now than when I started this book. He presents his memories without examining or reflecting on them aside from espousing generalities of moving toward racial, gender and sexual equality. Which is nice, but I would like something a little more thoughtful than what I could find browsing social justice twitter. Like, what is it about his names that made him switch from Matthew to George? I know it happened because he said it happened, and he explains why people generally change their names, but he doesn't explain why for himself. Then there's one section in which he says he wanted to write down his experiences so others wouldn't have to go through the same, but does nothing to explain the circumstances of those experiences or how others might avoid the same. At one point he says he majored in finance as an undergrad. Why? I don't know. He never delves into his career goals, his aspirations, anything. I have no idea what Johnson likes or wants.He talks a lot about being perceived as being a sissy as a kid, but never goes into descriptions of what that is or means to him exactly. There aren't a lot of ""how""s in general. He also equivocates on this point by stressing how into sports he is, with (I think) the agenda being to muddy expectations of queer people but also it felt like he wanted to insist on having SOME masculine bona fides.There's another section where Johnson talks about his cousin Hope, who was a trans woman. He uses her birth name extensively, there's some nice passages about having an imperfect familial support system, and while I'm pretty sure Hope would be okay with Johnson using her old name, he never qualifies whether or not it's okay to use someone's birth name without their permission. Which feels... needed.The blandness, ultimately, comes from a refusal to really dig into any of its themes. Johnson claims the book has themes of gender, sexuality and critical race theory but never engages with them beyond a surface level. I don't need a dissertation on Judith Butler or bell hooks but give me SOMETHING that suggests you have an understanding of what you're talking about. He chronicles certain events in his life that intersect with gender, sexuality and race but doesn't discuss how and why they intersect. Like he has the plot section down on his wiki but cuts himself short before the analysis part. This could either come from Johnson himself, his own apprehension with getting too personal (which seems wild for someone writing a memoir) or it could come from editorial intrusion. It's marketed as YA, which is infamously rigid in what it allows. I don't know. But the effect is the same. While there were a lot of nice sentiments in this book it didn't leave me with much to think about, and there are better YA works out there to introduce teens to information on race, queer and sexuality.Show more"

I could only imagine the courage it took for you to be yourself."" Here's a link to my youtube video review: https://youtu.be/Ae1RNWw2mIUAs Johnson described his life story it felt as if he was simply engaging in an open and honest conversation with me. Many memoirs, especially those describing the experiences of marginalized folx, do a lot of teaching while telling their story, but this doesn't do that. Well it does, but nothing about Johnson's writing felt forced or heavily didactic. The stories within this memoir were intentionally reflective in such a way that Johnson brought the reader to the same realizations he himself came to.  Things I loved about the book:- How Johnson described his relationship with his family. There's a chapter about his brother, which made me reflect on my relationship with my siblings and brought me to tears. Also, the relationship between him and his grandma was so beautiful it brought out happy tears for me lol!- All the stories were so sooo relatable to my own experience as a black queer trans person! Specifically, the chapter ""Prom Kings we Never Were"", which discusses closeted-ness was just so spot on.  Things I felt neutral about:- I felt slightly apathetic as Johnson explained the impact his fraternity had on him. I understand being a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity played a huge role in shaping his masculinity and understanding of gender, but that chapter seemed long. Things I wish Johnson would've discussed more:- I definitely expected him to talk more about his father being a cop, but maybe that will come in his future books.- I also would love to hear more of his life stories that didn't make the final draft for the book, because I bet they're relatable as well.Overall, reading All Boys Aren't Blue was an amazing experience. It's definitely one of my top reads for this year.  CW: sexual trauma, homophobia, racism, grief Show more"

I loved everything Johnson said and the way he flipped the notion of “coming out” to “inviting in.” I immediately knew I had to read his memoir-manifesto. I’ll start out by saying that this book wasn’t written for me, but for Black LGBT+ teens. But his message is important for everyone to understand. It’s extremely hard to be a black boy in America. It’s even harder when you are queer. Johnson shares intimate and very personal details about his young life that has shaped him into who he is today. It was refreshing to read a memoir about a supportive family and I particularly liked reading about his Nanny. It makes me wish I could have grown up around extended family, grandparents, aunts, and cousins because the experience sounds so loving. The social justice aspects of the book tended to be better written and more engaging but the stories were also a nice compliment. Many times while reading this book, my heart was full of joy to read someone speak their truth and universal truths that Black and queer people experience everyday.Oh, and guess what? I learned from the acknowledgments that Eric Smith is Johnson’s agent! Of course he is. Eric is the best.I really enjoyed this memoir and can’t wait to read more from Johnson! So happy to see more diverse YA books being published!Show more"

It is so necessary and I'm so glad that those for whom it was written have this book in their lives to help them live.Johnson writes beautifully about growing up at the intersection of Black and queer, how he recognized his differences early on, how he explored them over time, and how he came to truly know himself. (BTW, as far as I have seen, Johnson identifies as non-binary but uses he/him pronouns. If I am incorrect on any of that, please do let me know.) Even though as a white queer cis woman, he and I have had very different lives and experiences, that element of looking back and seeing how early on your queerness was showing up was so familiar and honestly a joy to read. And I loved learning about his family, and seeing this lovely example of upending the false stereotype that Black families are less accepting of queerness. Obviously, exclusion and ostracizing and violence happens to queer folks, including Black queer folks, in many homes, but it's always been frustrating that so many people (mostly white people) just believe as fact that Black people are more homophobic. Johnson's family was a wonderful example to the contrary.Because this is a YA memoir, it is written in a very straightforward casual style, but I really appreciated that and think it made the book even better than your typical memoir that strives to sound more like literary fiction. Reading this felt like a friend telling you about their life, and thus it felt more intimate and immediate. And because this book is aimed mostly at young queer Black kids, it makes sense for it to be written in a way that will appeal to them and draw them in. And I truly hope that reading it will help some of them know themselves better, and love themselves more.I truly enjoyed reading this and getting to know the author, and watching him discover himself, find his place in the world, and smash gender stereotypes to pieces while doing so. It's bold and brave and queer, to quote the author himself. Absolutely loved it and want to put it in the hands of every kid who could benefit from reading it...as well as many adults. A definite rare 5-star read for me.Show more"

This is a story for us all.”I don’t think I will ever be able to express just how I feel about this book. George M Johnson’s memoir is written with one person in mind; the reader. Telling the story of what it is like to grow up both queer and black; never quite fitting into society either because of your sexuality or the colour of your skin. I expected a read full of tragedies, heartbreak and deep hurt. How wrong was I! George writes from a place full of love, understanding, forgiveness and down right acceptance. This is a story with one goal in mind; to tell every queer black person that it is ok to be themselves, to own their truth and fully accept who they are. George writes with such confidence that will definitely make any reader feel like they are in safe hands. And for those that need to; this book will make them stand up, take note and LISTEN.For me, what stands out the most is the sense of familial love and acceptance. It is so refreshing and beautiful to read a story about a family like George’s. From old time values like Nanny who also has the ability to accept each and every one of her children and grandchildren for exactly who they are. I know that, even nowadays this is not how it is for everyone. But to know that there will be someone out there who will support and love you is so important for young readers everywhere; especially when they are not getting that support at home. The message to these people is simple: you are not the problem! And even though Nanny may never win no awards; she has definitely gained fans in abundance!This is so much more than a memoir. This is an open letter to every queer black person out there that you can be you; and be proud of you. That there are others out there, your community. There is another message here though. A message of family. A message of love and tolerance. Every queer person the world over should experience these words. They will stay with you forever. And to George. Keep being you.Show more"

After reading some reviews, seeing white people police a Black queer man on what it means to be queer and how to tell his story, I am fuming. It was not written for you. It was not written for you to gatekeep. You can not so kindly take that shit somewhere else. (Yes, that includes you white queers as well). Now, let’s talk about this gem of a book. Oh how I wish I could give this to all my queer BIPOC friends in their youths. What a game changer it would’ve been so obviously it’ll be a game changer now. There are so many direct quotes I wanted to share from this book but it would literally just be me quoting the entire thing. Some of it just hit home so hard. And it’s incredibly hard to explain exactly why. I think what George does so beautifully is tackle the intersectionality of his existence and that of others. At one point in the book (Chapter 13), he says this: “It’s one thing to deal with just Black kids and worry about sexual identity. It’s entirely different to struggle with white kids because I was Black, and Black kids because I was gay. That double marginalization was a tiresome burden.” When I tell you that just hit me in the stomach... damn. So often when talking about existing as a queer person and as a BIPOC, they come very much with their own battles, but often those battles overlap. And then you are fighting two battles at once and it is exhausting. And then you have people gatekeeping, gaslighting, or just out right ignorant to your experience and your existence and it’s another level. Every bit of how we see the world is colored by being BIPOC, by being queer, by our gender identity, and so on. The exhaustion that comes with that is one that I often wonder if we’ll ever shake. As a BIPOC queer, it felt like I was building a new home in a new friend. I hope to meet George one day. To thank him for telling his story. To let him know that I am one he reached. For my Black queer folx, I see you. I love you. You are, easily, the coolest people I know and you inspire me every day. Show more"

They sought to use sports and later fraternity membership as a shield to exist without feeling otherized. 2)Johnson explains how some queer people experience second adolescence as adults because society does not create a place for teens' exploration or conversations on sexuality and gender identity. They conflated sexuality and gender identity, which are separate, but Johnson lacked the language and information. This knowledge is usually only gained at the university level.3) They detail the Black erasure from American History that occurs in schools. In elementary, they learned a sanitized version of history that doesn't comport with reality and focuses on the same Black historical figures without nuance. Johnson highlights the ""school-to-prison pipeline"" in which educators view Black students as problems rather than potentials when they question or challenge teachers - behavior encouraged in their white peers. They shared a story about a white teacher claiming he would have ""owned slaves."" 4) The highlight of the book is their Nanny (grandmother). The relationship they shared with Nanny is my favorite aspect of the book! Nanny recognized Johnson's queerness and showered them with love. Their bond touched my heart.

George M. Johnson opens the book stating all the reasons why you may not like it— that it can be graphic and trigger warnings. Which is brilliant — especially for a YA memoir. The memoir goes through his life starting when he was a child - traumas he experienced as well as him coming to terms with his identity. This book is well written, funny at times and you cannot help but love his family. There is a chapter where he was molested by a cousin and describing gay sex — mistakes he made doing harm to his body because he wasn’t educated on gay sex. He even states in the book that it was embarrassing but he would rather be embarrassed than not share the information with people who needed it. George M. Johnson wrote the book he needed when he was a teen and I am confident in saying that this book is helping so many feel validated. As for this book being challenged — how many times can I say yes the descriptions in the book may make you uncomfortable but they are oh so important for teens to be exposed to information and the feeling of being uncomfortable — please don’t prevent this from being in the school library for kid that needs it….

George Johnson covers so many important topics through the telling of his story. He walks us through his family, his most important personal experiences, personal traumas and more importantly his resilience and perseverance to make his own way and forge his own identity. His voice is empowering and encouraging and I truly believe this book will save lives. He is honest and transparent in sharing his struggles with the intersectionalism of blackness and queerness. He challenges gender norms, traditional sex education, sexuality, blackness, queerness, family, unconditional love and forgiveness. He refers to his work as a manifesto and with today's cultural and political climate I can see why. He is bold and intentional with his words yet offers hope at the same time. This is one book that needs to be required reading by every educator and parent to gain understanding of today's youth that may be feeling unwanted, unloved and discarded by society for simply trying to be who they are. I cried so many tears for George yet at the same time smiled and cheered every small victory and step he took in creating his own identity. If you only read one YA book all year, I recommend this one. You will be completely transformed after being informed which is so important.

I think that speaks immeasurably to johnson’s talent and aptitude for storytelling, something he carries throughout every chapter in the memoir. he reminds us that no matter what, hope and love are possible despite every type of adversity.tw: homophobia, transphobia, racism, slurs, violence, mentions of HIV/AIDS, sexual assault.

Do I think it’s worth reading- absolutely, especially for older teens and YA who may be struggling with their sexual identity. However, some of the things the author writes just left me scratching my head. At 33 when he writes this memoir, he insinuates that he coined the term “honey-child” or “honey-chile” as someone a decade older and having heard my elders speaking that particular vernacular I can say, no sir!!  “Before shade was actually a thing”- ummm Shade was always a thing. He wrote about engaging in one liners with his girl pack and “ I was Reading folks before it became a catchy phrase “ - what??? he makes it seem as if he created most of the cultural phenomenons we know today and that takes away from his message. Masculinity: he talks ad nauseum about his masculinity or hyper masculinity, yet only once or twice does he take the time to remind the reader to be themselves, love themselves for who they are and not what society expects them to be on the daily. At the end he gives kudos to his family being queer affirming: except he didn’t delve into it at all, if this is a book to help others, it would be nice to know HOW his family affirmed him, how they helped him, HOW their unconditional love of him was crucial to the process, anything that would be helpful to a youth looking to possibly come out to their own family. Saying it without showing how, just is NOT helpful. The book does have its good points, him finally letting go of the need to deny his queerness and be himself on his own terms, he did talk, albeit very, very, briefly about the lack of mental health care to deal with trauma in the black community and I wish he had delved more into that because it is such an important topic that needs to be discussed and spotlighted more.

All Boys Aren't Blue is Johnson's ""memoir-manifesto"" where they chronicle their early life and relationships as well as experiences with racism and homophobia. As always with memoirs, I would like to hold space for the bravery that it takes to publicly commune with your past self and they definitely lay it out in a raw and personal way. That being said, I think to call it a manifesto, even in part, is a misnomer as so much of my problem is how little new it offers aside from Johnson's life. There are interesting reflections in it, but most of the political is definitions of things like microaggressions, outing, coming out, etc. that made me wonder whether this book was meant for people who are younger because invariably older people would have heard of these terms. That being said, very little in it, asides from its surface levelness, suggests it is for teens and young adults which is probably one of its biggest internal conflicts.Another one of these big internal conflicts is the occasional disconnect between the event Johnson is describing and their explanations of the symbolism of these events which sometimes they tend to overexplain and possibly exaggerate.The book's biggest strength is thematically in dealing with so many important topics. However, most queer people who grew up in the generation that Johnson is probably targeting, having access to the internet and all, have likely heard better explained versions of all the takeaways from the book.I really don't know who specifically I would recommend the book to but it was an engaging read that I really do hope helps someone to see their self.Show more"

Johnson tells the story of his life growing up queer and black in New Jersey. Johnson tackles a host of issues ranging from racial discrimination, prejudice against effeminate children and teens, AIDS, education, internal conflicts over sexual identity and so much more. Johnson wrote this book as a YA memoir that he wished he had growing up. I do think in a lot of ways Johnson was extremely fortunate. He is part of a loving family that supported him and gave him the freedom to be who he wanted to be and gave him the resources he needed to thrive. His natural athletic talent also helped him blend into the schoolyard social structure and expectations for male behavior. I also suspect that Johnson was a smart, go getter with a charismatic personality and leadership tendencies that probably served him well. I think it is very telling that with all this going for him it still took him until he was in his 20s before he felt comfortable enough in his own skin to come out to his family. And for me this is where this book shines. Johnson does an excellent job illustrating this internal turmoil between being true to himself while conforming to societal exceptions. Does he double dutch jump rope with the girls or play football with the boys? How do you respond to the direct question of ""Are you gay?"" while you are still struggling internally with that question.The audiobook, which is narrated by the author, is phenomenal.

George M.

He shares hard truths like, “my life story is proof that no amount of money, love, or support can protect you from a society intent on killing you for your Blackness.” He also shares family love. Much of this book seemed to be a love letter to his grandmother – Nanny. He shares traumas and the complicated messiness of life. You’ll even bump into a few brief history lessons that show how the telling of history can be so very different depending on who is telling it and what they think of the students they’re telling it to. There’s so much here to appreciate. And yes, because there is some heavy stuff here, the delivery can be pretty serious, but Johnson’s playfulness and sense of humor also rings out here and there.Recommendation: Get it now. There are painful moments in this book for sure, but there is also joy and much love. This book is an act of bravery and helps readers see one experience of being queer and Black right now.

This year, I thought I'd start observing an alternative qualtagh: the first book I encountered in 2021. George M. Johnson’s All Boys Aren’t Blue is a memoir geared toward youth and young adults, and it’s the sort of book that I wish existed when I was a teenager. I appreciated how clearly and personally Johnson makes the case for the need for queer sex education, how lovingly they describe their queer-affirming Black family and Black fraternity, and how candidly and compassionately they write about the trauma of sexual abuse. The book is also full of examples that represent gender-nonconforming ways of being.

Which this felt like in the first few sentences. It starts off literally saying “I am using these words, but you are not allowed to use them” which to me is just ridiculous. But I am from Norway, which I believe to be very different from the America that the author is from. Having just read a “first and only” story that felt like a communal piece for others in the same boat, this immediately felt like shutting people out, like the author feels superior in experiencing discrimination and pain. I don’t like it when books tell me how to feel. I was never angry about giving birth and the midwife telling me I had a healthy baby girl - to where the author of the books says “assigning their gender is a conditioning placed upon us.” Instead the author suggests we simply say the child was born with female genitalia. I kid you not. Who speaks like this?I am neither left nor right, I am in the middle. And the polarization in America feels very extremist to me. You’re too quickly labeled, and you’re either with or against. This book is veeeery far left and feels angry about everyone else. And I don’t feel that it’s the best way to go about wanting others to hear your truth. And honestly, if you want things to be your way, why are you gatekeeping language and culture by starting off with saying that others are not allowed to speak these words?

I encourage you all to read and support this book because it teaches you many things about racism, family, friendship, queerness, and the importance of self-love.After reading and process all about this book, I conclude that our society needs a SERIOUS REVINDICATION and a new focus because we can't be living the same way we are right now.

Described by the author as a ""memoir-manifesto"" and geared towards young adults, I can't get over the feeling that this is an incredibly important book. It is written as a collection of essays, describing key moments in the author's life growing up queer and black. This is so unflinchingly honest. Johnson covers so much from experiencing racism to toxic masculinity to sexuality and sexual experiences to consent and more. He is incredibly frank about the traumas he has gone through and while those are very heavy topics, he also infused this whole work with the blanket of love he received from his family. He didn't shy away from describing his joyful moments as well as the traumas. I think it was so important for him to have included the celebrations and let the Black joy shine through. I also really appreciated that he set a tone very much of a mentor or friend. I think that queer black young adults who read this in the future and perhaps did not have the family structure and support George had will benefit from that tone.

I am not usually a non-fiction reader but this memoir is so powerful and I felt so moved by the author’s bravery in sharing their journey and story. All Boys Aren’t Blue is the author’s journey of being Black and being queer. The book touches on identity (gender and sexual), prejudices, racism, struggles, complicated family relationships, assault, friendships, activism, and hope. I listened to this on audio and definitely recommend, it’s narrated by the author and just added another layer to the story.This is a book that I absolutely loved but I won’t keep on my shelves because I want it to reach others who need to read it. The author talks about in the book how he never had resources and stories of people who felt the same/dealt with similar issues he had growing up. And how sharing his story and journey will hopefully help others/reach others. There was the conversation of how sex education, in the U.S. for this book, is only directed towards a male & female and how the lack of any other type of sexual relationship is not discussed and how that can be extremely harmful & dangerous for someone participating in a mm relationship for example. How can you know what to prepare for, what dangers/risks to be aware of if it is not talked about and taught. Sex education in general is just a mess and discussions about gender identity and/or sexual identity is sorely lacking in education formats. So I think when a powerful book comes along that is opening up the conversation and can possibly help/heal/mean something, you just want to get it into the hands of others. Show more"

I appreciate learning more of the author in a special zoom discussion session.I personally raised an eyebrow on the author’s final words of chapter 2. “Let yourself unlearn everything you thought you knew about yourself, and listen to what you need to know about those who navigate life outside the margins of a heterosexual box. I bet most of you never thought to ever question if you even like you name. Or question if that was something you had the power to change if you didn’t. I hope you will now . . . “As a white, almost 52 year old who, like George Johnson, loved to jump rope in a NJ elementary school, I also totally thought to question whether I like my name from a young age. I even did a class project with a crest where I proudly wrote my name of the day, “Joe”, partly inspired by Little Women and partly inspired by wanting to join the boys’ (there was no girls’) wrestling team.Sometimes I felt a distinct us v them vibe in George Matt Johnson’s words. I understand that they feel like they come from a marginalized space, so I understand the stance. I just wish our literature could focus on bridging rather than amplifying divides. We are all more alike than not, regardless of race or sexuality. The tapestry of humanity is richer when we recognize the individual fibers as part of a bigger beautiful picture.Show more"

This is another book that I picked up in order to spread my viewpoint and horizons and try to understand people who are different than me. This is a memoir written by a queer black man and this book tells of his experiences in being in both minority groups. He talks a lot about racism and homophobia and the struggles that he has gone through growing up. Very eye opening and it really showed how we should treat others the same way we would want to be treated and to not judge based on someone’s sexuality and skin color. In addition to not agreeing with all his points, this book got only 4 stars for a few more reasons. I feel like one of his underlying points was that people in the LGBTQIA+ and black community should not be marginalized or put in a box. However in doing so, I think he also stereotyped against white and straight people - I don’t know if this was intentional or not but I felt like it was counterintuitive to his whole point. Also, I think in some of his points, he seemed very anti-white which kind of bugged me because I believe there is a way to lift up black people without hating white people. Either way, great book!

When adults police what is “appropriate” for students, they often decide based on what they are comfortable dealing with, not based on kids' needs. Every theme explored in this book: race, gender, sex, sexuality, community, family, friendship, trauma, forgiveness and more are all part of a kid’s life. They should be discussed. Most importantly, kids (and their parents) should read about George’s family. Growing up, I always made excuses for the adults: the teachers, parents, relatives, and neighbours around me for their transphobia. It felt justified by the Law, the media, the culture, “the times.” I sympathised with the fact that they were unaware, that they couldn’t understand, couldn’t possibly know how small and alone they made me feel. Had I read about George’s family, I wouldn’t have made so many excuses for them and blamed myself for so much. If not in real life, at least through this book, kids may get a glimpse of a family that priortises empathy and kindness over their own selfish desire for conformity. I have reservations with what I perceive is a lack of perspective in certain chapters (particularly those dealing with gender & masculinity), but I think a curious, critical engagement with this book would be invaluable for so many kids.Show more"

Johnson's memoir of growing up as a queer Black man is a potent rendering of the traumas and triumphs he's faced in his life. This book was not written for me, so it did not resonate in the same way as it might a young queer person of color. But I think Johnson's aim in writing a text that was both a manifesto and a memoir was well-realized and well-executed. Teens I think will appreciate Johnson's frankness in the telling of his experiences, in his refusal to shy away from the fact that young people experience trauma, and therefore need to see it represented in literature. The writing does not dramatize, romanticize, or sugarcoat any of his experiences with sexual assault, death, or the loss of virginity. I appreciated that he made sure to include his reasoning for this in the foreward. This book fills an important gap in the memoir-nonfiction world, and I hope that this book becomes readily available to queer teens, especially queer teens of color. (I think perhaps my rating stems from listening to the audio rather than reading the book - I didn't love Johnson's performance, and I think I might have been able to feel more deeply connected without focusing on the ways in which I wasn't enjoying that.)Show more"

Johnson, which details his experiences growing up as a queer POC. There’s a lot of really great takeaway from Johnson’s novel, especially in regards to how (POC) members of the LGBTQIA+ community are treated. I especially liked that Johnson showcases how the things we experience during adolescence can really shape the adults we become, and I find it so heartbreaking how many negative experiences he’s gone through and how they affected him throughout his life. Ultimately though, I felt I wasn’t quite in the right age range for this title, as I felt it read a bit young (explicit scenes aside). I also think I would have enjoyed this more had it been more cohesive. I think the step from a collection of essays into a narrative isn’t such a large one in this case and perhaps would have made Johnson’s journey even more impactful.

I hope many queer youth will find a safe space within its pages.Two things that stick out to me. First, this is an incredibly raw and honest book. Johnson does not hide the ugly truths they’ve experienced as a young Black and queer youth. They talk candidly about their early experiences with sex, both negative and positive. The way negative events shaped their perception of physical intimacy and sex. They also discusses the need for healthy sex education for queer teens who often are left to figure things out on their own to potentially dangerous consequences. Second, this is truly written with teens in mind. It reads like a conversation between Johnson and the reader. It felt like listening to an older sibling sharing their story.

One (of many differences because no one story is a carbon copy of another) is that the former works are adult and All Boys Aren’t Blue is VERY clearly YA. By that I mean, some of the concepts are pretty elementary (ex. explaining sex Ed. concepts and the history of the Jim Crow south). It also was a little more heavy-handed in its lessons/affirmations than I expected. Nothing here really blew me away. I didn’t find the prose particularly striking or find any humor here.

One of the better auto-biographies that I've read in recent years. While it was far from perfect, and Johnson bordered on mildly narcissistic at points, there were a lot of good bits of advice to take away from this book. Whether you're black or white, gay or straight or bi, young or old, I guarantee you'll find at least one or two chapters that resonate with you. My only major complaint about this was the lack of struggle regarding his support system. I couldn't help but think—all through the book—what George Johnson's life had been like if his family hadn't been as supportive and open-minded as it was. How many kids out there are ostracized by their own parents, their own siblings, because of who and what they are? How different would the advice in this book be—how much harder would Johnson's words hit—if he had actually had to struggle without the backbone of a family surrounding him? Other than that, this is a story I recommend to many fans of non-fiction who need more LGBTQ+ on their shelves.

Don't be a creep and make it sexually explicit.I don't understand the motivation behind publishing a memoir as YA to begin with. The point of a memoir is that it's reflecting on childhood experiences as an adult. If a novel is written from the perspective of ""adult reflecting on childhood experiences,"" it's an Adult novel. Why didn't they just publish this as Adult and let teens who are interested find it themselves instead of being creeps and telling teens they should be reading graphic sex? Sounds like the publishers wanted to capitalize on how being queer is ~cool~ and ~what the kids are into~ as if queer adults would not be the market for this, which is a) weird because the author is an adult (they don't act like one, but they are supposed to be), and b) doubly creepy and inappropriate because it infantilizes queerness.Show more"

I really enjoyed this memoir once I started it on audio. It was much too dry as a book I read, but became more engaging when listening to the author read it. It talked about the unique struggles of owning your identity growing up Black and Queer in America. Finding out about historical events outside of the white savior lens, bullying, SA by a family member, sports, family, coming out experience etc. Later chapters discussing his college years experience make this solely high school level student selection reading. This book gives insight to kids as to what to expect in certain areas. It’s an attempt to relate and educate so that kids may see someone like themselves living and thriving in the world. The author wanted to help teens find their agency and their voice as this was something he didn’t learn until he was older. It has a lot of value to a high school student who may be going through a similar experience.Show more"

This YA-focused book centers the experiences of George Johnson, a 30-something journalist and queer Black activist. It begins with his middle class upbringing in New Jersey and ends with his observations of life at a historically Black college in Virginia, highlighting the joys and pain of queer existence across many topics--homophobia, sexual abuse, violence, gender policing, denial, and finally, coming out. I loved this book. It wasn't until the end that I truly realized how rarely the queer Black experience has been written about, and done so with such honesty.

I used Apple Books for the audiobook, and the author read it. It was a marvelous book. The raw, completely exposing stories of the author's life differed from anything I've read recently.Synopsis: ""All Boys Aren't Blue"" is the memoir-manifesto of LGBTQIA+ activist George M. Johnson. His story begins in a middle-class Black neighborhood in New Jersey. From earlier on, Johnson recounts feeling ""different,"" but knew being a gay Black boy isn't an identity that is easy to accept. Johnson learns to successfully navigate the world as a gay boy hiding under heteronormative constraints. The author also documents earlier childhood trauma that takes his smile, sexual trauma in his tween years, and the damage from trying to hide your authentic self for years on end.Johnson is a great storyteller.

Johnson points out that there is a lack of YA books that discuss gay sex, a lack of books that address the perspective of queer persons of color, and a lack of books that show a queer person originating from a supportive environment. He wrote this memoir to try and address that lack. However, as a memoir? A 3. I wanted to enjoy this book, but while it had a stated trajectory, much of the included material detracted from the focus. Specifically, there was a lot about Greek life that didn’t serve the story. I also felt like Johnson tried to honor every person in his life, which in turn made parts of this book feel like I was being held hostage and forced to look at someone else’s family photos.That said, I would absolutely read something else by this author.

Everything Johnson touched on pertaining to being black in America resonated with me and it was just so refreshing to be able relate so heavily with his black experience. Although I don’t identify as queer, I believe that every single person should read this book if not only to empathize/sympathize, but to recognize the immense strength it takes to be queer and black in this terrifying world.

On the surface, this book seems like simply the story of the author’s life, but it’s so much richer than that. It’s a love letter to their grandmother, a message to queer kids on a similar journey, a smart and nuanced discussion of gender, and so much more. It celebrates the good in their life, but doesn’t hold back from frank discussions of the challenges they’ve faced, and I highly recommend it.

LGBTQ folks come out everyday they choose to live in their truth. George’s memories of his grandmother’s unconditional love and his brother’s admirable openness are simply beautiful. It would’ve been great to hear more about George’s personal relationship development (it’s briefly touched upon towards the end). Many LGBTQ struggle to develop intimate connections and form a partnership with another being and I think these extra anecdotes could really influence YAs struggling to feel and show love. Show more

Johnson uses his stories and experiences to explore the pervasiveness of toxic masculinity and assert the importance of respecting gender identity.

Si je connais un peu près le « concept » du mémoire — écrire sa vie mais sous un angle particulier, un peu comme l’autobiographie — je pense que je n’étais pas prête à lire tout ce que j’ai lu dans cet ouvrage. Pas dans le sens « ça m’a choquée » mais plutôt dans le sens où je ne pensais pas que l’auteur se montrerait à nu. C’est un peu étrange de dire cela parce que par définition, par l’écriture du mémoire, l’auteur s’expose à ses lecteurices. Du coup, je savais que j’allais me plonger dans la vie de l’auteurice mais peut-être pas à ce point. Je ne dis pas ça dans un sens négatif en mode « olala iel a vraiment trop partagé de sa vie » mais plutôt pour vous « prévenir » et vous dire que si vous pensez que l’auteurice aborde vaguement sa vie, ce n’est pas du tout le cas. Iel explique d’ailleurs cela dans sa note d’auteurice — que je vous conseille de lire parce qu’elle est très importante. Dans cette note, l’auteurice explique pourquoi iel a choisi de raconter son histoire de cette manière, mais iel explique également son utilisation de certaines injures raciales et homophobes. Si l’ouvrage aborde la vie de l’auteurice, de son enfance jusqu’à ses années à la fac, iel se concentre principalement sur l’intersectionnalité entre son identité queer et le fait qu’iel est noir.e. J’ai trouvé cela très intéressant et important parce que pour les personnes racisées, l’identité queer ne peut pas être séparée de l’ethnicité/couleur de peau. Beaucoup semble l’oublier. En ce sens, je pense que l’auteur voulait également rappeler que ce n’est pas parce qu’une personne blanche est queer qu’elle en perd ses privilèges liés à sa couleur de peau. Être queer n’efface pas sa couleur de peau. C’est pour cela que même queer, l’auteurice raconte tous les moments de sa vie où il a dû faire face au racisme en plus de l’homophobie.J’ai d’ailleurs beaucoup apprécié le passage où l’auteurice raconte son rapport à l’éducation et surtout à l’histoire des États-Unis. La manière dont iel explique comment une partie de l’Histoire est effacée au profit de certaines perspectives est quelque chose qui parlera à beaucoup de racisé.es. Iel explique en plus que l’apprentissage de l’Histoire dépend beaucoup de la personne qui l’enseigne : que dans l’école où il y avait une majorité de professeurs blancs, les cours incluaient que très rarement l’esclavage, la ségrégation — alors que ce sont des moments fondamentaux de l’histoire américaine. Iel compare cela au moment où iel est entré.e au collège où il y avait plus de professeurs noirs et où enfin, les cours incluaient ces moments.C’était des passages très intéressants parce que cela reflète la manière dont la majorité veut nous faire apprendre l’histoire : nous la faire apprendre en minimisant ce que les blancs ont fait. C’est en lisant ces lignes que j’ai pu faire un parallèle avec mon parcours scolaire — déjà j’ai toujours eu des profs blanc.hes — et notamment sur ce qui est dit de la colonisation en Asie et surtout, sur la guerre du Vietnam. On apprend presque rien de tout cela ou alors on apprend des choses mais toujours du même point de vue, celui qui fera passer la France pour les gentils de l’histoire ou du moins, ceux qui ont pas trop merdé. Mais saviez-vous que pendant la colonisation du Vietnam, les français ont supprimé, effacé notre alphabet ? Notre langue ? Et que c’est pour ça qu’aujourd’hui, le Vietnam utilise le même alphabet que la France ? (Plus exactement, ça avait commencé avec des missionnaires portugais au 16ème siècle mais imposé lors de la colonisation). Bref. Le mémoire se centre également — et surtout — sur la recherche de son identité et à quel point la société force des personnes comme lui — noir, queer — dans certaines cases dont il est très difficile de se défaire surtout quand on n’a pas le privilège d’explorer sa sexualité et son genre dans un environnement protecteur et sain. J’ai d’ailleurs beaucoup apprécié la nuance que l’auteurice apporte : le fait que s’iel a « pris du temps » avant de mettre des mots sur son orientation sexuelle — iel a fait son coming out à sa famille à 23 (25 ?) ans — iel a néanmoins grandit dans un environnement familial bienveillant. Iel explique ainsi qu’iel a eu une certaine « chance », contrairement à d’autres personnes comme lui qui n’avaient pas une telle opportunité. C’est pour cela qu’iel explique qu’iel a écrit ce mémoire pour permettre aux personnes comme lui de s’identifier à son expérience et leur faire comprendre qu’iels ne sont pas seuls.Le titre du mémoire — All Boys Aren’t Blue — est, à mon sens, vraiment symbolique du message que veut faire passer l’auteurice. La société, le patriarcat, veut nous faire croire des choses si stupides mais qui affectent fortement le développement de l’enfant — le bleu pour les garçons et le rose pour les filles. En écrivant son mémoire, George M. Johnson veut nous faire comprendre qu’iel existe des milliers de manière d’exprimer son genre, sa masculinité — ce qu’iel cherchait à atteindre pendant toute son enfance et adolescence — d’exprimer sa personne et que cela va au-delà d’une simple couleur. Iel explique que la masculinité n’est pas monolithe, que chaque personne l’exprime à sa manière.

Johnson narrates the audiobook of their own memoir so well. I loved listening to it. The voice of the narrative is great and the voice telling it makes it more poignant. This story is so important and real.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7440151-just-one-more-paige,All Boys Aren’t Blue,Rating 5 out of 5,"August 23, 2020",1 like,0,"This review originally appeared on the book review blog: Just One More Pa(i)ge. This recently released YA memoir jumped onto my TBR because everyone seemed to be reading it! It was the Libro.fm audiobook club choice for June (hosted by @absorbedinpages) and really the hype for it was real! Also, that cover is just stunning. Luckily, I was a very early request on it at the library and got it almost as soon as things re-opened for curbside holds pick-up. Yay!In this memoir and manifesto, George M. Johnson writes about growing up as a Black queer boy*. Covering topics including being bullied and trying to fit in elementary through high school in New Jersey, their time at and joining a fraternity in college in Virginia, their first sexual experiences (the good, the uncomfortable, the non-consensual and predatory), their relationships with family and especially a beloved grandmother, and more, Johnson opens up about their life in an effort to help create a sense of community for the marginalized, mistreated and often hidden population they are a part of: Black queer boys*. (*As of a few days, Johnson came out as non-binary, with preferred they/them pronouns, on social media. So, I will use those pronouns in this review, but will refer, as it comes up, to their childhood as a boy because that’s the way it’s discussed in the memoir itself. If there is a better or more respectful way to handle this, please let me know and I will edit accordingly.) I’ve seen some discussion about memoirs written by “young” people, those in their thirties and younger, and read some critiques of whether someone that age could/should be publishing memoirs. And I agree, there is much of their life left to live. But at the same time, as we get older, it becomes harder to remember what being young, and the feelings/experiences from those years, was like. And young people today, young people of any time really, face many very real challenges and discrimination…and I feel like they too deserve to have the chance to read about others like themselves, people who dealt with and survived similar things, and still remember the way it felt and can provide applicable and generationally sensitive advice. They shouldn’t have to wait and only read an elderly person’s remembrances of a distant past. Johnson describes this perfectly, and repetitively, in this book. They say over and over how they hope that reading this book will help just one person feel less alone or more understood. Johnson even specifically calls out a favorite quote from Toni Morrison, “If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.” For Johnson, there was not a book like this that was available to them when they needed it, and so here they are, writing it for someone else to have. In any case, this is not super related to the memoir or a review of its content/writing at all, but just my thoughts on a topic I’ve seen debated recently and couldn’t help but add my two cents to. On to the “real” review. It’s likely to be pretty short and sweet, because this was a great read, and that’s close to all there is to it. Johnson speaks with matter of fact statements about accepting others and dealing with trauma and what society should do/provide, especially to youth, and the many ways in which it doesn’t (especially for Black and/or queer youth). They also provide a straightforward, no obfuscation or beating around the bush, understanding of context and history and consequences of/trauma from appropriation for a YA audience. It’s done in a way that is clear and expressive and absolutely accessible and recognizable for a young adults and still holds great weight and messages for adult readers. Each chapter ends with a note of suggestion or empowerment or action step or question or statement of support for anyone marginalized by race and/or sexuality and gender, which I loved and, I hope, do what they are meant to in regards to helping young readers, like Johnson’s past self, feel fully seen. And those same notes/statements can and should be read by anyone not marginalized in those ways as a challenge, a calling out for allyship and support in stepping up to oppose those systems of oppression. They state that as one of their goals in writing this memoir manifesto, as I mentioned, very openly, and you can feel the emotion and effort they put into that aspect come through in the writing on every single freaking page. For me personally, I loved the sections that were written as letters and notes to/about his family members. They were incredibly touching and emotional and fantastically vulnerable (YES to that effort to fight Black male stereotypes!). And the general way they weave the negative effects of their constant masking, the difficulty of not fitting gender stereotypes, on their mental health, and the general focus on how important and necessary it is to address mental health issues, throughout the memoir also really stuck out to me. Finally, one of the most important themes of the book, and one the Johnson does a spectacular job staying consistent to and transparently unpacking, is the binary gender and sexuality norms and expectations of culture (in general), the way that affects anyone who doesn’t completely fall in line, and how it intersects specifically with Black cultural norms and expectations. Very powerful.  There is such a personality in Johnson’s writing. Their self shines through from start to finish, from what they challenge to who/what they love to how they speak and act and their general journey to discover and fully own who they are. It is, clearly, a journey that continues and will likely never “end,” but the way they so openly shared about these most vulnerable moments as they started into said journey is so admirable. Their passion and sensitivity (in all the ways that term can be interpreted, internally and interpersonally) in sharing how much they’ve learned and grown, how much is still left to discover, and how committed they are to helping those coming after them is beautiful. Here are a few passages I book-marked while reading:“As an adult, I have gone through the unlearning to understand that my community’s treatment of Black queer children is in fact a by-product of a system of assimilation to whiteness and respectability that forces Black people to fit one mold in society, one where being a man means you must be straight and masculine. I didn’t have the ability to separate my Blackness from my queerness. The loss of my smile was just as much a denial of y Black joy as it was my queer joy. When I did smile, it was a coping mechanism. My smile was a mask that hid the pain of suppressing who I was. Masking is a common coping mechanism for a Black queer boy. We bury the things that have happened to us, hoping that they don’t present themselves later in our adult life. Some of us never realize that subconsciously, these buried bones are what dictate our every navigation and interaction throughout life.”“Unfortunately, the creativity of children often comes under fire when It doesn’t meet the acceptable standard or gender performance.”“Sometimes you just don’t have the strength to carry the burden and do the job. Navigating in a space that questions your humanity isn’t really living at all. It’s existing. And we all deserve more than just the ability to exist.”“I use my history as a tool to fight against my marginalization. The greatest tool you have in fighting the oppression of your Blackness and queerness and anything else within your identity is to be fully educated on it. Knowledge is truly your sharpest weapon in a world hell-bent on telling you stories that are simply not true.”""No amount of money, love, or support can protect you from a society intent on killing you for your blackness, and shows that a community that has been taught that anyone ""not straight"" is dangerous.""“When I think about the number of queer people in my family I remember the argument people have about whether you are born queer or grow into it. I think the funniest part about that argument is that it doesn’t matter if queerness is by birth or by choice. It is who you are, and no one should have the right to change that.”“You don’t know what you like or who you are if you allow yourself to be fit into a box that society has made for you. Learn what you like and don’t like. Create the sexual environment that works best for you. Sex is a part of growth as a human regardless of gender or sexual identity. No one have the right to deny us the resources we need to properly engage with one another.”“Time waits for no one, and for Black queer people, there are too many trying to steal the little bit of time we have. So, live your life.”Show more"

The part that most stood out to me was how affirming his family was. I don't think I've ever read/heard about a black family that was affirming from the jump .. like didn't first hate him and then come around but was always there to support and love him, even if quietly and not out loud yet. Which ... is so disturbing to think about. Why do I automatically assume black families are homophobic. Like how quickly they adapted to his trans cousin's new name and identity?? Like wtf. That was beautiful and so so inspiring and i just need other black families to get on board!!! They should not be the exception but the rule!!!The frat also shocked me because wowwww 4 gay line brothers. And black men are notorious for being homophobic and black men in frats who are hyper masculinized, like even more so and i feel dumb but also society?? for making me shocked to learn there are openly gay men in frats. I needed this unlearning of what is possible and think his reasoning for joining the frat was SO interesting. Wanting to reclaim his masculinity as a form of self love because he admired it in other men in such a HEALTHY way omg. Healthy masculinity feels so rare . Like extremely. And i loved this for showing its possible !!!! A lil bit about like, it's ok to not be masculine too tho! Would've been nice There were times i was like eh because I don't care about reading about men but so important for queer black boys and probably all queer black people and I'm so thankful and impressed with his extreme vulnerability becauseeeee he went so deep! Was so honest and open! For the sake of protecting other queer black babies from going through his trauma, like that is so brave and compassionate. This book being banned is so sad because literally it could save someone's life. Seeing they are not alone in their fears and doubts and struggles. Knowing how to have safe sex and healthy relationships. Knowing that it's okay to be a black gay man who's masculine and feminine! Like could LITERALLY save someone's life and it pisses me tf off conservatives are trying to stop babies from reading this.Idk what a YA memoir is lol, like i guess designed for teens? Which was almost offensive because the language seemed really dumbed down and juvenile to me in some places and i feel like teens don't need that but maybe I'm just old. I read another review and okay yes lol, i was afraid of critiquing some things buuuuut yeah it was weird that he made such a big deal about his teeth getting knocked out because I felt that it didnt have to do with anything? Or maybe it was the fact that it could've been any of those reasons and who am I to dismisss someone's trauma but i feel like he didn't explain that well enough. And i don't understand why the name was such a big thing and why he compared it to the trans experience? And dead naming your cousin i THOUGHT that was inappropriate but maybe like ... she said she answered to both but ... Idk. So yeah def some odd things and valid critiquesShow more"

Johnson is one of the most important books out there right now, which is why it is also one of the most challenged/banned books in the United States since its publication. Johnson describes growing up Black and queer in his memoir/manifesto, but he does more than just tell his story. He explains to his readers how to do things better than he did, because though he grew up in a loving family, his family didn't truly know how to talk to him about his queer identity. There's so much talk about hetero relationships and sex, but nothing out in the open about queer relationships and sex. Johnson seeks to help others by demystifying the inner lives and the relationships of queer people through his book. But let me be clear- this book is not just about sex!! Only two chapters in the entire thing even dive into the topic. The rest of the book is about living and growing up as a Black queer person struggling to come to terms with that identity. Our teens NEED this book! They need to understand these things or, as Johnson points out, we put these teens at risk. Knowledge is power, and we need to stop removing power from our queer teens by keeping them in the dark. Instead, we need to talk about queer sex in sex ed classes. We need to have books like this one in our libraries so our students can learn about themselves by seeing the representation Johnson provides. We need to help teens feel safe by letting them know that we see them and support them on their own journey to finding themselves. Anyone who thinks that the two chapters in this book that directly discuss queer sexual encounters count as pornography have clearly never seen porn or read anything remotely close to erotica. That book series with fairies your teen is reading...the one that has ""Court"" in all the titles? The one you have absolutely no problem letting your 15 year old read? Yeah...that's more spicy than anything in All Boys Aren't Blue. The people coming after Johnson's memoir/manifesto are coming after it because he's Black and queer. Full stop. Let's not pretend this is about protecting our youth from the evils of sex and porn. The Internet has been around for your child's entire life, you think they haven't seen porn by now? Please. Sixth graders are having sex nowadays. Having a book like ABAB available to teens is crucial! The suicide rate among teens is so high, and among queer teens and teens of color is even higher. We need to set aside our puritan heritage and protect our teens, and sometimes this means being a little uncomfortable. If one kid realizes they're not alone in their struggles by reading this book, then it is worth all of the hand-wringing. So deal with it. I highly recommend this book. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Show more"

Some of the criticisms I've seen for the book have to do with the sexual scenes being inappropriate for teens. Here's the thing: 1) the book actually walks through everything that is going to happen in the book in the first chapter (including getting sexually assaulted, losing his virginity, etc.), so you really can't act like you don't know what the book is going to be about. 2) Young adult is a tricky age group. You have some books that are ""YOUNG adult,"" meaning they're ideal for kids 11-14 or so. Slightly older than middle grade, with subject matters that are very clean but about teens. Then you have ""young ADULT,"" meaning they're perfect for teens who are 16-18. This can be tricky to navigate sometimes. I personally feel that this book leans more towards the ""young ADULT"" side, but it is still YA. And 3) it never got graphic enough that I felt like it should have been presented as an adult book. I mean, Sarah J Maas has scenes in her series (which is considered YA, but should absolutely be considered adult) where characters have fluids dripping down their legs. THAT (imo) is a bit too graphic for YA, even if it is for a ""young ADULT"" novel. The book is fine. It is poetic at parts. Johnson does a great job of linking the past with the present and creating allusions to the past. Another book that does the same thing is Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You by Ibram X. Kendi and Jason Reynolds. I felt like they were hitting a lot of the same beats, especially when Johnson would talk about historical contexts. It is obvious that Johnson loves his family very much, and that was nice to read about. Now, I am not part of the community that Johnson is writing for, so keep this in mind. I am not Black or Queer. But I feel like there were points that I felt like the writing could have been better. There were moments that felt a bit strange given the subject matter (like when he deadnames his transgender cousin). Also centering his first crush around 9/11 was an interesting choice, and I am not really sure why it was framed in that way in the book. There were moments (like when he says he invented the turn honey child) that felt weird (as that term has been around for a long time!). Again, I am not the targeted audience, so maybe I am missing some cultural context, but I felt like some of these choices were a bit strange.Overall, the book is fine, and I found it enjoyable. It doesn't deserve the hate it is getting. I could absolutely see it being very helpful for some individuals.Show more"

I’d heard George M. Johnson interviewed and read some of his other writing, so I gravitated toward All Boys Aren’t Blue when I saw it on the 2021 “Most Banned and Challenged Books” list.The book’s description really tells it all: “Both a primer for teens eager to be allies as well as a reassuring testimony for young queer men of color, All Boys Aren't Blue covers topics such as gender identity, toxic masculinity, brotherhood, family, structural marginalization, consent, and Black joy. Johnson's emotionally frank style of writing will appeal directly to young adults.”I found the book indeed honest and accessible, and prefaced with a “warning” that there would be difficult subjects discussed that could make some readers uncomfortable. Johnson talks about his childhood and young adulthood, and his struggles with finding his identity as a Black queer man in a society and culture that he’s been taught to believe didn’t want to hear about it. He talks about always knowing he was “different,” as the cliché goes, in world that so frequently (and even before we are born, with the gender assumptions and reveal parties and such) wants to put us in one of two boxes. He talks about his steps and missteps, his relationships with his family, the trauma he experienced, navigating simply being a Black queer man out loud, and how he learned to live his authentic self.Most importantly, and this is my strongest belief about why we need to stand up to book banning in schools and libraries, the story speaks to young people who might be struggling with their own identities, who have little or no support around them, who feel there’s something “wrong” with them because they don’t fit into those tidy boxes. He often addresses his reading audience directly, and expresses his plaintive hope that maybe his story will help them know that they are not alone.I can imagine why some parents might not want their children to read this book. But maybe that’s part of the problem. Maybe that’s part of the reason so many LGBTQIA+ children harm themselves or end up harmed. Maybe if kids outside the boxes read about people who have been in their shoes, and not only survived but thrived, they’d feel less alone, less broken, less unloved and unwanted and afraid.Show more"

In 2021, All Boys Aren’t Blue was one of the most banned books in the US. It was censored or removed from school libraries across the country. “If there’s a book you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.”Favourite quotes:- ""No amount of money, love, or support can protect you from a society intent on killing you for your blackness, and shows that a community that has been taught that anyone ""not straight"" is dangerous.""- “When people ask me how I got into activism, I often say, “The first person you are ever an activist for is yourself.” If I wasn’t gonna fight for me, who else was?”- “Navigating in a space that questions your humanity isn’t really living at all. It’s existing. We all deserve more than just the ability to exist.”- “You sometimes don’t know you exist until you realize someone like you existed before.”- “Love who you want to love, and do it unapologetically, including that face you see every day in the mirror.”- “I believe that the dominant society establishes an idea of what “normal” is simply to suppress differences, which means that any of us who fall outside of their “normal” will eventually be oppressed.”- “But I love you all differently. Because each of you needs different things.”Takeaways:- Johnson, who grew up in New Jersey and Virginia, is Black and queer. They know what it’s like to have conflicting identities, and to discover your sexuality in the dark.- American history is the greatest fable ever written- I quite liked the term honeychild - The sad thing is, even something as innocent as an invented word can seem like a threat – a threat to masculinity, and the identity of other people’s children.- “You can’t say that,” they tell you. “You can’t act like that.”- Johnson’s childhood wasn’t perfect. But all things considered, they feel fortunate to have a family who accepted them. If only all queer children and teens could be so lucky.- In fact, while Johnson knew they were attracted to boys, they couldn’t allow themselves to be fully queer even in their fantasies. They would dream about having sex with boys, but as a girl.- Telling the truth can be freeing. No more shame, no more secrecy. - Young people should have proper sex education, and have access to the resources they need.- If someone sees themselves in this story, they’ll realize that they’re not alone.Show more"

Johnson, a black queer individual who grew up without the education, knowledge, and initial support that many queer people today sometimes have. It's a story about being bold and being unafraid to be yourself and speak up for yourself. This story is about love and loss of oneself before finding the peace within your truth. And everything that goes in between. ""Finding happiness is important. Sometimes it takes pushing yourself past your own boundaries to get to that place.  What I loved 💙 Before I start, let me just say that my rating is based on the writing style and feeling put into the audio recording of this book and not the life of George M. Johnson themself. I had the amazing privilege of hearing them speak at an event for my company earlier this month and wanted to listen to the book immediately. When the hold came in, I knew after the INTRODUCTION that I wanted to have it physically so I could annotate it. If you know me and read my reviews, you know that seeing myself in books in whatever capacity is important for me. Being that queer, gay family member in college was their experience, coupled with experiences that I have also lived and is still currently living in some situations. I'm rating this book in a way that shows my love and respect for other black and queer individuals who still haven't found themselves and are struggling to gain a semblance of support and normalcy. This was the book I needed when I was 13 and felt like I didn't belong with one gender or the other. Here's to helping me heal my inner child and continuing to live my life out and proud! What I didn't like ❌ Again, this is someone's lived experiences and there's nothing to dislike about the passion and drive given to a story like this. Tl;dr ✨ ""Sometimes you don't know you exist until you realize someone before you existed before.""  This story is powerful and brave. I needed this book when I was 13 and at 21, the age the author was when they graduated college and had already experienced much of what I have in life, I can say that this has healed something in me that I didn't know was still broken. I think regardless of who you are and what you identify as, you need to read this. Your identity and comfortability is what you present to the world and it's the most important factor in life to learn and make sure other people learn too.Show more"

J'ai conscience qu'il faut des livres comme celui-ci et que c'est une vraie chance d'avoir accès à ces représentations. Cependant, si je me base sur ce que j'ai lu, il faut que j'admette que je n'ai pas vraiment apprécié. J'ai trouvé que tout était très décousu, il n'y a pas de vrai fil conducteur à l'histoire, ce n'est même pas chronologique et j'avoue que ça m'a dérangé. J'ai plus eu l'impression de lire un recueil d'anecdotes que de vraies ""mémoires"". A côté de ça, je m'interroge vraiment sur le propos du livre en soi, j'avais cru lire quelques chose qui dépeindrait la réalité de ce qu'est être noir et queer aux États-Unis car c'est ce qui est vendu. Or, même même l'auteur.ice n'arrête pas de reutiliser ces deux termes, à la fin du livre je n'ai vraiment pas l'impression que ce soit ce que j'ai lu. On a la chance d'avoir quelqu'un qui a grandi dans une famille où son identité queer ne posait pas de problème, ce qui, je pense, est loin d'être représentatif de ce que la plupart des gens vivent malheureusement. Et pour le fait d'être noir, pareil, je n'ai pas en mémoire un passage décrivant la difficulté que ça a pu être alors qu'on sait que le racisme est très présent. Alors après je comprends que l'auteur.ice n'allait pas inventer des problèmes qu'iel n'a pas eu, mais c'est plus sûr la classification et comment est vendu ce livre que j'ai un problème. Au delà de tout ça, je n'ai vraiment pas accroché au style d'écriture non plus, j'ai trouvé que c'était très peu travaillé et aussi que tout me paraissait très ""auto-centré"" (je sais que c'est des mémoires, donc c'est forcément auto-centré mais là, il y a un truc qui ne fonctionne pas selon moi). J'ai aussi eu du mal avec au moins deux chapitres qui m'ont particulièrement dérangés. Le premier est parce que bien sur, les ME s'obstinent à ne pas mettre de TW et donc je ne m'attendais pas à entendre parler d'abus sexuels. Le deuxième est le chapitre concernant Hope. Ça m'a beaucoup étonnée de voir que l'auteur.ice mentionne son dead name, sachant que la personne est décédée, je m'interroge vraiment dans quelle mesure elle aurait approuvé ? Ce n'est, en plus, pas la seule fois où des anecdotes portent sur des personnes mortes, et à chaque fois les chapitres sont assez ""touchy"". Personnellement, ça me laisse une sensation assez étrange au final.

This meant going to places and discussing some subjects that are often kept away from teens for fear of them being 'too heavy.' But the truth of the matter is, these things happened to me when I was a child, teenager, and young adult. So as heavy as these subjects may be, it is necessary that they are not only told, but also read by teens who may have to navigate many of these same experiences in their own lives.""One of the best and most important books I've ever read, which furthers my disappointment that it's the third most challenged book of 2021. Johnson perfectly articulates the necessity of this book (specifically for teens, and especially those who are Black/queer), and includes a note on the types of subject matter it covers. Johnson doesn't shy away from experiences that shaped their life as if young adults aren't mature enough. They approach teens with the honesty and respect they deserve, taking them seriously as readers. Listening to this audiobook felt like being on the phone with a friend. I laughed, teared up, and genuinely felt moved by Johnson's story. I greatly admire their courage and vulnerability in writing this memoir. A beautiful storyteller and, from what I gather, a wonderful person. I have a feeling most people challenging this book feel offended/uncomfortable with Chapter 15, titled ""Losing My Virginity Twice."" Johnson details a couple of their sexual experiences with men. The purpose of this section is to educate queer teens on what sex can look like for them, a topic that is highly underrepresented and censored. Johnson concludes this chapter with an excellent quote, ""Will this part of my story be met with pushback? Absolutely. But I'll be damned if I don't tell it because of fear. My greatest fear is that queer teens will be left to trial and error in their sexual experience. It's worth me feeling a little embarrassed so that you all are a bit more prepared.""I think everyone would benefit from reading this book. If you're from any of its target demographics, you will see yourself in Johnson's words as I did. If you're not, there's so much you can learn from their experiences. If this book scares you because it's banned, that's even more reason to pick it up.Show more"

Or racism. or 2) ""I wanted to love this book because we need diverse books especially for Black non-gender conforming queer youth BUT THE WRITING WAS TERRIBLE!"".I don't care to respond to the first type of people. They're just always going to be like that probably. When they try to ban this book (as they have recently), we always have to stop that from happening knowing we will never change their minds or hearts. To address the criticisms of the second type of negative reviewer - When we talk about needing diverse books from the perspective of marginalized people, we can not choose the presentation & how the words are conveyed. The writing in this memoir is very conversational with the author's opinions and perspectives on personal events and social attitudes that he has feelings about and that directly impacted him. It's informative, it's relatable, it's honest. The writing is much like what you'd read on a blog or another social media platform. The author acts familiar and like he already has a relationship with the reader. This is a very friendly writing style to a lot of younger people. Do I think the writing is great? Oh my gosh, no I do not but it's doesn't even matter. The things experienced during the author's young life & early adulthood is crucial reading for Black kids struggling with their sexual & gender identity, and their blackness in the usually white-centric world they live in. If you want to support LGBTQ+ Black youth ,you have to put words like this from LGBTQ+ Black adults who have lived through some things into their hands. Don't ask them to write it the way you want it told. How they tell the story does not matter at all. It's the content that matters.

This book features prominently on banned book lists, which made me (and hopefully a lot of others) more eager to read it. I wasn't quite prepared for this incredible memoir. George M. Johnson doesn't hold back when telling his story, and while parts of it are difficult to read, there's a lot of positivity and hope that shines through. The audiobook is narrated by the author, giving it an even more personal feel. And it already feels pretty personal, since he doesn't hold back on the most painful and joyous times of his life. As an effeminate Black boy, he went through his share of difficulty in his early years. Fortunately, he was blessed with a lot of supportive family members. However, this didn't stop him from being bullied, and he openly speaks about being molested. It was so interesting to hear about his own experiences, both as a child and as a young adult, and I can only assume that this book is banned because he not only talks about his molestation, but also his early sexual experiences openly. But this was never done in a flashy or inappropriate way - he talks about his emotions and coming to terms with his sexuality in a world and culture that isn't very kind to queer people, especially those of color. But he also talks about his own personal journey towards acceptance and forgiveness, offering information and hope for others who may have experienced similar things. And he clearly states that while he was able to forgive people who hurt him, he is aware that this isn't the path that everyone needs to take.This is an amazing book, and rather than being banned, it should be encouraged. Because there are people who have experiences like him, and seeing themselves in these pages and knowing that things get better can be incredibly helpful. Show more"

I’m glad I did.This book is Johnson’s memoir, and one that only covers their childhood up through their young adulthood. It can be quite heavy at times, dealing with Johnson’s knowledge from an early age that they were somehow “different” but unable to pinpoint in what way, and even deeper stuff like the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of their cousin. It’s very raw, all of what Johnson presents to their readers. But Johnson’s aim was to write a book that they would have wanted accessible when they were younger. While it was extremely difficult for Johnson to grow up as a queer Black kid, they were very fortunate to have a family that always loved and protected him. That can be very rare for a queer kid especially in the 1990s, but still even today. It’s amazing to think about all of the queer literature that’s available to kids now, complete with modern language and terminology. I barely knew what “gay” meant when I was a teen, mainly because no one ever talked about it, except in veiled whispers.There were a few things that bothered me a bit about this memoir, however. As others have mentioned, it is a little on the preachy side. I realize it’s written for a YA audience, but kids are smart — you don’t have to lead them to your point every time. I also cringed a bit when they deadnamed their trans cousin Hope. I mean, they could have easily have channeled their inner Victorian author and use “J—” instead of the actual name. It just feels so disrespectful to deadname a trans person, even if they’re no longer with us.At any rate, I’m so glad Johnson put this out there for teens to read. I’m hoping more and more queer authors tell their stories too, ones that are similar to Johnson’s and others that are vastly different. We need to hear everyone’s stories, and learn to do better by each and every person.Show more"

This book is marketed as a ""memoir-manifesto"" with the words ""be bold, and brave, and queer,"" meaning that we were already falling dangerously into 'challenged book 'territory since that seems like the most common theme for challenging books.Now I do have to say, the scenes especially in the chapter ""Losing My Virginity Twice"" and ""Boys Will Be Boys"" were explicit. Do I think it was written to be erotic? No, but that doesn't change the fact that those scenes are explicit and may be distasteful for some readers. Concerning the content of those chapters and the overall theme of the book, discussing themes of molestation and sex with a younger reader might be the best course of action especially with growing book challenges. Things I think this book did very well: discussing peer pressure while young, public school education discrepancies with the black community, poverty, black culture, transgender & dead-naming, coping with molestation, family death, defining masculinity, homophobia being tenfold because of one's race, and sexual education from the point of view of a gay man.Things I think this book didn't do very well: keep a consistent timeline, thematic balance between sections, boring and often textbook-like chapters, and sporadic characters just being inserted into the plot only to move away or pass away.

My copy is filled with pen marks and underlined passages. This is basically a collection of stories sectioned into chapters that follow his life starting from birth. There were some passages that hit me harder than others, but the entire book is worth your time. There’s a section on Lincoln that made me angry again at the school system, and I don’t have to tell you that the sections on racism and homophobia are deeply upsetting. As they should be. This book is not an easy read, but it really shouldn’t be. We need to be uncomfortable. It’s been a while since I’ve read a memoir, and I want to thank Farrar Straus Giroux for sending me this ARC. It was the right time to read this. It’s about so many different things. Dealing with trauma, bulling and violence, microaggression, the stigma of seeking help for mental health, how his family came together to support him (“We did what we always did as a family—we loved each other harder.”), learning to love yourself, how American history is based on lies that we’re taught throughout school, and what it means to grow up black and queer. It’s about so much more obviously, but those are a few. The writing style isn’t fancy, but it hits hard, it’s strong, simple, smart, and to the point. The focus is on the issues. The section on the power of names is one that will stick with me forever. Also anything about his Nanny. What a woman! Just want to share a few quotes that stuck with me: “Our community struggles to connect with joy in the way that we have with pain.”“My mom survived her surgery that day, and I learned a valuable lesson about holding on to trauma. It’s necessary that we do the work to unpack our shit. It’s time for the world to let queer Black boys unpack their shit. Smile, Black boys.” (the story this goes along with would help for context, but this quote goes along with the first one about struggling to connect with joy)“You sometimes don’t know you exist until you realize someone like you existed before.”“American history is truly the greatest fable ever written.”“Even today, institutions are still having ‘The first Black person to…’ And it means something.”“Even though my dad was a cop, he knew that being his child wouldn’t protect me from how police interacted with Black boys.”Some sections hit me harder than others, but overall I'm very happy to have read this book.

I truly hope that it finds its way into the hands of all the people, young and old, who need to read it because it reflects their story and their struggles - so they can see themselves represented authentically. I tell my students that we read in order to connect to others - so that we can appreciate, acknowledge, and make visible what Elie Wiesel called ""the otherness of the other."" It is in the space between us that we can grow. As a teacher with all of the privileges (white, straight, married, male, aged 25-50), this book presents the challenge to me to make sure that I am doing all I can to create safe spaces for my students to navigate the complexities of their identities. To make sure that they are seen and have agency. And to make sure that students have access to stories they see themselves in. Recommending this book for my students, which I fully plan to do, will be a delicate task because of the descriptions of sexual encounters. While extremely important to the story and well-written, those chapters are in the uncomfortable ""my middle-aged male teacher recommended this and he knew about these sections"" area. It'll be a tightrope act. Why only 4.5 stars? There were a few spots that dragged a little, where the individual story could have been tightened up just a bit. Or, to be more specific, the book is at its best when it is telling a story, and sometimes the commentary leading up to a specific story got in the way. These bits of commentary stood out to me because the vast majority of the book was so good and well paced - a great balance of commentary, story, and trying to find a moral or purpose. So when the commentary slowed down the momentum of the book, it felt clunky. But those sections were few and far between. Show more"

What a celebration of the Black family! George Johnson couldn't have been adored more by his family who loved him, and let him be who he was: a queer Black boy, who needed to take the long way on his journey to identify as gay. You should be so lucky to have had a Nanny (George's grandmother) in your life who loved and supported you so unabashedly as George's did. His mostly unaffectionate father even showed up for him with his limited range of emotion and displays of love. And his strong mother, who let George have agency even as a young child - she trusted him to make decisions for himself that would allow him to do the same as a young adult. Time and time again, this family, 'The Village' as George calls it - shows up for him. There is even a transgender cousin who is welcomed and respected at family events. Even when things are unspoken - there are messages sent and received of decency and tolerance. When he arrives to college, he is embraced by his fraternity and his fraternity 'line brothers' of Alpha Phi Alpha, another brick in the wall of support for George. Bravo to Alpha Phi Alpha - who shines in this example of an HBCU at Virginia Union University. If families and communities like George's could exist everywhere - the world would be a better place. I hope all the kiddos who identify as LGBTQIA in the high school in which I teach can have this kind of unconditional support, love, and encouragement.

I’m really glad I did. George Johnson narrates the audio version of their memoir and I always enjoy listening to memoirs when the author does the narration. Aimed at young people, especially those who identify not only as Black but as queer, this is a heartfelt, emotional story. They talk about their struggles growing up “different.” I loved how most of their family was completely supportive of them but it saddened me how much they had to go through. Bullying by schoolmates and getting their baby teeth knocked out when quite young, being just the first among quite a few traumas they relate. There are explicit descriptions of sexual encounters, so this is definitely aimed at older teens. Johnson grew up in New Jersey, not far from where I live now, and they are approximately the age of my youngest son, so I could really relate to their descriptions of the times they lived in/lived through. While an extremely strong book as it is, it might have been even stronger if it wasn’t aimed so specifically at a relatively small slice of the American population. A broader audience needs to hear/read this story and learn.Some excerpts of note to me:“Adults who participate in homophobia create kids that do the same.”“Homophobia denies queer people happiness. I imagine there are a lot of queer people who would love to play sports or do traditionally “masculine” activities, but they hold themselves back based on the fear of interacting with people they can’t trust. People who have made it very clear that queer people are unwelcome despite the fact they have talent. Homophobia is the reason that so many who currently play sports area closeted - as there is no way football, baseball, and basketball are 99.9 percent heterosexual.”“Saying that something was ‘a norm’ of the past is a way not to have to deal with its ripple effects in the present. It removes the fact that hate doesn’t just stop because a law or the time changed.”Show more"

Johnson wanted to write a young adult memoir to fill a void due to a lack of representation in their space, as a Black, queer, non-binary individual. They write that they hope if the book can comfort or inspire at least one person, it's worth it, and I agree. Having representation in books and other forms of media is important, especially for vulnerable populations like the author represents.Johnson is an older Millennial, and since we're nearly the same age, I loved reading a book from their perspective. They detail their life growing up in New Jersey, struggling with identity, going through experiences such as bullying and sexual assault, having a trans family member and various family dynamics that shaped their development. Ultimately, the author finds a strong community once they enter college at a historical black university and become a member of one of the school's fraternities. There are still heartbreaking moments, such as the loss of one of their fellow young fraternity members.Each chapter of the book focuses on a particular story or theme in Johnson's life. Some chapters are presented as second-person letters to a specific person, which is an interesting storytelling technique. Even when some of the stories seem perfectly ordinary, each chapter concludes with some sort of interesting fact about society and/or thought-provoking call to action for readers to consider.Most chapters weave history and teachable moments, like critical race theory or statistics about LGBTQIA+ populations, into the personal vignettes. I appreciated this way of writing, because while Johnson grew up in a somewhat stable environment, including going to a private Catholic high school, they are able to still shed light on more challenging struggles Black and queer populations face. Readers learn about unjust inequalities ranging from swimming/drowning statistics, to disparities in (lack of) safe sex education, to poor educational standards that don't teach the full view of American history and the leading role Black people have played in it. Surely Johnson's book will be a comforting read for Black and queer populations, especially young people who feel isolation or who don't have a supportive role model they can look up to. Johnson repeatedly offers words of encouragement and support for people like them. While they often felt alone as a child and teenager, their book serves to support future generations and challenges all readers to fight for equity for diverse populations.Show more"

It’s not a book I would have sought out or picked up or read on my own had I not been asked to examine it for an outside purpose. Quite frankly, it’s not written for 40-something white heterosexual women. But - oh my goodness - what a gorgeous book! What an important book! What a book that I would love to buy and keep on my shelves and get into the hands of boys who need to read it. I also think that there are people for whom the book is not intended who should read it all the same- just like I did - to window into the lived experience of someone with a different background. Maybe it would teach us empathy and to be a little more loving, caring and open minded. In the first two pages of this book, Johnson pens his rationale for writing it in the first place. He warns vulnerable readers what is on the pages ahead, which gives them an opportunity to set it aside if they are not ready. Yes, this book speaks frankly about sex - and homosexual sex - which I know triggers (and, for some reason, angers) lots and lots of people who look like me. I don’t know if there is anything that I can personally do to fix that. All I can hope is that people with an open heart and an open mind can open their ears to an honest, raw, and poignant story like that of George, Matt, MJ. At the same time - the book is NOT about sex. It’s about love, especially the love of a family. It’s about growing up black and queer in the mid 90s and early 2000s, and looking at life through the lenses of both identities. It’s about identifying and reckoning with abuse, trauma, and poor choices. It is such a good, good book rife with valuable lessons for all people. Show more"

Johnson chose to share their life story so queer teens today have a resource to turn to, and so maybe their paths will be just a little easier than Johnson’s was. That’s something to celebrate, and the content gets a high rating from me, especially for its intended audience — teens and young adults.But — and I know this is about to make me sound like a pretentious jerk — I struggled a lot with the writing.

What is the difference between a memoir and a YA memoir? Somebody help). I WILL say that I listened to this as an audiobook and at times it felt like we'd met up for coffee and the author was just telling me about his life. It is very open and personal. As someone who was also called by her middle name by her family and then got to secondary school, where my French teacher decided she liked my first name better, so that's what she'd call me (I've been called Carla by my friends that I made past the age of 13 and Sofia by my family and some old friends), I related to that chapter. Would I equate my name experience with the experience of a trans person being dead-named and misgendered at every turn? Absolutely not. Which brings me to the part that really ruined the experience for me. Johnson somehow thought it appropriate to constantly use his cousin's dead-name (as well as her friends'). Sentences along the vein of ""he became a she and I was happy for her, and hey let's just call him Hope now"" were way too frequent and left a bitter taste in my mouth. The pronouns were so interchangeable and yet it felt like showing of a badge of honour ""when my cousin changed genders, I accept him - uhm her as the very first person in my family"" ... I don't think it was meant that way. And maybe it was even written with his cousin's consent - I don't actually know these people - but it really ruined the book for me. I couldn't enjoy the rest of it afterwards because I couldn't get over it. There were some good parts and seeing as I'm not the target audience anyway, I decided to still give it 3 stars.

The memoir is well written, but I felt like an intruder while listening to it and the structure made me confused.Let's talk about the structure first - The memoir begins with an introduction to the author's childhood and their experience growing up as a queer black child. The narrative then shifts to talk about the people surrounding them in their childhood, told in what I understood as letters to the person that the chapter was about. The narrative then shifts again, away from the letters into George M. Johnson's more directly told memories and experiences. I found this structure somewhat difficult to follow - I didn't understand the changes at first, or who the author was talking to during the letter portions of the book. Also, I desperately  wanted more  of the personal opinions, experiences and events in the life of the author (similar to the beginning and end of the book). I felt like there was so much more that we didn't get into, and the author just scratched the surface of race, sexuality, and life.I particularly struggled reading the letters. I was often confused about who was who when the author mentioned multiple different people, and I couldn't quite catch up on the events being described. Overall, I felt like the letters were very much intended for the recipient and I was a lurking intruder, eavesdropping on private correspondence. This made me feel off, and I struggled to keep listening to the book. I liked the idea about the book including personal letters to friends and family, but they would have to be more general about events and other people. I don't know how the print or e-books are set up, but also reminders about who the recipient of each letter was to the author were needed.I'm sad that All Boys Aren't Blue wasn't perfect. But I'm really happy that I read it regardless! The book talks about heavy subjects that desperately need more air time - grief, loss of a friend and family member, abuse, and racism.

He covers topics such as gender identity, toxic masculinity, brotherhood, family, structural marginalization, consent, and Black joy. And the wonderful thing about this book is that it was clearly written for young queer Black kids to ensure that they can see their lived experiences in media. As someone who is of a similar age as the author, I can say that I never had access to queer stories like this growing up. Part of that makes my inner-child really sad but I mostly feel grateful to the author for being able to put his truth out there for a younger generation. A note: I ended up switching over to the audiobook which I think helped increase my overall enjoyment. The writing style does come across as meant for a younger audience (which, yeah.. it's a YA memoir.)

I bought this because there was so much controversy surrounding it based on groups of parents across the country trying to get it banned from schools and calling it pornography. Because these are the same people pushing against the made-up CRT bogeyman, I had my doubts, so I had to find out for myself.Although the book does contain a few scenes that could be considered sexually explicit, they are included with intention. The author is very transparent about wanting young adults to be able to read about experiences that may be similar to their own. When he was growing up, George Johnson never saw his own experiences represented in any books, movies, or any other art forms. And he wanted to write the book that he so badly needed. With that said, I personally would not recommend handing the book to anyone under 16, but I think it’s fine after that point.The rest of the book is a beautiful portrayal of family, friendship, and community. Although Johnson’s childhood had its share of discrimination and bullying due to his sexual orientation, he was also blessed to have a supportive family and many friends who actively and lovingly supported him throughout his life. This is not only a book that will help young LGBTQ people develop a healthy sense of self, it could also serve as a manual for people who want to really, truly support the LGBTQ friends and family members in their lives.Show more"

This was my choice. It is written for young adults and is currently one of the most banned books in the U.S. The language used by the author is obviously, to my adult ears, written to appeal to its intended audience. As a cis-gender female senior person, I was glad to read these words written by a person who has experienced discrimination for two reasons: being black and being queer/gay. The ongoing struggle to become the person that felt right was, and perhaps continues to be, a difficult one, given the expectations of society. Born in 1985, George didn't ""come out"" until he was 25, therefore having lived until then keeping secrets about himself, with the resultant difficulties that brought. George has become an activist, journalist, and now a published author of this book. In my opinion this book should be available to all young adults, those who are ""straight"" and especially those who are questioning. Explicit descriptions of sex between two males is probably the main reason this book is banned (is called pornographic). But as the author says, he didn't know about gay sex and in writing this book he shows the way to those who are questioning. The variety of essays include memories, letters to others, both living and deceased, who have impacted his life, as well as documentation of gay and black history. One good thing about banning a book is that it grabs the attention of potential readers, and thus increases its readership! And certainly increases sales, since it is not always available at the most logical place for young adults to find books: their school libraries.Show more"

But what makes the book powerful not just being gay, but also multigenerational understanding, as well as his blackness and being gay. This is a very powerful book for anyone to understand who is trying to deal with being gay. One of the reasons I read the book is it’s a banned book. Shame on anyone who is responsible for banning books to begin with. Yes, there are sensitive topics. This is the parent’s call not yours. You are responsible for your own kids. Not someone else’s. Let the parent, parent! I’m a parent to a 30 year old and I didn’t have to deal with this. But it’s a difficult world now, hard enough. The people like the author in this book may help someone.

Not from closeted truths, but from a trusted, lived experience, a shared example.Many passages are indeed confronting to those of us not experiencing this marginalisation, as it should.

The memoir is arranged in parts, thematic to his childhood, his family, teen years, & college. He brings up so many parts of society where he felt isolated or uneducated in the complexity of his identity and marginalization. Despite an incredibly supportive family & history of queer family members, he shows the fear of rejection and his quest for masculinity that took him years to truly come out to his family and friends. He also addresses reproductive health in schools and how they can be more inclusive and educational for all people to help promote safety and wellness for all. I learned so much, and it is a well-written memoir focusing on marginalized teens, who he hopes to help feel not as much alone or rejected. He also addresses the differences in education based on the population of a school & how representation matters. “Are you teaching people how to swim or are you letting them drown?”“Being queer is a journey. One that is ever changing as identities that were once in the dark and come to light. As relationships that once needed to be hidden come to a place of greater visibility.”“How do you just trust someone with the biggest secret in your life.”“Love who you want to love and do it unapologetically, including that face you see every day in the mirror.

I actually wasn't going to read it, but every time it kept popping up in articles my interest was strengthened.This was an interesting book for me because it's so different than my own experience growing up. As a suburban-raised, heterosexual female, there were ample opportunities for me to learn about romantic and intimate relationships: family, movies, friends, classmates, books, magazines, songs, and even church. And of course, I still had questions despite all abundant resources. I cannot begin to imagine the struggle of Black queer boys trying to learn about adulthood, and romantic and intimate relationships. Do they have examples in their family? Perhaps, but unlikely. In movies? no idea, but I can't think of any except for stereotypes in comedies. Do their friends discuss it? Doubtful. And on and on.So if one person is brave enough to write an honest authentic book about his own experiences, the author should be praised. Is there sexual content? Yes. The sexual content is more descriptive than Judy Blume, as an example from my childhood. However, countless youth learn of equally descriptive heterosexual intimacy through siblings, peers and entertainment. George Johnson is the older brother needed by so many young people.Show more"

Johnson tells his youth from birth to graduating college during the 80s and 90s in the US. This memoir is semi told in chronological order with separation of overarching themes. As he explained, this book is meant to be a YA memoir for youth to learn and perhaps in something they see themselves. George's constant battle during his youth was his inability to recognize himself completely in others due to lack of representation and education to give him the knowledge and language to express himself in his entirety. Although I am not a Black queer man, I am an Asian woman and I felt myself relating to many points made, especially in the early sections, about childhood trauma, intersectionality, and lack of representation. I have loved to get to know George's family through his recollection and, y'all, Nanny is the BEST! For all intents and purposes, I want to give this a 5 stars so youth can find and have access to this book (although it is the third most banned and challenged book in 2021 according to the American Library Association, so...I digress). However, I felt the last section fell short for me. When it comes to the parts regarding his fraternity, I can't help but feel an undertone of the toxic masculinity ingrained in greek life. Even as far as to write, ""The fraternities were built on principles of masculinity...'manly deeds'"" (pg. 250). This talk of masculinity really irked me as a woman. I completely understand the formative experience he has with his ""line brothers"" in becoming his complete self and comfortable coming out. All throughout the book, George is aware and acknowledges his privileges and differences that gave him an advantage, so it seems like he completely subscribed to the idea of masculinity in the frat's definition if he was unable to find criticism in this section.Show more"

All Boys Aren’t Blue takes you on a journey— George’s journey—of both Blackness and queerness, their intricate intersection, their complicated existence, and the many ways in which those identities are at war with one and the world. I’m still processing this book but what struck me the most was the fact that it was so centered in love, understanding, brotherhood, connection, and acceptance. And what I felt, as a reader, is that George exemplified that so well as he diverts from storytelling to speak directly to the audience. It’s as if you’re in his living room as he so warmly, informally speaks to edify, enrich, engage, and even enliven with a laugh or two. As a Black boy who didn’t firmly fit the mold that was presented to me, it’s true— all boys aren’t blue. The world isn’t black & white (unless it is, if you catch my drift). But it is full of color. Color that— maybe— if we take a moment to sit, stare, and absorb (just as one would at an art museum), maybe we could understand it. If we can understand it, maybe we could appreciate it.

My hope is that when people read this book, they take this feedback and insight to heart. There was one thing they said (and I’m paraphrasing) that we all need to really commit to memory: Your intention is not what matters.

Throughout this memoir, we get a complete picture of what life can be like for young, queer Black boys. So many moments feel so incredibly personal, and I can only imagine how difficult and cathartic telling these stories must have been. They are personal and vulnerable, and it’s important that stories like this are told. This is geared toward young adults, but I love that it never shies away from complicated or difficult parts of life. It’s raw and thought-provoking, and what I think makes this necessary reading is the way Johnson talks about a myriad of issues. There is the obvious homophobia and tribulations of being a Black queer man, but there are the difficulties in growing up not understanding his own sexuality and how that affected him through adolescence. “American history is truly the greatest fable ever written.”I always cite How the Word is Passed by Clint Smith as a book that should be required reading.

Johnson was an incredibly vulnerable memoir covering his childhood, teenage years, and coming into his identity as a young queer Black man. This YA novel was both informative and authentic. Johnson’s essays were raw and empowering, especially for queer Black youth. Not only did he cover common issues such as bullying, flaws in the educational systems, and toxic masculinity, he shared his family values, friendships, and Black joy. I can easily understand how important a book like this would add value to the LGBTQIA+ community, especially for those in need of guidance. As Johnson noted, he did not have that added support while growing up in the form of books like his. So, by sharing his own experiences, both good and bad, his book may act as a hopeful reminder for those that it reaches. As for fellow allies, this is still a very important read too. We might not be able to grasp what it’s like existing in a world so adamant on oppressing others. But we can learn, unlearn, and call out the bs.

Because they worked so much, the author spent much of his time with his grandmother and brothers. Most of the content in the book is him acknowledging that he felt different from a young age. As an adult writing about his past he is able to explore specific instances where he felt societal pressures to hide his effeminate nature such as playing football instead of jump roping as a child at recess. I appreciate that he shares even the uncomfortable stories. These are likely the stories that have caused this book to be on many banned book lists. As he says in his book, telling those stories isn’t just for him. Perhaps he is helping someone going through the same thing. Whether that thing is struggling with their identity, surviving sexual assault, or being a minority at a school. He mentions in the book is how there is no sexual education for anything outside of the heterosexual norm where procreation is the point. As a straight, married woman, this isn’t something I had ever considered. Part of why I enjoy reading books that are banned is to expand my personal knowledge.

Reading this book felt like a warm hug from someone in the queer community who has been around to see just how much has changed and how we have room for improvement. This memoir was not only eye-opening but heart-wrenching and raw. So often, black queer people's voices are silenced even in our own community, and this book is a reclaiming of the power of a community built by those black and brown queer people. I think this is such an important book to read, especially for queer youth who don't often see themselves in media. With that being said, I did wish it was longer, and I would have really enjoyed a few chapters about current modern day and the author's growth after college, but as I always say, wanting more of something is never inherently a bad thing.

Johnson, and his story as a gay black man. He shared stories and reflections of his experiences growing up, living in a black neighborhood, surrounded by a loving family, and going to different schools, some with primarily black students and teachers, others with primarily white students and teachers. He writes with clarity and vulnerability about his journey in discovering and defining himself. His voice is genuine, pure truth. And will hopefully reach people needing to see themselves on the page as well as people looking to understand. Breaks my heart that it is a banned book. His voice is compelling and needs to be shared.I love George’s family, especially Nanny. I read her chapter on my own deceased grandmother’s birthday, and it made me cry. He is right, there is no book without her. “Your saving me will allow me, my words and our story to save others.” Nanny is a beautiful soul.I strongly recommend the audiobook, which is narrated by the author.“I hope this book will open you up to understanding the people you may have never spoken to because of their differences from you. We are not as different as you think, and all our stories matter and deserve to be celebrated and told.”Show more"

They want to write their story to be able to make room for other stories to be told. By telling stories from their childhood George make brilliant reflections upon racism, injustice, gender roles, growing up as different and much more. The way family life is describes is so loving and beautiful. Their family have a strong love for each other and whatever hardship they face seem to bring the family even more together. George’s portrait of his grandmother Nanny is so beautiful but also the way they write about their transgender cousin Hope, who died tragically too early, really gets to my heart. This book is an easy read so I can highly recommend it especially to young people also growing up trying to find their own way in life. It’d also be an amazing book to read as an adult wanting to support young people in your life, and it’d make a great book to have conversations about in for example a book circle. So make sure you’ll pick this book up because it might be one of the most important reads right now!Show more"

En muchas de sus vivencias me hizo volver a momentos claves de mi infancia y adolescencia que ahora adoptan otra perspectiva de como las sentí en esos momentos. Por ese lado, el libro me encantó y dejó un gran aprendizaje en mi.Por otro lado, entiendo que es importante dar voces y que exista la representación, sin embargo, me da la sensación de que quiere ser más de lo que realmente es, constantemente en sus historias me daba la sensación de que eran un ""Sé que muchos sufren esto... por suerte en mi caso no"", básicamente, quiere incorporarse en situaciones que realmente no llegó a experimentar y deja un regusto de que escribe desde cierto punto de ""superioridad"" o ""privilegio"" ajeno a las personas que quiere/dice representar.En resumen, sería un gran libro si solamente se basara en toda la falta de educación y apoyo que experimentamos en etapas tempranas de nuestra vida cuando sentimos que no encajamos con los ideales de género que impone la sociedad tanto desde el punto de vista de ""negro"" o ""queer"" o como incluso estas dos comunidades pueden ser contradictorias.

I really enjoyed learning about the authors life, family and experiences. Johnson does a beautiful job showing the tension between his identities, growing up Black and queer. My favorite parts were where he wrote open letters to family members, which were very moving and introspective. It was wonderful to see an example of a family who loved, accepted and protected their queer son, which I honestly don’t think we get to see too often in the media. While I loved the content, I found Johnson’s commentary and delivery to be a bit off and even problematic at times. Through out I felt the tone felt more directed to educate a non Black and non queer audience rather than his intended audience of Black queer boys. I’m curious if anyone else felt this way or if that’s just a reflection of my own identity. I also felt that he centered himself in a cringy way at times. Don’t get me wrong, I know it’s a memoir, but saying he invented the term “honey child”, dead naming his trans cousin, and turning his fathers time in the hospital into a story about how his dad couldn’t attend his party felt pretty off. All and all, my harsh critiques don’t take away from how important Johnson’s story is. This memoir could be a needed self reflection for other black queer folks with similar experiences or an important jumping off point for those wanting to learn more about intersectionality.

Here’s the thing about this book: I think the messages in it are super important, and Johnson’s story is one that needs to be told. However, there was something about it that didn’t resonate with me personally. I think part of it was the writing style. The sentences felt very short and abrupt at times. And Johnson read it in a way that was very matter of fact. Both of those stylistic elements weren’t very personally captivating to me. But there was something else, too, and I feel kind of bad about this because it’s not my place to judge how anyone chooses to process, interpret, and feel their own lives experiences. But, with that being said, Johnson was too forgiving for me. I feel like he had a lot of grace, and in some cases, forgiveness for members of his family. I think that’s great because, obviously, it is ideal for people to have healthy relationships with their family. I think I just would have felt differently about a lot of what he expressed. And I understand that I am a perennial pessimist and quick to judge, so I’m certainly not someone to model yourself after, but it’s for those reasons that I just didn’t love this book. Show more"

Anyone who interacts with black-queer youth should require themselves to read this book. In the collection of essays, the author weaves a tapestry of a young life, full of experiences that any isolated/closeted queer kid can identify with and from them learn some valuable lessons. It is critical of white, heterosexual norms. Which is exactly why white people should read this book too.It is very candid and in some parts graphic though it is never PORNO-graphic. The essays detailing his molestation and subsequent sexual encounters are vivid, but come from a sincere place. A place where hope intends to educate marginalized queer kids about the dangers and joys of sexual encounters. The author comes from a tight-knight family of modest means, so LGBTQIAP+ persons who are living in poverty, or in a domestically violent home may find it a bit polly-anna’ish.I read this book as part of the 2023 Read Harder Challenge for the audio book written and narrated by a person of color.Show more"

It is important to remember that it is written to a younger audience but I appreciate that the author does not shy away from more mature topics. It is the story of being black and being queer and all of the complicated experiences and relationships and discovery that come with both of those identities. My only problems were some continuity issues within the stories (but if I tried to write my life story down I am sure there would be many a discrepancy between reality and my truth). Only advice is to read the trigger warnings at the beginning and be aware that they don't give any warnings throughout the novel that they are about to dive into more serious or triggering subjects. Other than that one of my favorite parts of this novel was their justification at the beginning for writing it in the first place. They talk about how being the one to tell their story and be vulnerable is hard and painful but it is always worth it in the end to tell your story because you never know who it can help.

It made the 2021 Most Banned and Challenged Book List by the American Library Association (ALA)I read this book because it was one of the most banned and challenged books in 2021. I am highly disappointed in this move by closed-minded parents. This is a complication of essays that cover Johnson's life from childhood to college graduation. There is a bit of unwanted molestation as a child and then losing his virginity in college, and yes, it is to a man. This book is more than that, but he is completely honest. It is about sexuality versus gender which are discussions that need to be talked about to have an understanding. He is Black and gay where there are challenges being one or the other, but combining the two creates more challenges. He was very lucky for having a family that was accepting of him, and wishes his family was more of the norm. When books like this are banned where are youth that are struggling with their sexuality going to go to find out they are not alone.

Author George M. Johnson tells us about growing up in Plainfield, New Jersey, under the watchful eye of the grandmother he calls Nanny due to his parents working very long hours. He keeps trying to be what everyone expects him to be, but the only thing he seems secure about is being intelligent. He'd rather hang out with gal-pals than boys his own age (the exception being his cousins) ... and he pretty soon figures out that he really has no interest beyond friendship with women.However, it takes George a long time to accept that he's gay, let alone be out to people, and this book deals a lot with that.Aimed at an audience that may be facing similar struggles, Johnson's memoir is an important book that, unfortunately, is facing a great deal of censure from would-be book banners who have clearly never read the work. It belongs in high school and public libraries, because there are people who need this information so that they know they aren't alone.Show more"

I thought it worked very well as a YA memoir, imparting lessons that are important for teens to know without feeling it it was talking down to them or dumbing down the language. The calls for LGBTQ+ youth to get the same chances to explore dating/sex at the same time as their peers, and with equal sex education, were especially important. I hope that part of the book can empower queer teens to keep themselves safe and listen to their own wants and needs. I really appreciated hearing about the other queer people Johnson knew throughout their life. We're truly not alone out there, even if it might seem that way.I did get a bit of a sense that the author was looking at some things with the rose tinted glasses of adulthood, focusing less on how they might have felt at the time, and it made some things seem a little less genuine.

Near the end of the book, Johnson shares his second sexual experience. While more detailed than the first, Johnson wrote honestly about the encounter. Nary an ounce of salaciousness on the page.So what is all the hubbub about? Perhaps it's because Johnson shares his life story in a positive light. Perhaps it's because he continuously questions the social and political structures that have framed our society since before we were the United States of America. Perhaps it's simply because this openly proud and confident queer black man is sharing his lived experience?Regardless, I recommend this memoir for readers in high school through adulthood.

I really appreciated him shining a light on that issue since it’s one that can easily get overlooked. All of the essays in this flowed really well into each other to the point where I almost forgot I was reading a nonfiction! I couldn’t put this book down, I kept wanting to learn more about the author and his experiences!I will never be able to truly understand what the author, the Black community, or the LGBTQ+ community go through, but this book helps shed a light with beautifully put words, and I highly recommend everyone read this.The last thing I’ll say is this quote from the book, which stood out to me when thinking about our current political climate:“I think the majority fear becoming the minority, and so they will do anything and everything to protect their power.”Show more"

It is addressed to black queer boys, but everyone can gain something from this novel. I loved this book. It was fascinating learning about how black culture interacts with queer identities and what it’s like to grow up in that environment. Johnson’s personal stories were intriguing and grounded the novel, showing real life application of the ideas discussed. All Boys Aren’t Blue was also kind of a depressing read. As discussed in the book, society has so far to go for actual acceptance of black and queer identities.

I always have trouble rating and reviewing memoirs because how does a reader critique someone's personal life experiences? It is what it is; but I'll do my best. First off, Johnson doesn't hold back, so good for him. He said what he said, no bullshit, no I'm sorry but...ect. I enjoyed when he wrote about his family that's where I most connected to the story. I connected also with the idea of not being fully accepted because of the way you were born. However, some of the tone of the book rubbed me the wrong way. There was a lot of anger that seeped out his story, and I get that, being black and queer and just overall mistreated will piss anyone off. And having to hide who you are out of fear and maybe some points shame will give you rage. However, the issue I had was Johnson seemed to be a hypocrite at times. Ex. He calls out a white teacher for saying that slavery was something of the times; and that if he lived back then he probably would have slaves too. The teacher only says this after being pushed by Johnson, saying just because it was of the time doesn't make it right. Johnson is correct in saying this of course; but I think what the teacher was trying get across, it that was just how it was, we all have social norms in every time period good and bad. I think most people agree that slavery is and was disgusting; I just want to make that clear. What bothered me later though was when he talks about his Nanny (Grandma) and how she called all white people the devil because she grew up with Jim Crow and KKK. He goes on to say it was because she grew up in that time, he says this and he just leaves it. He does not say ""Hey Nanny those white people during that time were wrong and thats awful but not all white people are bad ect. He only calls out racism on one side and not the other. I get that are still racists to this day; but my point is, it's not right to call all white people the devil because of the time period in which you grew up, just like it's not to say the N word because of time period where you grew up. That is what bothers me. He accused a teacher of trying to excuse racism away ,and he Johnson did it too, that is where my issue lies. But that aside, I liked what Johnson was doing. Giving a voice to the unseen, the unheard. Having pride in his own blackness, his own self, as well others like him; and maybe reaching others who can relate to being different in someway.

The second half was better than the first but regardless this book was rough to get through. For someone who professes how incredibly smart they are, it was not written well. “I did this. I was that. I know this. I went here.” It often read like an essay written by a fourth grader. The other issue I had was his outright racism. For someone who wants the world to stop using labels, he sure loves to use them. I don’t disagree that there are inherent biases in our culture, but to find racism in the copper penny is seriously stretching the bounds of being offended. He claims that he can find issues with every situation, and I believe him. Because he’s looking for ways to be offended and blame the world for his problems. Every transgression that he experienced he equated to an issue with our country and specifically white folks. So very egocentric. I became dizzy from my constant eye rolls as he expects everyone to accept him while admitting he doesn’t reciprocate.I read this book as it’s been getting heat from parent groups, mainly for the descriptions of the author’s sexual encounters.

He is Black and gay, or queer, depending on your age and terminology. As with so many of us, his youth is filled with covering - masking his sexuality in favor of social acceptance. His school experiences vary, from largely-Black public schools to predominantly White Catholic schools. As a white male coming from a family with educational aspirations and some money, I stand acutely aware of my privilege. My opportunities were far greater, and my sufferings far easier than Johnson's experiences. His aim in writing this young-adult memoir is not to reach survivors like me, but to help those facing these experiences at the outset of their adolescent-to-adult lives. While his ""life lessons"" seem often simple, sound advice, they are surely much more profound to his intended readership. Ultimately, I am the wrong reader for this work, and need to withhold judgment in favor of applauding those he wants to help, and those he doubtless will help, and the author himself, for making this laudable outreach.Show more"

I also greatly respected his love of family and how he cared for his Nanny - reading those parts made me wonder if I have done my job as a parent - would my own children be willing to change an adult diaper or help a grandparent undress? I don't know. A few of my other favorite parts of the book were the speech at graduation and how the other student didn't understand at all AND when George goes away to college and expects all of his challenges in his life to be instantly fixed - and they aren't. Is this writing excellent? No, not at all. The messages come through regardless. I'm so thankful George wrote this memoir and I could hear about his journey. Show more"

EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.This is a memoir of the author and I listened to an audiobook which was also narrated by them and I loved it.Their main purpose of writing this book is helping POC LGBTQ+ people out there by telling their story. And to educate and show a unique perspective to the rest of us. For me, as a cis person, this was a reality check and definitely educational moment. They went through trauma and SA and it was heartbraking to read about it. They mostly focused on the fact of being different and the struggles of figuring out how to act and be yourself in non accepting environment. But they also wrote a lot about family and their values and that was absolutely beautiful. I loved their family and I feel like I got tho know them though this book. I wish I had a grandmother like them, she sounds wonderful.This book is alive. This book is a person. Thank you George for giving us a glimpse.Show more"

I hadn't heard of George M. Johnson and knew his life would be very different to my own. However, after hearing more about All Boys Aren't Blue in the media I felt compelled to read it.I've read more diverse fiction but George's memoir was my first taste of non-fiction books about the black and LGBTQIAP+ communities. I found his vulnerability and honesty about his experiences growing up very enlightening. The first half was very insightful. I particularly liked how when referencing important topics and opinions he would mention certain figures in history so I had more resources to do extra research on my own.However, I did find that the writing could be a bit simple at times. I would've liked him to go into some more detail and include more general information about LGBTQIAP+. Despite that, I can see how beneficial it can be to young adult readers even though there were certain points that may be slightly too mature. I've decided to rate All Boys Aren't Blue as 3.5 stars overall. I found it very insightful and look forward to reading more books like it.Show more"
