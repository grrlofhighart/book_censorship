On prodding him for the reason behind his 'disinterest', he replied that 'books written by women just do not engage' him. I didn't have the heart to ask him why a second time.And there it sat between us, this knowledge of his disdain for women writers (for some hitherto unknown reason), like a breathing, venom-spitting, invisible monster quietly killing our conversation (thankfully!).No evasion. Not even a half-hearted attempt at rescuing an uncomfortable situation. A wholly unabashed, flat out declaration made with the confident, self-righteous air of a reader who knows what good reading should consist of and, when it comes to that, exclude.In retrospect, when I dwell on the memory of this horrendous, very real conversation, I experience a crushing hopelessness. It's not that particular guy I am mad at. No. He is only a minuscule part of the universal malady afflicting our collective psyche. It is this spirited tolerance for continued ignorance and apathy that infuriates me so. This tradition of belittling the female voice which speaks of personal sexual gratification, love, marriage, and childbirth, of the tyranny of beauty that forces her to adhere desperately to some predetermined standard of physical perfection - the right angle to her cheekbones, the right slope to her nose, the right lushness to her eyelashes, the right curve to her hips, the right skin color to match her hair and her eyes. All of this is terribly uninteresting isn't it? 
""It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question. The master had said, 'You are ugly people.' They had looked about themselves saw nothing to contradict the statement; saw, in fact, support for it leaning at them from every billboard, every movie, every glance. 'Yes,' they had said, 'You are right.' And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it.""
So what if she is a Nobel laureate? So what if she created the most haunting, poignant and unforgettable elegy to the horrors that American slavery spawned? So what if she has crafted an eleven-year-old, ugly and unfortunate Pecola Breedlove with the utmost sincerity? So what if she has made her ugly and unfortunate Pecola yearn for a shred of love and dignity in vain till her last days? So what if she has tried to shed some light on the unloved, the mercilessly trodden upon rejects of a community caught in the vicious trap of fatal self-loathing? So what if she has thought up a newer way to deconstruct the violence of a sexual crime by removing the convenient 'glamour of shame' routinely heaped on the victim? So what if she has tried to bestow humanity even on the ones beyond redemption? So what if she has offered a window into a world where a million and one injustices compete for primacy every moment?Such trifling womanly subject matters do not mesh well with the reading tastes of a man! After all, the Doris Lessings and Elfriede Jelineks, Nadine Gordimers and Alice Munros, Zora Neale Hurstons and Zadie Smiths, the Jhumpa Lahiris and the Banana Yoshimotos, the Brontë sisters and Virginia Woolfs, write/wrote books for only women to read and appreciate.'Women can't paint, women can't write...'It hurts to know that the Charles Tansleys of the world are alive and well. But, thankfully, we have the Toni Morrisons to restore some balance.Show more"

I think that part of this has to do with the unfortunate connotations people have regarding Oprah's Book Club and part of it stems from, if not outright racism and misogyny, than the racist and misogynist assumptions that Morrison is popular only because she is a nonwhite woman, liberal guilt etc. The latter is false: Toni Morrison has won the Pulitzer and the Nobel because she is an excellent author.N.B. - Before I get jumped on by total strangers for making assumptions about Morrison's detractors, these are actual comments about her books, from Amazon.com:""Toni Morrison is the most overrated author in America, it's only because of Oprah (the most overrated ""personality"" in America"") that she is popular.""""You know, I know blacks have had a hard time in this world...I'm not naive...but there's a right and wrong way to tell us about your problems. This book is an example of the wrong way. To me it came off as preachy and heavy-handed.""""Once again, Toni Morrison puts an assortment of diatribes and racial angst into book form and masquerades it as literature with a moral message.""""What is actually between the covers of the book is 150 pages of the gross aspects of sex and femine hygene. That is not what makes brillant writing.""""The Bluest Eye does not celebrate the beauty of the black individual but instead simply and grotesquely trashes white characteristics (i.e. blonde-straight hair/blue eyes.) So if a little blonde-haired blue-eyed girl reads this book is she supposed to feel ashamed to have these characteristics?""""I think it's terrible that Oprah Winfrey would recommend a book as anti-white as this. It's not as bad as some ""black"" literature that blames everything on white people, but it's close.""It's foolish to assume that the thoughts and experiences of women and of nonwhite American citizens is not worthy of writing about, and reviewers that slam the book as ""anti-white"" completely miss the point of themes of cultural hegemony, internalized hatred, taboos in beauty and sexuality, oppression, etc. And it's just darned lazy to discount this book's beautiful use of multiple narratives and excellent turns of phrase. Morrison's literature often makes me angry and depressed, but not as angry and depressed as some of the reviews it gets.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,The Bluest Eye,Rating 5 out of 5,"April 4, 2022",552 likes,0,"Toni Morrison is one of my favorite authors. I discovered her writing with Beloved for which have a copy signed by her at a reading in Brooklyn of Jazz decades ago. In The Bluest Eye, she looks at the intersection of racism, self-hatred, poverty, and sexuality with realism and her beautifully descriptive writing style. The book starts off with one of Toni Morisson's typically powerful opening lines:Quiet as it’s kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father’s baby that the marigolds did not grow. (loc. 110) We see this flower analogy towards the end of the novel again. Beautiful but hopeless prose:Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. (loc. 118) as well asThere is really nothing more to say—except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how. (loc. 121)A beautiful metaphor for living in a racist society:Being a minority in both caste and class, we moved about anyway on the hem of life, struggling to consolidate our weaknesses and hang on, or to creep singly up into the major folds of the garment. (loc 235)I liked the feminist message in this paragraph on how girls are given dolls to instruct them subconsciously in their future roles as caretakers (thus why I didn't buy dolls for my daughter):I was interested only in humans my own age and size, and could not generate any enthusiasm at the prospect of being a mother. Motherhood was old age, and other remote possibilities. I learned quickly, however, what I was expected to do with the doll: rock it, fabricate storied situations around it, even sleep with it. Picture books were full of little girls sleeping with their dolls. Raggedy Ann dolls usually, but they were out of the question. I was physically revolted by and secretly frightened of those round moronic eyes, the pancake face, and orangeworms hair. (loc. 265)The beautiful difference between what people think she wants and what she really wants:Had any adult with the power to fulfill my desires taken me seriously and asked me what I wanted, they would have known that I did not want to have anything to own, or to possess any object. I wanted rather to feel something on Christmas day. The real question would have been, “Dear Claudia, what experience would you like on Christmas?” I could have spoken up, “I want to sit on the low stool in Big Mama’s kitchen with my lap full of lilacs and listen to Big Papa play his violin for me alone.” (loc. 287)How mass-culture is used to instill a racist hierarchy of beauty and value:The best hiding place was love. Thus the conversion from pristine sadism to fabricated hatred, to fraudulent love. It was a small step to Shirley Temple. I learned much later to worship her, just as I learned to delight in cleanliness, knowing, even as I learned, that the change was adjustment without improvement. (loc. 304)Wow, this is one mean, low-down couch!  It withheld the refreshment in a sleep slept on it. It imposed a furtiveness on the loving done on it. Like a sore tooth that is not content to throb in isolation, but must diffuse its own pain to other parts of the body—making breathing difficult, vision limited, nerves unsettled, so a hated piece of furniture produces a fretful malaise that asserts itself throughout the house and limits the delight of things not related to it. (loc. 495)Brutal about how we feel we are perceived modifies behavior and thinking and reinforces poverty:They lived there because they were poor and black, and they stayed there because they believed they were ugly. Although their poverty was traditional and stultifying, it was not unique. But their ugliness was unique...You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. (loc. 505, 511)How our dreams eventually lose out to reality:This family, on a Saturday morning in October, began, one by one, to stir out of their dreams of affluence and vengeance into the anonymous misery of their storefront. (loc. 520)Fascinating, the two Christs here:(Cholly was beyond redemption, of course, and redemption was hardly the point—Mrs. Breedlove was not interested in Christ the Redeemer, but rather Christ the Judge.) (loc. 555)How hate can be self-sustaining:Hating her, he could leave himself intact. (loc. 562)The downward spiral of toxic masculinity:Even a half-remembrance of this episode, along with myriad other humiliations, defeats, and emasculations, could stir him into flights of depravity that surprised himself—but only himself. Somehow he could not astound. He could only be astounded. So he gave that up, too. (loc. 565)The eye analogy is, naturally, one of the most important throughout the entire book:Try as she might, she could never get her eyes to disappear. So what was the point? They were everything. Everything was there, in them. All of those pictures, all of those faces. (loc. 599)Pecola was, for me, a truly heartbreaking character:Each night, without fail, she prayed for blue eyes. Fervently, for a year she had prayed. Although somewhat discouraged, she was not without hope. To have something as wonderful as that happen would take a long, long time. Thrown, in this way, into the binding conviction that only a miracle could relieve her, she would never know her beauty. She would see only what there was to see: the eyes of other people. (loc. 616)The problem of peaking too early and being considered a weed instead of a flower:Nobody loves the head of a dandelion. Maybe because they are so many, strong, and soon. (loc. 626)Sad description, but so apt:She looks up at him and sees the vacuum where curiosity ought to lodge. And something more. The total absence of human recognition—the glazed separateness. (loc. 643)There is always humanity and humor in Morisson's work:“Well, this hippo had a ball back in Chicago. Whoa Jesus, ninety-nine!” “How come you always say ‘Whoa Jesus’ and a number?” Pecola had long wanted to know. “Because my mama taught me never to cuss.” “Did she teach you not to drop your drawers?” China asked. “Didn’t have none,” said Marie. “Never saw a pair of drawers till I was fifteen, when I left Jackson and was doing day work in Cincinnati. My white lady gave me some old ones of hers. I thought they was some kind of stocking cap. I put it on my head when I dusted. When she saw me, she liked to fell out.” (p. 729)A poignant description of winter:By the time this winter had stiffened itself into a hateful knot that nothing could loosen, something did loosen it, or rather someone. A someone who splintered the knot into silver threads that tangled us, netted us, made us long for the dull chafe of the previous boredom. (loc. 800)The mystery of racism to children:What was the secret? What did we lack? Why was it important? And so what? Guileless and without vanity, we were still in love with ourselves then. We felt comfortable in our skins, enjoyed the news that our senses released to us, admired our dirt, cultivated our scars, and could not comprehend this unworthiness. (loc. 983)How a town's name can make some people dream:When you ask them where they are from, they tilt their heads and say “Mobile” and you think you’ve been kissed. They say “Aiken” and you see a white butterfly glance off a fence with a torn wing. They say “Nagadoches” and you want to say “Yes, I will.” You don’t know what these towns are like, but you love what happens to the air when they open their lips and let the names ease out. (loc. 1069)This is so beautiful:That is what she herself did. But to find out the truth about how dreams die, one should never take the word of the dreamer. (loc. 1424) as is this:She had not known there was so much laughter in the world. (p. 1498)Ostensibly, this paragraph is about rotting teeth, but it is also about how repeated violence rots out the inside of many, many women:And then she lost her front tooth. But there must have been a speck, a brown speck easily mistaken for food but which did not leave, which sat on the enamel for months, and grew, until it cut into the surface and then to the brown putty underneath, finally eating away to the root, but avoiding the nerves, so its presence was not noticeable or uncomfortable. Then the weakened roots, having grown accustomed to the poison, responded one day to severe pressure, and the tooth fell free, leaving a ragged stump behind. But even before the little brown speck, there must have been the conditions, the setting that would allow it to exist in the first place. (loc. 1501)Such a wise deconstruction of romantic love and physical beauty in society's eyes:Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. (loc. 1572)The horror of a white hospital treating black pregnant women:When he got to me he said now these here women you don’t have any trouble with. They deliver right away and with no pain. Just like horses. The young ones smiled a little. They looked at my stomach and between my legs. They never said nothing to me. Only one looked at me. Looked at my face, I mean. I looked right back at him. He dropped his eyes and turned red. He knowed, I reckon, that maybe I weren’t no horse foaling. (loc. 1607)Beautiful description of freedom:They were, in fact and at last, free. And the lives of these old black women were synthesized in their eyes—a purée of tragedy and humor, wickedness and serenity, truth and fantasy. (loc. 1794)One of Toni's more ingenious sentences in this wonderful novel:Only they would know how to connect the heart of a red watermelon to the asafetida bag to the muscadine to the flashlight on his behind to the fists of money to the lemonade in a Mason jar to a man called Blue and come up with what all of that meant in joy, in pain, in anger, in love, and give it its final and pervading ache of freedom. (loc. 2076)I had to look up 'Moirai' which turns out to mean 'the Fates':Public fact becomes private reality, and the seasons of a Midwestern town become the Moirai of our small lives. (loc. 2395)Incredibly powerful passages continued:I thought about the baby that everybody wanted dead, and saw it very clearly. It was in a dark, wet place, its head covered with great O’s of wool, the black face holding, like nickels, two clean black eyes, the flared nose, kissing-thick lips, and the living, breathing silk of black skin. (loc. 2433)A little black girl yearns for the blue eyes of a little white girl, and the horror at the heart of her yearning is exceeded only by the evil of fulfillment. (loc. 2659) Even her waking dreams we used—to silence our own nightmares. And she let us, and thereby deserved our contempt. We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength. (loc. 2676)The sad fate of Pecola:We substituted good grammar for intellect; we switched habits to simulate maturity; we rearranged lies and called it truth, seeing in the new pattern of an old idea the Revelation and the Word. She, however, stepped over into madness, a madness which protected her from us simply because it bored us in the end. (loc. 2680)A beautiful, sad ending:And Cholly loved her. I’m sure he did. He, at any rate, was the one who loved her enough to touch her, envelop her, give something of himself to her. But his touch was fatal, and the something he gave her filled the matrix of her agony with death. Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover’s inward eye. (loc 2683)This book should probably be considered post-modern in the sense that the narration moves from character to character and it is up to the reader to intuit the speaker and the time at which the action is happening. True love as represented by the blue eyes and blond hair seen in the movies frequented by Frieda and Claudia as well as Pauline and most of all, Pecola, is as inaccessible as their parents' understanding leading them to either steel themselves against feeling like their mothers have or go insane:Pauline: ""It would be for her the well-spring from which she would draw the most destructive emotions, deceiving the lover and seeking to imprison the beloved, curtailing freedom in every way.""As Wright and Ellison had described as well, life in the North was not a safehaven free from racism. Cholly was just as invisible in Ohio as he would have been in Mobile. The White ticket counter is still forbidden him when he buys his ticket to see his father. His Aunt and the women that raised him ""ran the house of white people, and knew it. When white men beat their men, they cleaned up the blood and went home to receive abuse from the victim.""The cycle of violence feeds on itself leading to tragic consequences for each of the characters.In today's amerikkka of immigration quotas, race-baiting, and continued white police-on-black violence, The Bluest Eye still remains as relevant today as when Toni Morrison published it in 1970 - 23 years before 1993, the year she was justly awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.

""Is she saying what they did was okay?! Is she telling us they weren't to blame and we should feel sorry for them?!"" I remember writing my ""objective"" and ""tone-neutral"" in-class essay while trying to stifle my own feelings of resentment. I know now that the answers to those two questions were no and no. What Morrison wanted us to do was not pardon the terrible acts of her characters, or brush them off as ""simply tragedy"" but to understand where these characters came from psychologically, and what made them the the way they are. People are driven by motivations, sometimes selfless, sometimes self-serving, and sometimes cruel. When I think about this now, I'm absolutely floored. I don't think any work of fiction has ever taught me this huge a lesson about human nature than this one. Morrison is a brilliant writer and this will probably always be one of my favorite novels.Show more"

Our peripheral existence, however, was something we had learned to deal with--probably because it was abstract.""- Toni Morrison, The Bluest EyeI'm rereading Morrison's books in chronological order in 2016 and I created a private group here on Goodreads for a few of us who are interested in doing the same thing. Discussing this book with others has been very interesting because we all have different perspectives and can share them, expanding our own understanding of the book, it's been a great experience.It's been four years since I first read The Bluest Eye and I was extremely touched and saddened by it the first time around. I count it as one of my favourite Morrison books and I'm glad to say that after a reread it's still very much so. I'm trying hard to find the words to describe how I feel about this book and it's still hard because it's a gut-wrenching book which I love, though ""love"" sounds like the wrong word for it: how can I love a book that is filled with so much pain, sadness and grief? This book condenses so much tragedy, despair and sadness in a relatively small space. What do you focus on? It can get a bit overwhelming. Morrison's advice seems to be:  ""There is really nothing more to say--except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.""Whenever I discuss this book with people I know, Pecola is often the first name that comes up. Pecola, the poor, unloved child who prayed for blue eyes. It was hard not to draw comparisons between her and Celie (The Colour Purple), another abused black girl who was called ugly by all those around her. And I think of all the little black girls I've known who hated being black, who hated their hair, their noses, their eye colour, who prayed for ""good hair"", lighter skin complexion etc.Morrison shows the vulnerability of children so well, and the consequences of parents not telling them what they need to know in enough detail, which results in them being forced to draw conclusions on their own. What they aren't told, they glean from observations and discussions with each other. Sometimes the truth isn't known until they are older:  ""My mother's anger humiliates me; her words chafe my cheeks, and I am crying. I do not know that she is not angry at me, but at my sickness.""There are so many parts of the book that show children as voiceless, black children in particular. There's the issue of representation and how the white dolls our parents thought we wanted probably did more harm than good. I think this is an important book in revealing the other America. My book had an afterword by Morrison which I'm so glad I read. I had no idea that this book was inspired by a conversation she'd had with an elementary school friend who prayed for blue eyes. It's conversations like this that never leave you, it seems, but it might take you until you are an adult to understand the true meaning of what those words held and what they say about our society. Like Malcolm X asked, ""Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet?""  ""And twenty years later I was still wondering about how one learns that. Who told her? Who made her feel that it was better to be a freak than what she was? Who had looked at her and found her so wanting, so small a weight on the beauty scale?...I focused, therefore, on how something as grotesque as the demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child; the most vulnerable member: a female.""- Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye afterwordShow more"

She says it best about The Bluest Eye.“If happiness is anticipation with certainty, we were happy.”Set in Loraine, Ohio in 1941, young girls, Claudia and Frieda MacTeer welcome an 11-year-old girl, Pecola Breedlove into their home. Pecola is temporarily sheltering with the MacTeer family while her father is in jail.“Each night, without fail, she prayed for blue eyes.”“He laughed the grown-up getting-ready-to-lie laugh.”The last half of the book presents the backstory of Pauline Williams (Mrs. Breedlove), Cholly Breedlove, and Mr. Henry.Who-eee! Sumptuous and majestic, Toni Morrison’s prose is like running your hand through stardust. Her prose is astoundingly sophisticated, whipped smooth—a phenomenon of a debut novel. The first half of the book is an electric triumph, a richly insightful tale of a cruel and broken world balanced with humor and the excitement of anticipation and hope. Unfortunately, the spell was broken in the last half of the book. While the bits of stardust still lingered, the enchantment was waning.To step back for just a moment, The Bluest Eye starts off with Claudia MacTeer’s first person narrative and shifts into a third person omniscient voice. Ugh! This did not work well.How does an author decide which parts of a story to include? To a certain extent, it boils down to personal choice.My personal philosophy closely alights with Philip Pullman, and he wrote a really great article that fits nicely here. In the essay, “The Path Through the Wood,” Pullman likens writing to a path through the woods. The danger is that authors might be tempted to get lost in world building (“the forest”). The idea is that when authors leave the path (stop moving the plot forward), readers lose interest.In The Bluest Eye, Morrison wants to build up her world by focusing on multiple characters. Because she casts the net wide, she can’t go deep, and the stories would have otherwise been stronger.At the same time, it is admirable that Morrison attempts to show the complexities of her characters. Cholly Breedlove isn’t merely a “baddie”; he is a nuanced character—a victim of trauma suffering abandonment and alienation.In another essay by Pullman, “The Writing of Stories”, he talks about where the author puts the camera, whose voice do we hear. Morrison’s indecision in selecting a narrative voice is amateurish and confusing.All that to say….You don’t have to take my word for it!Here is Toni Morrison:My solution—break the narrative into parts that had to be reassembled by the reader—seemed to me a good idea, the execution of which does not satisfy me now.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,The Bluest Eye,Rating 3 out of 5,"February 25, 2015",217 likes,1 comment,"3.5/5 starsI found The Bluest Eye to be structurally disjointed but fluidly written. Each sentence bled into the next, urging the reader to press on amidst a heartbreaking, convicting story of rejection, self-loathing, and ultimately, complete violation. It's not easy, or particularly enjoyable, to read. But Morrison cracks open this sort of taboo topic, choosing to highlight a character whose story often goes untold: that of an ugly, black girl. But Pecola, our main character, doesn't even get to tell her own story. The novel breaks down into seasons, starting with Autumn, and is narrated by a neighbor girl and her sister. As the story progresses, we get backstories on major characters: Pecola's mother, father, and various people in their hometown of Lorain, Ohio.While I loved the prose--there's no denying Morrison's skill with words, especially as this is her first novel--I found myself having trouble fully engaging in the story. As Pecola's story unfolds, we realize that she is helpless to deal with the pain she is going through, and she internalizes it. She isn't even helped by the people in her life who should be able to help her, because they have their own pain to deal with. This isolation Pecola feels kept me at a distance from her, combined with the fact that we don't get to hear from Pecola herself at all. And by the end I was a bit let down. During the afterword of the novel, written by Morrison herself, she says regarding the structure, ""My solution--break the narrative into parts that had to be reassembled by the reader--semed to me a good idea, the execution of which does not satisfy me now. Besides, it didn't work: many readers remained touched but not moved.""I think, therein, lies my exact problem with this book. That isn't to say that this book isn't worth reading, or that it doesn't achieve anything that it sets out to achieve. Instead, I felt so detached and confused by the structuring of the story, that I missed out on the emotion that was being expressed.It's an excellent novel, nonetheless, but it's also a first one; I anticipate in reading more of Morrison, I will grow to understand her writing, as I often do in reading more from the works of an author.

I read Lolita without any complaints about the paedophilia because sometimes it is necessary to show despicable things in order to create art. I’ve read stage pieces by Sarah Kane which involve genital mutilation and all sorts of brutal sex acts, but, again, it was necessary for the piece. Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus  centres on a very brutal rape, that much so that people fainted when it was performed (and that was in 2014 at Shakespeare’s Globe in London), though it was needed for the nature of the revenge plot.  However, sometimes the brutality can be a little too much. This book contains an explicit child rape scene and vivid animal cruelty. Granted, you could make the same argument to defend The Bluest Eye as I did for the texts I mentioned above though, for me, it was just too awful to read. The scenes held absolutely nothing back. I am not a person easily shocked or put off by such things, though it was too much even for me.  The Republic of Wine is the only other book to make me feel this unnerved (because of baby cannibalism.) It made me want to vomit as the writing here did. The Bluest Eye was way too much for me. It was overly symbolic, melodramatically brutal and displayed no hope or optimism. I did not enjoy a single page.Show more"

So she believes she is unlovable, and is subsequently rendered invisible and therefore a perfect target to absorb the abuses of a society of self-hating, oppressed people who need to pour their sorrows into the vessel with the most cracks: the innocent (in their eyes, contemptible) black girl.

First, I want to say that I didn't have to read this book for a school/college project, or anything. I had just finished reading the memoir ""Black Boy"" by Richard Wright (which has turned into my favorite most relatable black memoirs of all time). This was given to me by a close relative who loves reading too. Every other black person I've seen (especially the conscious brand) tells me this is a ""African American classic"". I just don't see it, at all...  I do not want to write a mean review because if I were to be the author of this book, I would much prefer constructive criticism and not just 'hating'. To the author's credit, she's very good at getting her audience's attention even from the very first chapter, and she knows how to turn anything she creates into poetry. She has a very good way with words and making her writing sounds sophisticated and artistic. So those are her pointers. Now to to the critical bits... Problem #1: It feels Toni's method to gaining reader's attention, is being unnecessarily and forcibly lewd, pornographic, and perverted. It comes across purely obnoxious, as if she’s begging to get a reaction out of the reader. There wasn't any need to describe Mr. Soaphead’s sexual encounters with the little girls he's molested, in the detail that Toni did. The readers didn't need to know that he had nibbled the nipples (or ""tits"" as Toni vulgarly described) of prepubescent girls, and 'played with their vulvas while they were eating ice-cream'. We get it, he abuses little girls. If you want to create a monster, you can talk about his lusts for children, and only notify the readers that he has indeed abused little girls before, but you do not have to turn your novel into explicit erotica for pedophiles. It makes the readers question where your mind is. Especially when not only can you write things this incredibly filthy, but you also goes as far to do the worse/disgusting thing you can possibly do when discussing rape/molestation, by insinuating that the little girls welcomed the the rape and molestation. Yes, Toni Morrison did this. 
 “The little girls are the only things I’ll miss. Do you know that when I touched their sturdy little t*ts and bit them—just a little—I felt I was being friendly?—If I’d been hurting them, would they have come back? . . . they’d eat ice cream with their legs open while I played with them. It was like a party.”
The RAPE scene involving Cholly and his daughter was over the top, vulgar, disgusting and furthermore downright disturbing. 
""“A bolt of desire ran down his genitals…and softening the lips of his anus. . . . He wanted to f*ck her—tenderly. But the tenderness would not hold. The tightness of her vagina was more than he could bear. His soul seemed to slip down his guts and fly out into her, and the gigantic thrust he made into her then provoked the only sound she made. Removing himself from her was so painful to him he cut it short and snatched his genitals out of the dry harbor of her vagina. She appeared to have fainted""
 Again I repeat- THIS IS HER DESCRIPTION OF A MAN RAPING HIS DAUGHTER. What is this? Child Porn??? What is the point of describing incestuous rape of a frightened eleven year old girl by her father, as ‘tender’? Why is she laboring over the details of a child’s genitalia and sexual responses? Does she honestly believe this a appropriate description of a child being raped by her father? The long-winded sex description between Mr. Cholly and Pauline was also unnecessary, but it would have been forgivable it hadn't been for this line:  ""I knew he wanted for me to come first.."" Again, vulgar much? To make it worse, no one referred to orgasming as ""coming"" in the early 19th century. Seriously, Toni....Re-explaining the situation with Cholly being caught having sex with his cousin's friend, while whites stood watching and telling him ""give it to her harder"", was pointless. Toni had already summarized how this had happened earlier in the book. What was the point of re-explaining it, especially when the event wasn’t that significant? Additionally, what was the significance spending an entire page and a half explaining how a unimportant side character had never experienced a orgasm, when this character only role in the protagonist's life is warding her away and calling her a ""bitch"" for 'killing' her pet? It seemed throughout all of the book Toni went into the most detail explaining the sex between the characters, and priests ""nibbling on the nipples of little girls"", more than the actual development of these characters. No offense to her, but they aren't relatable , interesting, or believable.They're blank slates in strange sexual situations, none more. None of them had their own personalities, or their own faces.Problem #2: The way Toni rationalizes her characters' behavior doesn't make sense on any logical basis, whatsoever. This makes her story seem very fake, forced and unbelievable.... A great example of how unbelievable and irrational the motives of her characters are is Cholly's backstory on why he ended up molesting his daughter. Cholly has issues with his broken family and was disowned by his father (like millions of people around the world) and somehow is so socially inept that he can't love his daughter without raping her? Why? How on earth does that make any sense? So many people are raised by relatives and they don’t think raping children. That said, Toni wrote that he had a relationship with a man named Blue, and he was mothered by his great-aunt until she passed away when he was thirteen. Then, he was raised by her brother. That he was loved and protected by these people who raised him. How does being adopted by loving family members, justify raping his kids, because he 'doesn't know better'? how? Especially since he was not molested by any of his caregivers. Where is he getting the idea that forcing himself on his screaming daughter as genuinely being ok? What examples has he learned this behavior from and why isn't that explained in the novel? Toni said that he was a drunkard, so wouldn't it make more sense to write that he was drunk and perhaps confused his daughter for his wife? For a greater example of how the motivations of the characters do not make sense, is the book premise itself; the main theme doesn't even make sense. Pecola is having issues with society but blames it on her eye color. Ok, I understand her mother treats the little white children she nannies better than her, and I also understand her issues at school and society is because she is dark-skinned therefore perceived ugly. So then would her problem be her dark complexion, and not her eye color? It would make sense if the children her mother nannies had blue eyes, but that was never explained or established in the book, so what the heck? Repeatedly the attention is thrown on the fact that she's black-skinned. So where do the eye part comes from? Am I missing something here? There is the argument that her eye color is suppose symbolize European standards of beauty, but honestly, I cannot agree. The 'symbolism' seems artificially generated by the author herself, and forced into the culture of her novel's fictional world. Most indigenous societies and the black community itself corrupted by colonialism and European culture, simply desire lighter complexion and silky hair, not specifically 'blue eyes'. Green eyes, and brown eyes are also considered beautiful. I could imagine how this book would fit well into the logic of the protagonist's issues, if the book had focused (as the rest of the book did) on her skin color. This leads me into the next issue...Problem #3: Unused and wasted opportunity in character use, and plot development. Makes for a pointless underachieving story- Regarding the protagonist's circumstance and her particular time in American history, I could imagine Toni taking this opportunity to muddle in actual culture examples of forced European beauty standards in American society, by incorporating actual white-centric advertisements of the time, actual white actresses who were considered beautiful at the time, and light-skinned black actresses who were also considered beautiful at the time. She could've somehow relate this and point this out with classic American literature forced on Children, like blonde Cinderella or ""white as snow"" Sleeping Beauty, and make the protagonist fall into self-loathe by these permanent aspects of princess culture. Pecola could've been desirable and beautiful but rejected for her skin color perhaps? The housewife could be a woman who bleached her skin and somehow resented the protagonist because she reminded her of her former self? Claudia could hate the protagonist because she was beautiful regardless of her dark complexion? The priest could've offered Pecola skin bleaching skin, and Picola could've fallen mentally ill due to some accident due to her excitement of being white. Toni have discussed and incorporated the racist cartoons of the time, that described black children (especially dark skinned children) as ugly buck-toothed big-lipped 'pickaninnies'. Toni could have also incorporated the 'paper bag' test, could have gone on about how the 'hair' culture, among black mothers. And how coarser hair is considered 'ugly'.  It would have also been more historical sound illustration of the beauty standards of the time, and address the actual desperation of black/dark women around the world to be perceived as 'beautiful'  Conclusion Phonetically this book well-written and has a pleasing flow, but plot wise, there were plot-holes, unnecessary characters who added absolutely nothing to the development of the plot, and filthy explicit unnecessary sexual scenes that additionally added nothing to development of the plot. The theme was loosely about colorism. I read maybe 2 chapters that solidly built on the racial themes, but the rest was merely short stories about unrelated characters. Even Pauline (the mother) herself, only favored the white children she cared for, more than her actual children because of issues with their father, not because they were black. There was so SO many things Toni could have done with this storyline that was ultimately wasted. Instead she dove much deeper talking about how ""Cholly's anus lips had softened at the sight of his daughter"".  I just.... I don't understand how this book became a beloved classic and won a Nobel Prize. Was it out of political correctness? And wanting to seem 'progressive' by praising any piece of black work that talks about controversial issues? I'm black and I can honestly say this was a disturbing, poorly put together, grotesque book and did absolutely nothing for me but question if the author was secretly a pedophile. It baffles me how many black people praise this, simply because the author is black herself. Its substandard in comparison to other lesser-known black novels that I've read. And I am beyond shock there are people out there who think this is appropriate for middle school and high school kids. YES this book SHOULD have been banned from high schools!! It is not ""To Kill A Mocking Bird"", folks. For a lot of this book, this book is unnecessary porn, and images that young impressionable teens shouldn't have in their minds! If you want a good book about colorism, I recommend ""The Skin I'm In"".Show more"

Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion.”  Toni Morrison,  The Bluest EyeI have several reading goals for 2019 ~~ get some big books off my Want to Read list, explore more Asian writing, and visit authors I have missed along my reading journey. One of the most glaring omissions on this list was Toni Morrison. So, with the advice of my friend, Rowena, I selected THE BLUEST EYE to right that wrong. I am wowed by Morrison's writing talents. I wish I'd have ventured to her world sooner.THE BLUEST EYE may well be the saddest book I have ever read. Upon finishing this novel I felt like I'd been sucker punched. The events that took place in this world were devastating. Morrisson's novel is as far from the childhood world Ray Bradbury created in Dandelion Wine as imaginable. Both took place in the Midwest in the late 20's / early 30's, and focus on childhood. This, is where the similarities end.As painful as this book is to read at times, it is a beautifully written novel. Morrison is a poet at heart.The story is told by a minor character, Claudia, a young girl and friend of Pecola’s; her innocence offers a rawness to the story that would have been lost if narrated by Pecola or an older character. Morrison brilliantly uses the passing of the seasons to tell this story. Each season take place in a different time period and follows a different character in her or his life; we learn the back stories of Pecola's people through this. In the final pages of this book, we see how all these people make up parts of Pecola’s story. Morrison writes of race better than any other writer I can think of. She touches not on race in general, but writes about various themes regarding race here, the central theme being that Pecola’s desire for blue eyes is showing the social context that views blue eyes, which in this case is the epitome of whiteness, as the standard of beauty. Every girl black or white should strive to be like Shirley Temple. Morrison also deftly writes on parenting and family dynamics. When Claudia faces an unwanted event in her home, her parents act swiftly to protect their daughter. When a far more tragic event happens to Pecola, her mother beats and blames her. The main theme of THE BLUEST EYE is not simply racism, but internalized racism. The main characters in Morrison's novel have been conditioned to believe in their own inferiority. No one suffers this more than Pecola. Even members of her own race put her down for being ugly and for the darkness of her skin.In the end, Morrison forces us to walk in Pecola's shoes and learn of the painful world she inhabits, and she does so brilliantly.Show more"

Morrison, a single mother of two sons, wrote the novel while she taught at Howard University. The novel is set in 1941 and centers around the life of a young African-American girl named Pecola who grows up during the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio. Due to Pecola's harsh characteristics and dark skin, she is consistently regarded as ""ugly"". As a result, she develops an inferiority complex, which fuels her desire for the blue eyes she equates with ""whiteness"". The point of view of the novel switches between the perspective of Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of Pecola's foster parents, and a third-person narrator with inset narratives in the first person. Due to controversial topics in the book including racism, incest, and child molestation, there have been numerous attempts to ban it from schools and libraries.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه سپتامبر سال2008میلادیعنوان: آبی ترين چشم؛ نویسنده: تونی موریسون؛ مترجم: نیلوفر شیدمهر؛ علی آذرنگ (جباری)؛ تهران، دریچه، سال1385؛ در264ص؛ شابک9648072043؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20معنوان: آبی ترين چشم؛ نویسنده: تونی موریسون؛ مترجم: کیومرث پارسای؛ تهران، نشر علم، سال1385؛ در310ص؛ شابک96484056205؛ هشدار برای آنها که کتاب را هنوز نخوانده اند، اگر میخواهید کتاب را بخوانید لطفا سطرهای پایانی این نوشتار را نخوانید ...؛ راوی داستان، دخترکی با صداقت، و صمیمیت کودکان نابالغ است؛ زندگی خانواده‌ ی «بریدلاو»؛ شخصیت محوری اصلی اثر: «پکولا بریدلاو»، از همین خانواده ‌ی محروم و آواره سر درمیآورد؛ «پکولا بریدلاو»، دختری است که به تازگی دوران بلوغ را تجربه کرده، او در خانواده ‌ای با نگرش‌ها، رفتارها، و کردارهای پر از تضاد، چشم به جهان گشوده، که اعضای آن تنها در هم‌نژاد بودن و هم‌خانواده بودن اشتراک دارند؛ اعضای خانواده، ستمی دوگانه ـ از سوی نژاد برتر و پدر خانواده ـ را بر دوش خود همواره احساس می‌کنند؛ و این ستم را بیش از همه پیکر نحیف و بی‌گناه «پکولا»، دختر نوجوان بی‌دفاع، تحمل میکند؛ پدر، یک‌بار خانه را آتش میزند، و افراد خانواده را آواره و بیخانمان میکند؛ یک‌بار نیز، دنیایی از درد و رنج را بر سر دختر بیچاره ی خویش، آوار میکند؛ دختر با آرزویی بزرگ در دل؛ اینکه چشمانی آبی، هم‌چون دخترکان سفیدپوست داشته باشد، زنده میماند؛ او آبیترین چشمان دنیا را میخواهد؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 10/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 10/10/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانیShow more"

Colored people were neat and quiet; niggers were dirty and loud...The line between colored and nigger was not always clear; subtle and telltale signs threatened to erode it, and the watch had to be constant.While I was not the biggest fan of Morrison's style in this novel, I did fully appreciate the dagger-sharp insight that she brought to the color caste system that is so prevalent in African-American culture, even today. Her dialogue rang so true, I could hear it coming directly out of my mother's mouth, my grandmother's mouth, and those of all of the women who've ever filled our kitchens with raucous communal fun and glum communal tragedy alike. Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel. Shirley Temple, Mary Jane candies, and Jean Harlow hairstyles - you'll find the delicacy of all of them here, both in these characters' reality and in metaphor. While the truth and injustices here were often sobering to read, they were filled with too much truth to rightfully deny or turn away from. I could spend hours discussing this novel. I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send. This novel is older than I am, and yet it still rings with such verity, with such biting truth and reality. With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison cut open the existence of both internalized and externalized racism in America and laid it bare and exposed at our feet. For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me.Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book. Anyone who's ever questioned, ""But why can't I say those words when you say them all the time? But why do you still believe that racism exists? Why can't you just get over it - the past is the past?"" should read this book. In fact, just read this book anyway - how about that? :) *****Show more"

I think it's important that books like these exist, because we need to remember that problems like these exist. That being said, I strongly disliked the execution of this story. Nothing in this book inspires hope; it's 100% full of brutality, loss, heartbreak and lots of other heavy and heart-breaking topics, and to be honest, I felt like it was way too overdone. I almost couldn't breathe when reading this because it kept telling about disaster after disaster. I needed a little glimpse of hope somewhere, but I didn't get it. This book is said to be very poetic, and I agree with that. However, once again I felt like it was done in an exaggerated manner. Almost every second sentence had a deeper meaning, and while it was beautiful to read in the beginning, it became too much in the end. Furthermore, Toni Morrison chose to mix together genres and perspectives, and I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters despite what they were going through. I love beautiful prose and stories with serious topics, but I didn't like this one one bit. I had a very hard time getting through the mere 200 pages of ""The Bluest Eye"".

For those of us born into this: how many chances do we get to fuck things up and still come out just fine? An almost infinite amount, apparently. Toni Morrison wants those of us born with that winning life-lotto combo ticket to experience the opposite of that life track in a world that encompasses, in her words, ""the far more tragic and disabling consequences of accepting rejection as legitimate, as self-evident."" Where life begins in pain, in rejection, in constant on-going humiliation and self-loathing. The ego doesn't ever have a chance. The Bluest Eye provides a window into this world - a viewpoint so that a Reader can see it for all of its ugliness and marvel at those, like Morrison, that overcome this environment and become a thing of beauty.If you are white male upper-middle class American - a state senator from Alabama with power and a national audience, why would you want to call for the banning of this book, one you have certainly never read?

This work that Morrison has created: a story of darkness, of hopelessness and of a reality that a white male middle-class American could never come close to understanding is a thing of beauty; the lily that grows in the mound of shit.

This book is not, and I repeat not, for the faint of heart. There were sections that absolutely destroyed me and sections that made my stomach curdle like spoiled milk. Toni Morrison is an author that continues to intimidate me and astonish me all at once. There is much to be said about her talents and gifts as a writer. CW: rape on page, incest, pedophilia, racism, colorism, abandonment/neglect, alcoholism, death of a child, death, domestic abuse, parental emotional and mental abuse.The Bluest Eye is a book that will stay with me for an eternity. It's harsh visuals, it's way of connecting me back to my own generational trauma, it's way of making me reckon with my own experiences as a Black woman is something I will never be able to forget. There aren't enough words to describe the brilliance that is Toni Morrison. Although I typically write pretty in-depth reviews for most books that I read, I'm pretty sure that there isn't anything that I can possibly write that would do this book justice.

During this time of turmoil and strife, I went into this read with a heavy heart and it got oh so much heavier. It was however necessary. There is so much to learn and I thank Ms. Morrison for opening my tear-filled eyes. This novel explores racism, poverty, assault, and so much more. It is a heart-wrenching story about Pecola Breedlove, an African American girl living in Lorain, Ohio in 1941, who desperately wants to be beautiful. Even her schoolmates Freida and Claudia, whose lives aren’t exactly easy, would describe Pecola as ugly. For these African American girls, who are given white dolls, with blond hair and blue eyes, beauty is skewed. Pecola would do anything to have “The Bluest Eye”, to be seen as beautiful. To be loved. For Pecola Breedlove, kind, sweet, lonely, innocent Pecola, recognizes far more than she should at her young age. For Frieda and Claudia, their innocence is slowly taken away bit by bit.  Family, friends, relatives, acquaintances. During this time and place. No one had any idea how their actions were taken. No one stopped to think before they took action. Hate is spewed upon those who did not deserve it. Children. Young girls. Innocents. Simply because of the color of their skin. So many passages in this novel hit home. They gave me pause.., and they made tears runneth over.“Long hours she sat looking in the mirror, trying to discover the secret of the ugliness, the ugliness that made her ignored or despised at school, by teachers and classmates alike.”“And something more. The total absence of human recognition—the glazed separateness. She does not know what keeps his glance suspended.”“She has seen it lurking in the eyes of all white people. So. The distaste must be for her, her blackness.” “All of our waste which we dumped on her and which she absorbed. And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. All of us—all who knew her—felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even her waking dreams we used—to silence our own nightmares. And she let us, and thereby deserved our contempt. We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength”“The Bluest Eye” is a character driven novel that will leave you with a heavy heart. I recommend this for a book club and it includes difficult subject matters. . To the “Pecola’s” and Breonna’s of this world. I am so very sorry. I vow to keep reading and educating myself so that I can do better. Thank you to Toni Morrison for this incredible novel.Published on Goodreads and Instagram on 6.13.20.Show more"

What’s going on here? Is this a case of #mybookshelvestoowhite? Even the solitary James Baldwin novel I read was Giovanni’s Room- it happens to be all about European white people. Well, I think what happened is that I think I thought I already had been exposed to so many fictional representations of black America, from movies and tv - the great films of the late John Singleton, the Hughes Brothers and Spike Lee, plus brilliant tv series Homicide and The Wire and documentaries like 13th and Ken Burns’ documentary Jazz, which neatly brings me to music – no one needs to be told how the popular music of the last 100 years has been propelled forward by the engine of black creativity. So I guess I thought I didn’t need to read these books too. So I thought that might be a little bit lazy, a little bit complacent, and decided to start fixing that with Toni Morrison.It was a good start. This is a tough minded short novel. It contains several scenes of nasty sex including rape. It’s all about black self-loathing, internalized racism, so that’s why right at the beginning there is a grisly excerpt from a book for little white kids all about the lovely things they might encounter :See Jane. She has a red dress. She wants to play. Who will play with Jane? See the cat. It goes meow-meow. See Father. He is big and strong. Father, will you play with Jane?And so on. So, you know, The Bluest Eye is not a happy story. Some will say -another tale of African American woe. And it is, it is. But there was one line which cracked me up. A spiritualist healer type named Soaphead Church gets a visit from a little black girl who asks him to change her eyes from brown to blue. Because blue is beautiful and brown is ugly. He gets mad and sits down to write a formal letter to God. This is how he starts :Dear GodThe purpose of this letter is to familiarize you with facts which either have escaped your notice, or which you have chosen to ignore.How often I have mentally composed such a letter myself! But never found an appropriate postbox.SOME THINGS DON’T CHANGE MUCHThis healer guy Soaphead Church has his own printed cards. They say :If you are overcome with trouble and conditions that are not natural, I can remove them; overcome Spells, Bad Luck, and Evil Influences. Remember, I am a true Spiritualist and a Psychic Reader, born with power, and I will help you. Satisfaction in one visit. … Has the one you love changed? I can tell you why. I will tell you who your enemies and friends are, and if the one you love is true or false. If you are sick, I can show you the way to health. I locate lost and stolen articles.

My friend and I just talked about this Twitter thread (""is he hot or is he just white with a visible jawline and/or blue eyes?"") right before I read The Bluest Eye. Toni Morrison captures this dynamic of internalized racial self-loathing so well. With vivid prose, she interrogates how glorifying white skin and blue eyes harms black girls and turns them against one another. Through developing the main characters of this book, the Breedlove family, in a rich and detailed way, Morrison also investigates the repercussions of intergenerational trauma, rape and incest, and more. My heart hurt so much for these characters even as my mind admired Morrison's skill as a writer. She holds nothing back in her books, and neither should we as we fight to diversify our media and show how all bodies deserve love and respect, not just white ones, thin ones, etc. Highly recommended to Morrison fans and to those who care about societal beauty ideals, race and the family, and the social transmission of trauma and abuse.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45198798-leynes,The Bluest Eye,Rating 5 out of 5,"January 18, 2024",84 likes,0,"The Bluest Eye war das letzte Buch, das ich 2022 beendete. Ich hatte mir in dem Jahr vorgenommen, wieder drei Romane von Morrison zu entdecken. Da ich aber erst im Herbst zu einer ersten Lektüre kam – ich las Tar Baby – wollte ich im Dezember dann wenigstens noch ein Werk schaffen. Ich las The Bluest Eye innerhalb von zwei Tagen, was bei einer Länge von nur 205 Seiten nicht verwunderlich ist; in der Rückschau kommt es mir, aufgrund der Tiefe der Themen, doch etwas schnell vor. Ich hätte mir durchaus mehr Zeit für diesen Roman nehmen können. Eigentlich lese ich Morrisons Werk in chronologischer Reihenfolge; bisher sparte ich The Bluest Eye jedoch aus, da ich es vermeide über den sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern zu lesen. Mir ist dieses Thema einfach zu heftig und obwohl es wichtig ist, möchte ich mich damit eigentlich nicht beschäftigen. Da jedoch mein Interesse, Morrisons Gesamtwerk zu erschließen, größer war, als meine Angst vor diesem Thema, fasste ich mir ein Herz und gab dem Roman eine Chance. Was ich sehr erleichternd fand, ist die Tatsache, dass der Missbrauch nur in einer Szene des Romans explizit geschildert wird, ansonsten gibt es zwar viele Referenzen auf Pecolas Schwangerschaft und die Tatsache, dass der Vater der Täter ist, aber im Großen und Ganzen fand ich den Roman aushaltbar. Ich würde nicht sagen, dass Morrison mit einer besonderen Feinfühligkeit an dieses Thema herangegangen ist, ihre Beschreibungen sind teils schon echt heftig und schroff, aber ich fand diesen eher kahlen und realistischen Blick auf das Thema passend. In der Einführung zu dem Buch, schreibt Morrison: ""In exploring the social and domestic aggression that could cause a child to literally fall apart, I mounted a series of rejections, some routine, some exceptional, some monstrous, all the while trying hard to avoid complicity in the demonization process Pecola was subjected to. That is, I did not want to dehumanize the characters who trashed Pecola and contributed to her collapse. One problem was centering the weight of the novel’s inquiry on so delicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.""Und während ich diesen Ansatz verstehe muss ich dennoch sagen, dass ich Morrisons Charakterisierung von Cholly Breedlove, Pecolas Vater und dann Vergewaltiger, nie ganz nachvollziehen konnte. Ich verstehe, warum Morrison kein Interesse daran hatte, ihn als ein unmenschliches Monster zu karikieren – ich selbst bin immer genervt davon, wenn Autor*innen zu moralisierend und ""on the nose"" sind (da ich mir dann immer denke: ""ja, ich kriege das schon noch selbst hin, einen Vergewaltiger zu verurteilen, das braucht mir der*die Autor*in nicht abzunehmen). Dennoch porträtiert Morrison Cholly fast durchweg als, klar, zerrissenen Schwarzen Mann, der nicht für seine Familie sorgen kann, wie er es gerne möchte, aber dennoch deep down als gute Seele, der als einziger Mensch auf dieser Welt seine Tochter liebt. Das ging für mich dann mit seinem späteren unverzeihlichen Gewaltakt überhaupt nicht zusammen. Ich habe mich bisher nicht mit der Psychologie von Sexualstraftäter*innen beschäftigt, aber Cholly ist für mich ein Charakter, der nicht plausibel ist – ich nehme Morrison nicht ab, dass es einen Mann, wie ihn gibt. Doch fangen wir vielleicht lieber von vorne an:
Quiet as it’s kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father’s baby that the marigolds did not grow. A little examination and much less melancholy would have proved to us that our seeds were not the only ones that did not sprout; nobody’s did.We had dropped our seeds in our own little plot of black dirt just as Pecola’s father had dropped his seeds in his own plot of black dirt. Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. What is clear now is that of all of that hope, fear, lust, love, and grief, nothing remains but Pecola and the unyielding earth. Cholly Breedlove is dead; our innocence too. The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too. There is really nothing more to say—except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.
So lauten die ersten Zeilen des Romans. Sie stammen von Claudia, einer Schulfreundin Pecolas. Die Handlung spielt in Lorain, Ohio, wo Morrison selbst 1932 geboren wurde, und handelt von dem Schwarzen Mädchen Pecola Breedlove, das sich nichts sehnlicher als blaue Augen wünscht, weil es hofft, dann von der eigenen Mutter geliebt zu werden. Pauline Breedlove dient der weißen Familie Fisher als Hausmädchen. Um deren kleine blauäugige Tochter kümmert sie sich rührend. Zu Hause muss sie Waschwasser in Eimern auf dem Herd erhitzen. Bei Familie Fisher badet sie das Kind dagegen in einer Porzellanwanne mit silbrigen Wasserhähnen und reibt es danach mit flauschigen Handtüchern trocken. Bei den Fishers findet Pauline in ihrer untergeordneten Rolle ""Macht, Lob und Anerkennung"". Für ihre eigene Familie hat sie (verständlicherweise) nach den langen, harten Arbeitstagen keine Energie mehr übrig. Cholly ist ständig betrunken und verprügelt Pauline. In diesem Umfeld ohne Liebe bzw. Zuneigung wächst Pecola mit ihrem Bruder Sammy auf. Morrison erzählt die Geschichte aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven und bringt uns alle Charaktere nahe. So erfahren wir, dass auch Cholly eine schwere Kindheit hatte. Als er vier Tage alt war, wickelte ihn seine Mutter in zwei Decken und eine Zeitung und setzte ihn auf einem Müllhaufen aus. Seine Großtante Jimmy beobachtete ihre Nichte, rettete ihn und zog ihn auf. Sein eigener Vater schickte ihn zum Teufel. In seinen Jugendjahren wird Cholly bei seinem ersten Mal von zwei Weißen beobachtet, die ihn dann zwingen für sie den sexuellen Akt nochmal zu performen. Diese Demütigung scheint Cholly nie überwunden zu haben. In der Beziehung zu Pauline fand er keine Zuflucht, sondern nur einen Käfig. Er trinkt und schlägt sie. Sie übernimmt die volle Verantwortung (und Anerkennung) als Brotverdiener der Familie. Morrison schreibt über diese Dynamik: ""If Cholly had stopped drinking, she would never have forgiven Jesus. She needed Cholly’s sins desperately."" und ""Holding Cholly as a model of sin and failure, she bore him like a crown of thorns, and her children like a cross."" Die Eheleute scheinen in diesem toxischen Geflecht, das sich gegenseitig füttert, gefangen. Und schließlich begeht Cholly den unverzeihlichen Akt und vergewaltigt seine elfjährige Tochter. Das Baby kommt zu früh zur Welt und lebt nur kurz. Auch Cholly stirbt. Und Pecola wird verrückt. Erst der Wahnsinn schützt sie vor den anderen Menschen.In der Einführung schreibt Morrison: ""When I began writing The Bluest Eye, I was interested in something else. Not resistance to the contempt of others, ways to deflect it, but the far more tragic and disabling consequences of accepting rejection as legitimate, as self-evident. … there are some who collapse, silently, anonymously, with no voice to express or acknowledge it. They are invisible."" Und das hat Morrison mit diesem Roman geschafft. Es ist kein Meisterwerk geworden. Nicht verwunderlich, schließlich ist es ihr Debut. Und im Vergleich zu ihren späteren Werken weist The Bluest Eye definitiv Schwächen auf, aus denen Morrison später lernte. Sie selbst fand die Struktur des Romans im Nachhinein nicht gelungen. Und da würde ich ihr Recht geben. Die unterschiedlichen Perspektiven, auktorial, wenn es um die Breedloves geht, erste Person, wenn Claudias Sicht geschildert wird, sind unterschiedlich stark.Claudia war mein Lieblingscharakter, ist vielleicht sogar my all-time fave, wenn es um Charaktere von Toni Morrison geht. Ich habe sie einfach geliebt. Ihre Naivität, ihre Gutherzigkeit, den Humor und die Leichtigkeit (und gleichzeitig auch Traurigkeit), die sie in die Geschichte gebracht hat. Was hätte ich dafür gegeben, den Roman komplett aus ihrer Perspektive zu lesen. Noch mehr über sie und ihre Schwester Frieda zu erfahren, über ihre komplizierte Freundschaft mit Pecola, ihre unsortierten Gefühle zu Pecolas Schwangerschaft.
Our astonishment was short-lived, for it gave way to a curious kind of defensive shame; we were embarrassed for Pecola, hurt for her, and finally we just felt sorry for her. Our sorrow drove out all thoughts of the new bicycle. And I believe our sorrow was the more intense because nobody else seemed to share it. They were disgusted, amused, shocked, outraged, or even excited by the story. … More strongly than my fondness for Pecola, I felt a need for someone to want the black baby to live—just to counteract the universal love of white baby dolls, Shirley Temples, and Maureen Peals. And Frieda must have felt the same thing.
Claudia ist der stärkere/passendere Charaktere für diese Geschichte. Pecola ist zu passiv, zu sehr ""Opfer"", als dass man als Leser*in nicht an Mitleid zu ihr erstickt. Morrison wollte es vermeiden, dass ihre Leser*innen zu viel Mitgefühl mit Pecola empfinden, aber es ist unmöglich bei diesem hilflosen jungen Mädchen, dass sich selbst und ihr Aussehen hasst und dann noch sexuellen Missbrauch erfährt. Wie kein Mitgefühl haben? Über Claudia als Mittlerin der Geschichte gewänne man den nötigen Abstand, um die Geschichte etwas mehr aus der Ferne zu betrachten. Und gleichzeitig ist Claudia selbst auch ein toller und faszinierender Charakter. Auch sie kämpft ihre Kämpfe. Es ist sehr passend, dass der Roman mit ihrer Perspektive anfängt und endet: ""We saw her sometimes. Frieda and I—after the baby came too soon and died. We tried to see her without looking at her, and never, never went near. Not because she was absurd, or repulsive, or because we were frightened, but because we had failed her. Our flowers never grew. … All of our waste which we dumped on her and which she absorbed. And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. … And fantasy it was, for we were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good, but well behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life. … I even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year. This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live. We are wrong, of course, but it doesn’t matter. It’s too late.""Abschließend bleibt zu sagen, dass Morrison in The Bluest Eye vieles ""falsch"" macht. Viel zu viel Exposition, die Themen (und teils auch wie sie zu interpretieren sind) werden einem auf dem Silbertablett serviert, viel ""telling"", wenig ""showing"", unschlüssige Charakterzeichnung bei Cholly, gänzlich sinnlose Charaktere für die Geschichte (bspw. Soaphead – einfach nur why? was sollte dann auch noch dieser ellenlange Brief?), zu viele POVs etc. etc. – Und dennoch ist es ein gelungenes Debut. The Bluest Eye ist ein Roman, der unter die Haut geht. Ich habe gelacht (cue the scene where Frieda and Claudia find out about Pecola's first menstruation: ""She was ministratin'"") und geweint. Morrisons Stil ist unverkennbar. Sie zieht einen direkt in ihre Geschichten rein. Sie zwingt einen hinzuschauen, nicht nur auf die schönen, sondern auch auf die hässlichen Dinge des Lebens. Und sie macht Platz. Für Schwarze Stimmen, Schwarze Perspektiven. Keine hat dem Platz im Kanon so sehr verdient, wie sie.Show more"

Fervently, for a year she had prayed. Although somewhat discouraged, she was not without hope. To have something as wonderful as that happen would take a long, long time. Thrown, in this way, into the binding conviction that only a miracle could relieve her, she would never know her beauty. She would see only what there was to see. The eyes of other people.

 Meet Pecola Breedlove, never had a figure cut quite so tragic since the Russians discovered crime. Pecola was inspired by Morrison's childhood encounter with a friend who wanted blue eyes... Blue eyes to help her escape the shackles of blackness. Of ugliness. Morrison, at the time, was offended. Angry. The same is carried through in Claudia's narration. The Bluest Eye poster from The Aurora Theatre CompanyUnlike Pecola, Claudia is contemptuous of whiteness. 
I destroyed white baby dolls. But the dismembering of dolls was not the true horror. The truly horrifying thing was the transference of the same impulses to little white girls. The indifference with which I could have axed them was shaken only by my desire to do so.
 Whiteness was responsible for so much suffering of our characters that even those predisposed to despise them would eventually learn to. It was an inevitability. When a teenage Cholly (Pecola's father), is happened upon while making love to a girl in a field by white men, they land their flashlight on him and force him to finish. Make it a good show for them. 
They were big, white, armed me. He was small, black, helpless. His subconscious knew what his conscious mind did not guess—that hating them would have consumed him, burned him up like a piece of soft coal.
 So it comes as a bit of a surprise that Pecola wants proximity to this thing of evil. It's understandable that it's surprising. Claudia has seen how white people and even light skin black people dehumanize them. Mistreat them. But for Pecola, who has been isolated for her ugliness, whiteness, or its pinnacle—blue eyes—means she's no longer invisible. Often times she found herself dismissed for she was small, black and ugly. When she goes to a candy shop to buy Mary Janes, which have a picture of a woman with blue eyes, Pecola is all too aware of how the white immigrant owner can't see her. He looked at her with the total absence of human recognition—the glazed separateness. Morrison goes on to tell us that Pecola has seen interest, disgust, even anger in grown male eyes. And the vacuum isn't new for her. There was distaste in the white gaze for black people. For Pecola, blackness is static and dread. And it is the blackness that accounts for, that creates, the vacuum edged with distaste in white eyes. Perhaps, the saddest thing of it all is that in all things, all Pecola knows is desire. Yearning. No one ever tries to grant her heart's wishes. Or basic needs. Except the three sex workers who are their neighbours. Their openness with Pecola is charming. Morrison has an ear for interaction. You feel as though a part of the few moments of Pecola's joy. But soon you're reminded that Pecola's lot is misery. If she rolled a dice, they would vanish into thin air. Her own mother despised her and not for a lack of trying. Her father loved her in the worst way a father could show his love. The story ends having given a magnified glimpse of this small Ohio town. The story had a feel of a comic book panel. Each displaying a vignette of the few people pivotal to Pecola's wish for blue eyes. I had hoped for more of each of them. That's a personal preference for long winding lingering tales. This book may not need one, but I don't see how it would ever be a bad thing for the world to get more of Morrison. Ultimately, this is a story that centres blackness. The ugliness of blackness. How we can be thoughtless of our own and neglectful of the most vulnerable. The glee with which women crowed and cawed at the misfortune of a little girl is too familiar. The faces have changed but the behaviours are still the same. And our girls shouldn't need blue eyes to feel seen.

This, to me, becomes the metaphor. Then I’ll conclude with the second update I posted:*The first twigs are thin, green, and supple. They bend into a complete circle, but will not break. Their delicate, showy hopefulness shooting from forsythia and lilac bushes meant only a change in whipping style.

As the author herself states in the afterward, ""...this is a terrible story about things one would rather not know anything about."" But at the same time, the story is engrossing, I found the back stories interesting, and really fell in love with the three little girls. Though some of the varying voices that tell their stories don't flow as well in telling their story, the character development is really amazing. The point of view through innocence in the girls makes the horrors and injustices all the more...horrific and upsetting. This book evoked strong emotions in me, which, according to the author, was the point. She did that job well. I feel a strong sense of loss, disgust, revoltion, sadness, and frustration at not knowing how to ""fix"" things. So how do you rate that?Show more"

I have no recollection of how beautifully it was written, how realistic, how revolutionary, how timeless. I don’t recall being knocked out by the dialogue, loving Claudia’s rebelliousness, her rejection of white skinned dolls. ( I rejected dolls with blonde hair.) How could I have forgotten the three prostitutes, their humor and their willingness to accept and not judge?I can add nothing to the wonderful and insightful reviews that have been written over the years. I have gleaned so much more by reading this again. I am resolved to reread all the other Morrison books I read years ago.

I dreaded picking this book up every time i put it down, because it was tiring having to prepare myself for trauma. The Bluest Eye is set in 1940-41 (The Great Depression) and the story is about 11 year Pecola Breedlove who prays that she will get blue eyes so she can finally be considered as beautiful in western society eyes. But Pecola is about to face a plentiful of adversity in her young life. This book is much more than a dark skin girl wanting to have blue eyes. In Morrison's on words she wanted to remind her readers “how hurtful a certain kind of internecine racism is.” The Bluest eye is in part a true story as Morrison had a friend who also wanted to have blue eyes. Morrison observed that her friend was going through 'self racial loathing' and wondered how ""her friend had internalized society’s racist beauty standards at such a young age.I cant say i enjoyed this, because this is not a book to entertain, but more of a book to learn/understand from. This is lyrical literature at its finest and admittedly i did struggle and would have to go back and read certain sentences again to try and depict what the author was trying to express/convey. I was left confused at times because of the back and forth of first person/ third person narrative but eventually got the gist after a while. Although i appreciated Claudia's narrative, i would have liked if the book had been told from Pecola herself. I don't need to pick this book back up and re read because its altered my brain chemistry and will linger in my conscious for many years to come.

All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” Toni Morrison's debut novel is for me a fitting illustration of the truth behind the Hemingway quote above. A painful, uncomfortable, provocative, depressing story that is nevertheless more honest and real than most of the books I've read this year. In a foreword written two decades after first publication, the author expresses some misgivings about the structure of the novel and about how Pecola, the main character, may be lacking in relevance for larger issues of racial identity, her story too particular to lend itself well to generalities. For me, like in the case of Carson McCullers, these flaws in execution may be the very things that convinced me of the sincerity of the feelings described, and the idiom flavored prose more expressive and authentic than later, more polished books (I'm thinking of  Home  , the only Morrison book I've read before this one).The main theme, that of self-esteem, identity and prejudice, is as relevant today as it was in 1941 (when the action is placed) or in 1965 (when the book was first published). Only last week I've read in the news about a shameful Fox News debacle on the colour of Father Christmas (and of Jesus) skin. Why can't we have a black Santa? Why would it be considered ugly? an abomination? The standards of beauty imposed by fashion magazines and MTV shows may be more inclusive today in terms of skin colour, but they remain as radical and as dangerous for children and teenagers who are not tall, skinny, 'blue eyed'. Don't even start me on Miley Cyrus as a role model ...Back to Pecola Breedlove:  a little black girl who wanted to rise up out of the pit of her blackness and see the world with blue eyes. . The whole world is telling her she is ugly, worthless, pityful, and Pecola is not strong enough to contradict it and to fight for herself. It is the artist role to be her advocate, to feel her pain, her despair, and to shout it out for all to hear :  ... there are some who collapse, silently, anonimously, with no voice to express or acknowledge it. They are invisible. The death of self-esteem can occur quickly, easily in children, before their ego has 'legs', so to speak. Couple the vulnerability of youth with indifferent parents, dismissive adults, and a world, which, in its language, laws, and images, re-enforces despair, and the journey to destruction is sealed.  says Morrison in the foreword. I have seen this credo of the artist as the burning, bleeding conscience of his/her generation before (Samuel R Delany comes to mind) but rarely with such intensity and clarity as in the case of Toni Morrison.The story of Pecola reads more like a parable than a reportage, with the outcome made clear right from the start, extensive use of metaphoric language and a fatalistic inevitability that harks back to the Greek tragedies. Most of the novel is told through the eyes of Frieda and Claudia, two black girls growing up in Larain, Ohio in 1941, witnessing the drama unfolding in the Breedlove family, fighting spirits both but yet too young to be able to do anything about their friend. They plant some flower seeds in the barren earth of their neighborhood (marigolds as a symbol for love and understanding?), but their good intentions amount to nothing: Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. What is clear now is that of all that hope, fear, lust, love, and grief, nothing remains but Pecola and the unyielding earth. Cholly Breedlove is dead; our innocence too. The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too. There is really nothing more to say - except why. But since 'why' is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in 'how'. The following account is non-linear, broken in pieces, jumping back and forth in the timeline and moving around to other locations, passed through from one character to another in an almost haphazard manner, yet coming round by the finish line to Pecole and the marigolds refusing to bloom. Many factors contribute to the little girl's downfall, yet the lion's share of blame should probably be placed firmly at her parents door: Pauline and Cholly Breedlove have a disfunctional relationship that hurts their children more than their own calloused and already defeated souls. Polly takes refuge in the fantasy world of cinema and believes her children should conform to the burgeois standards of the white class: Into her son she beat a loud desire to run away, and into her daughter she beat a fear of growing up, fear of other people, fear of life.Cholly is a drunkard who keeps everything inside, unable to express himself other than though violence, regularly beating his wife and terorizing the children. He pities his daughter, but the way he chooses to manifest his emotion is more than horrible. Another abuser is a certain Whitcomb, an Anglophile mullato con man and a pervert who poses as a priest and a dream interpreter. Pecola finds more understanding and kindness in the rooms of destitute whores living in the apartment above than in her own family. What is interesting about all the adults in the story is that behind all their despicable actions, they are not actually corrupted in their own eyes. Pauline was at one time happy in her house chores and even in her passion for Cholly. Cholly was once a free spirit, a fighter and a tender husband. Whitcomb believes he is doing a service to the community, even to the underage girls he fondles. They all find some way to rationalize their failures. The autor goes to great lengths to show their human frailty instead of condemning them outright, leaving the task of moral judgement on the shoulders of the reader: Have I looked down instinctively on someone on account of their race (Romanian Gypsies are quite horribly treated today both in Romania and in Europe)? Have I judged people hastily, without trying to walk some miles in their shoes? Maybe. Will I do it again, after reading this book? Probably: the feelings of euphoria and goodwill tend to evaporate in time under the pressure of mundane preoccupations. But I hope some kernel of truth will remain, and who knows, maybe some marigolds will bloom in my own garden.My final quote is I believe an illustration of the fact that we do not need to be perfect, we need only to make an effort and to keep learning about the world and the people around us, no matter how old we are in years: Love is never better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover's inward eye. Let us love wisely, for once!Thank you, Mrs. Morrison for the remainder.Show more"

It is a deeply affecting story that I will not forget. It's not just a book to be read; it's one to be savoured, studied, and thought about. Each sentence has a purpose and meaning, and I analyzed it all. I questioned it, challenged my thoughts, and searched the internet for answers. It's a fascinating and rewarding study of socially constructed ideas of how we see the beauty and ugliness of the world and the people in it. How racism has shaped those ideas and how that can harm one's self-worth.To escape from the ugliness of her world, Pecola, whose only sin is being ugly and dirty(black and poor), prays for blue eyes to see the world differently. She thinks by having blue eyes, people will treat her differently and see her as beautiful. How does a young girl learn to hate herself and carry such a burden before she is old enough to find out who she is and where she fits in?The story is not about a young black girl raped by her father, that is the story's climax. The story is about why and how ""But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how."" ~Claudia. It was difficult to handle, but I did take refuge in the how by the novel's end. Toni Morrison ""hits the raw nerve of racial self-contempt and exposes it"" She hits on that nerve by showing us how a black community's learned self-hatred for being black contributes to the undoing of a young black girl. She makes a statement about that damage by focusing on ""how something as grotesque as the demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child: the most vulnerable member: a female."" ~Morrison. Pecola's tragedy comes from a crippled and crippling family and community who can not be dehumanized or smashed because their self-hatred is embedded in their history of being treated as lesser and unworthy. Even though the story centers around Pecola, we are told the story by the POV of young Claudia and adult Claudia as she reflects back on the how. We also see into characters who represent black women who have learned to hate their blackness and try to hide it, from Claudia's mother, Pauline, who sees herself in Pecola and has learned to love beauty and cleanness (whiteness and wealth) and hate blackness, and from her father, Cholly who lost his tenderness by being treated like trash.""Abandoned in a junk heap by his mother, rejected for a crap game by his father, there was nothing more to lose."" ~ChollyClaudia is the opposite of Pecola. She is from a caring black family, innocent, and has not yet learned the self-hatred that plagues Pecola and the community in the story. We also see into learned hate through characters representing race, class, and beauty. Pecola is not a character to fall into the comfort of pitying, feeling bad for her, or shedding tears for. She is so much more as she represents learned self-hatred that plagues the people around her and symbolizes the black community's crippling self-hatred and belief in their ugliness. Those tears are for all real-life young girls affected by the ugliness of that standard of whiteness. In a society where we ignore the truths while rearranging our lies and calling them truths, humanity still contributes to the undoing of the real-life Pecolas. The Bluest Eye has changed me and shaped a more understanding look at the beauty and ugliness of both whiteness and blackness. It is a rewarding and beyond satisfying reading experience that only comes along once in awhile. It will be one I will not forget. Why you should read itThe Bluest Eye is a good one to study it and see the world as it was, as it is, how it has changed and how it could be. We can't have change if we don't see the ugly.Show more"

After all, we are talking a physicality that differs in very few respects from the type idealized by the Nationalist Socialist German Workers' Party, and in the land of the whites and the home of the bleach, that phenotype means power. Just last week, one of my professors commented on her constant well-dressed appearance with ""I can't wash this off,"" scrubbing at her hand as synecdoche for how her African heritage had chosen to display itself. Sixty years ago that choice in clothing was just as politically charged, for to dress well and not be white was an open invitation to getting the living shit beaten out of you. As you can see, the white supremacy is a canny thing, always knowing how to change its skin.Four to five hundred years or so ago, the science of race was invented to excuse the existence of slavery in the face of religious humanity and social equality. Since then, the country of the United States was invented, taught to children as a ""cultural melting pot"" that flenses them from schoolyard to mass media and back again. It is an easy process: bully any who diverge into a morass of self-hatred, let others who are of the flock accessorize with the dehumanized divergence, then commercialize until all that is left of a human heritage is white people consumption. Jazz, Hinduism, bindis, yoga, rap, sushi, greeted with raging disgust and vitriolic hatred unless, of course, you're white. Then by all means, consume away. There's no danger in your representation. Only oppression.It would be allegory if the entire machinery of the US Government didn't single out the chosen sacrifices based on the color of skin and the inheritance of creed, but it does. It would have aged badly if cultural appropriation wasn't an imperialistic practice that takes the existence of others as the latest ""fad"" for a blonde-haired and blue-eyed persona, but it is. I'm talking dark-skinned girls bleaching their skin, I'm talking the violation of civilizations for the pursuit of a hobby, I'm talking a disconnect between an entire host of souls from their bodies that makes the incest in this book ugly and a white man raping his three-year-old daughter legally acceptable in the US as of 2014. Toni Morrison wrote this book while people were killing themselves to keep themselves aligned with ""respectability politics"" of white fashion; today, every white person wants dreadlocks. Shit on something long enough and it's yours for the commercial taking, so long, of course, you look a certain way.If you dehumanize someone because they don't look like blonde-haired blue-eyed white-skinned skinny-assed me, you are utter, fucking, goddamn trash.

Por ejemplo, creo que hay un ferrocarril subterráneo que conecta estos ojos azules con Sobre la belleza de Zadie Smith. Es el concepto del racismo cimentado en la estética dominante, una visión que se formó en Europa con pintores como Rubens y que en el siglo XX fue ampliamente consolidada por el cine y los mass media. Los ojos azules de esta novela son el símbolo de ese racismo estético que conduce al auto-odio a aquellos que margina.Ya nunca fue capaz, tras su educación en las salas de cine, de mirar una cara y no asignarle una determinada categoría en la escala de la belleza absoluta, escala que se regía integramente por las imágenes de la pantalla.Conocemos a Pecola, una adolescente, casi una niña que queda embarazada a raíz de la violación de su propio padre. Se nos relata la historia a través de otras niñas de su edad, que habitan el mismo entorno de miseria y marginación, pero no son tan desafortunadas como ella. Ya las primeras frases del libro nos exponen la situación y todo el resto será un intento de comprender los factores que la han originado:Aunque nadie diga nada, en el otoño de 1941 no hubo caléndulas. Creímos entonces que si las caléndulas no habían crecido era debido a que Pecola iba a tener el bebé de su padre.Pecola sufre la tensión de su familia disfuncional, pero sobre todo sufre por su aspecto, por el rechazo que adivina y no acaba de entender:Todo en ella es fluido y expectante. Salvo su negrura, que es pavorosamente estática. Y es la negrura lo que cuenta, lo que crea aquel vacío con regusto de aversión en los ojos de los blancos.La autora nos relata en detalle las vidas de Pauline y Cholly, los padres de Pecola, para hacernos entender cómo se llega a la situación actual. Con todo ello pinta un cuadro detallado de la marginación social de los años 40 y de la situación de las comunidades negras. En pocas palabras nos describe la situación del matrimonio:Cholly y la señora Breedlove peleaban entre sí con un tenebroso y brutal formulismo sin otro parangón que el de sus apareamientos amorosos. Tácitamente habían convenido en no matarse el uno al otro.Junto con el interés humano y el relato de hechos brutales, el dominio del lenguaje contribuye a hacer de esta novela una lectura apasionante:Era también otoño cuando vino Mr. Henry. Nuestro inquilino. Nuestro huésped. Las palabras salían en globitos de los labios y flotaban en el aire sobre nuestras cabezas: silenciosas, desunidas y gratamente misteriosas.Es muy interesante leer el epílogo, en que la autora cuenta cómo de pequeña una amiga le confió que rezaba para tener los ojos azules:Implícita en su deseo estaba la autoaversión racial. Y veinte años después yo me preguntaba todavía cómo se aprende semejante cosa. ¿Quién se la había inculcado? ¿Quién le había hecho creer que era mejor ser una monstruosidad que lo que era? ¿Quién la había mirado y la había encontrado tan deficiente, tan insignificante en la escala de la belleza? La novela pretende dar un atisbo de la mirada que la condenó.Show more"

Momentarily or for sustained periods of time,” Toni Morrison stated in her author note, as she explained the context of this novel. Imagine a Nobel Laureate reading her work, and then explaining her art. I listened to this via Audible and I was spellbound. Inflections with each character switch and mood, exquisite dialogue performance—I might as well have been in the same room with her.The bluest eye. Oh what great use of personification. This story, laden with historical and literary context, is narrated by young Claudia and follows three black girls: Claudia, Frieda, and Pecola. Raised in small town Ohio following the Great Depression and during a time laced with blatant racism and segregation, let’s just say, the girls were the bearers of grown folks’ wrath. Pecola’s parents are indifferent towards her. She must call her mom, Mrs. Breedlove, while the blonde-haired, blue-eyed little girl her mother takes care of, calls her Polly. When Pecola sees the same mother who beats and yells at her oohing and aahing at the little girl, the blue eyes become her way of wanting to be acknowledged. Maybe if she had blue eyes… Later, the bluest eye will play a role after Pecola goes through a horrific ordeal and we get to hear from her directly.Pauline Breedlove (Pecola’s mother) on the other hand, loves her job as a housekeeper because she gets to escape her life with the abusive husband, poverty, and invisibility. In her world, no one notices or acknowledges her: the black woman. Shopping for her family is a pain. But in her white employers’ world where she must purchase items and make decisions on their behalf, vendors respect her duty and title. At these moments within the story, Claudia’s first person narration veers to a third-person narrator once you start to get into the adults’ heads (like crazy Cholly’s, for example) and more mature issues are raised.Toni Morrison started this story in 1962—working on it while getting her MA. In 1965, it started to take the shape of a book. In elementary school, she had a friend who told her that she wished she had blue eyes. Very blue eyes in a very dark skin? She was repelled by her friend’s desire. With the book she tried to “hit the raw nerve of racial self contempt, expose it, then soothe it.”I’ve never run across an author who writes like Toni Morrison. While reading two of her works simultaneously this week, (I also read Paradise) I noticed her signature style. It’s the good kind of expectation, like buying a Coach purse knowing that there are certain things about it that will not let you down. The lyrical syntax is prolific, the narrator voice oblique, and the story structure will take leaps and bounds. The second half of this book was my favorite. In the beginning, there is a certain voice that pierces the narrative throughout and I wondered what it was (the white house and Jane playing). Towards the end, I understood the art as I heard from Pecola (in a weird, artistic kind of way) and it was a deeply emotional moment. Show more"

I just know it was published post 1993, because it contains the afterward written by Morrison then, in which she proves to be one of her most severe critics. Morrison thought that at the times she lacked the narrative skill to tell the story the way she wanted. I will respectfully disagree, as while Percola's story is terrible in the sense of the almost unrelenting pain & bleakness, it is beautiful with Morrison's gift of language & her ability to create believable characters. Percola's story broke my heart.Percola's belief that she would be beautiful & loved if only she had blue eyes is heartbreaking. Unloved, unwanted & neglected, Percola based her idea of beauty on what she could see - the readers available at school featured white children, dolls were white dolls. Her friend Claudia had a totally different reaction to the white dolls, but Percola lacked the McTeer sisters' toughness &, I would say, certainty of their place in the world. You never get the feeling that the end is going to be anything, but tragic for poor Percola & it is impossible not to be moved by her story.Read with both Women's Classic Literature Enthusiasts Group & the BLK Group June/July Reading Challenge.

Morrison's prose had a calming effect on me--I just wanted her to keep on telling me the story. The only sensation I can think of that feels similar is being at home, warm, wearing soft socks, and snuggled under a blanket. Some parts are difficult to read, as most people are aware, but I never felt she did so distastefully or in too graphic a detail.The story is supposed to be about Pecola Breedlove, but I felt that was oversimplifying it. It was really about the three children's experiences--Claudia, Frieda, and Pecola--as a whole, being poor African-Americans in a mostly white state during segregation.The book is split into 4 parts--Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer--and takes place in Lorain, Ohio in 1940-41. It starts in the main characters' present, with flashbacks throughout, and switches POVs between Claudia MacTeer's 3rd person narrative, and that of an omniscient 3rd person for the flashbacks and stories where Claudia isn't present. This is one of the first things I would've changed. I loved Claudia's voice--the naivete and innocence of it--and I missed it when it wasn't there. Maybe it could've been completely written in Claudia's voice, as a child for the present, and as an adult for the flashbacks and epilogue. It might've even taken some sting out of some of the rougher material, making it easier to get through. Granted it could've been done in the omniscient 3rd party throughout, but I think that would've taken some of the heart out of the tone.I would've also changed the order the flashbacks happen in, and I would've taken Soaphead Church completely out--or reworked him entirely. I probably would've written him as a snake-handling preacher. As is, he was a completely unnecessary character, let alone worthy of as many pages as he was given.I did truly enjoy this, and I feel like I learned a lot about the African-American experience post-slavery but pre-civil rights. I highly recommend picking this up at your local library or bookstore. Trigger warnings for this book should include--rape, child rape, physical, verbal, mental, and emotional abuse, racism, bullying, and animal cruelty.""At least on the edge of my town, among the garbage and the sunflowers of my town, it's much, much, much too late.""*I also listened to this on audiobook and the narrator was wonderful. Her voice paired nicely with the words on the page, helping to add some emotional depth. However, I did notice that she pronounced some things strangely, but I'm not sure if it was wrong, or just a dialectal difference.Show more"

Hurts.I first read Professor Morrison's powerful indictment of how the oppressed can be oppressors in her landmark first novel while I was an undergraduate taking a course on African American literature. Though I had read Song of Solomon, Jazz and Beloved beforehand, this is the Morrison that I found most upsetting and have had a hard time processing because of what whiteness, power and privilege can do to someone’s psyche when seen as less than. It’s completely heartbreaking. I was awed by how her language was biting, coarse, languid and ethereal by reading her unforgettable writing. I was seduced at how shocking and beautiful her words were, so when I became a teacher for the first time in a leave replacement position, I taught this novel to young scholars who were mesmerized and stunned as I was to have read something so bold.Over 20 years later, and after having seen her read live in 2015 and 2019 during the last years of her life, I reread this novel in one sitting. Not only did I feel how electric her language was after all those years, but the context of the book had changed considerably for me, as I had become a high school English teacher that served underprivileged kids. The themes of this novel are as relevant as they were, from the 1930s in which it's set, to the late 1960s, early 1970s on which it was written and published; and even more now- in the complicated and violent world of the post Obama and Trump era, where black lives have been continuously destroyed just for being black and racism is just as horrible and degrading as its always been. However, the story of Pecola Breedlove, an innocent girl whose obsession with whiteness and self hate is something that lives with anyone who's ever felt terrible about themselves. The way townspeople shunned her, made fun of her, and scapegoated her is a cruel metaphor that society is willing to be bystanders acknowledging that awful and racist things happen, especially to the weak and passive. Since Pecola is so down and low in the social hierarchy, her pain and sorrow empower those who scapegoat her. The novel begins with Pecola being sent to live with the McTeer family- sisters Claudia and Frieda who live in strict, but warm family home where under the careful watch of their mother, has taught them to love themselves, especially spunky Claudia, who is confused as to why black isn't beautiful? She asks ""What made people look at them and say, awww, but not for me?"" (Morrison 22). Claudia, unlike Pecola, refuses to conform to the norms of white beauty to the point of having violent thoughts, ""I had only one desire: to dismember it"" (Morrison 20). Claudia and Frieda soon come to realize that its Pecola's inherent acceptance of self hate is why she is victimized so often: she wears it on her sleeve, and even those with the deepest insecurities and self hatred abuse this innocent girl as their physical and sexual punching bag just to make themselves feel bigger. Beginning with the lack of a family support from her mother Pauline, brother Sammy; Pecola is victimized by classmate Maureen, a lonely boy named Junior whose mother has sexual acts with the family cat leading to the horrifying scene where her father Cholly impregnates and rapes her. It's a shattering novel. However, since Professor Morrison writes with so much empathy and backstory to the characters who victimize Pecola- especially her mother and father, we understand and have an empathy to their hideous actions- but we cannot sympathize with the violation of an innocent human being. The Bluest Eye is a haunting, poetic novel that seizes racial self hatred by the horns and examines race as a construct that is both empowering and disheartening. It also asks the question of why is the construct of whiteness and blue eyes more beautiful than being happy with oneself? I asked and reflected on my own experiences as man of color of how whiteness presented itself to me as something I thought about attaining- but quickly realized could never have. As an adult, I couldn't put this novel down, and I remember how powerful Professor Morrison's love and rage was through her writing, and her work is always meant to be revisited from time to time.Show more"

I decided to reread it when my daughter read it for school. I am very grateful that we shared the experience of reading and discussing it together. Scenes that stuck with both of us were the Shirley Temple Cup, the scene with the cat, and Maureen Peals/meringue pie. The Maginot Line is definitely a memorable character.The subject matter is heavy and disturbing. Morrison humanizes those that have historically been dehumanized. Characters we may have a hard time liking (like Pecola’s parents), are seen in a new light as the reader sees the events that have brought them to their current situation. Every character is navigating some form of trauma. Every character searching for something to help them escape their situation. Cholly’s search for his father and Pecola’s request for Soapbox Church were both so very sad. The banter between the sisters and the beautiful prose Morrison composes are like debris from a shipwreck, keeping the reader afloat while witnessing her main character break and get pulled under.

Toni Morrison has a Pulitzer and a Nobel, and she deserves them both.Precious few people can write like she does. Dare I say it, but only a few times in a generation are we lucky enough to have a writer who was born to put pen to paper. I call her a writer and not a novelist or an author because that would be disrespectful to her talent.Unfortunately, there are those who have read this book and act as if Toni Morrison is blaming the entire Caucasian community for the plight of one young African-American girl, and nothing could be further from the truth.This is such a silly idea that it doesn’t even deserve to take up space in this review, but I’m mentioning it because there are people who say they hate this book simply because it is about a little girl who suffers deeply, and all because she happens to be African-American. How unfair to abused children, regardless of their skin color.Maybe these people just don’t get it. Or maybe they’re inbred. I have a friend whom I suspect might be a little inbred, and she’s not racist, so that’s no excuse. No excuse at all.Rather than provide a synopsis, I’ll add this paragraph from The Bluest Eye which sums up perfectly the depth and beautiful sorrow that this book possesses:“All of our waste which we dumped on her and which she absorbed. And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. All of us–all who knew her–felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we has a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even her waking dreams we used–to silence our own nightmares. And she let us, and thereby deserved our contempt. We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength.” -Toni Morrison, The Bluest EyeThat quote is about an 11 year-old girl, so please keep that in mind if you decide to read this. It is intense and you will probably cry. Most people do.I read this book several years ago, and it is so well-written that I find myself remembering vivid details about it all these years later. What a tragic yet poetic story this is, and one that will hopefully capture your heart like it did mine.Show more"

I'm on page 50 and I've already had more than I can take. The symbolism is over the top and heavy-handed to the point that I can't decide whether I'm being shouted at for no reason or insulted as a dull creature incapable of understanding such things unless it is stated outright with excruciating detail. Its insistence on being so obvious with everything makes it sound pretentious, preachy, and annoying. Additionally, the overemphasis the author places on race and its inextricability from the conventional concept of beauty makes it sound like she's ranting. This would be fine in a blog or on Facebook - in the context of a novel it's just obnoxious and completely closes the ear to what the author intends to communicate. While the base idea of the themes is good, that idea is lost in how abused and overused they are within the novel. Again, although I'm only on page 50 I feel like I'm being perpetually beaten in the head with a frying pan. Needless to say, it's really not a pleasant feeling, and I'm frightened that I'm reading this in my Contemporary Literature course.

I did read the whole thing (much to my own dispair. It just didn't drastically change my opinion.I would like to add, though, that again, although I thought the execution could have been better, this book DID open my eyes to the self image issues black girls have about not being white. I didn't know that was a thing they'd struggle with. To me, all shades of black are beautiful in their own ways. I love everything she's trying to get across, and her heart is more than in the right place. And I certainly understand more knowing it was her first novel, which kind of explains a lot. I would definitely be willing to read her more recent books - I'm sure she will have improved a lot since then. Show more"

The Bluest Eye was her first novel and some critics weren't sold on the formatting--Ruby Dee said it wasn't exactly a story but a ""series of painfully accurate impressions."" Years later in the afterward, Morrison herself said the brokenness of the narrative doesn't quite please her. I think there's probably some fairness in that, but it still works as an impressionist novel.The imagery is so powerful, so harrowing, that even if it's sometimes difficult to place the story in a sense of chronology, the emotion pierces through without any trouble. Particularly the ending, which is heart-wrenching. I don't know if it's my favorite Morrison novel, but it's still a masterpiece and possibly her most memorable.

Something I hope to rectify very soon. --ORIGINAL REVIEW -
Each night, without fail, she prayed for blue eyes. Fervently, for a year she had prayed. Although somewhat discouraged, she was not without hope. To have something as wonderful as that happen would take a long, long time.
I had an English teacher who used to tell us to read Russian authors if we wanted to actually appreciate literature, but from my experience, it is Women of Colour whose books have made me appreciate literature more. Perhaps it is because they write with so much heart. Perhaps it is because they write about real world issues. I don't know why it is so, but what I do know is that after I read something by any of them, I feel an overwhelming need to hug someone and cry my eyes out; sometimes out of happiness, sometimes out of sadness, other times, because I just have to. 
You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.
 When I was about twelve years old, I got it into my mind that I was ugly. Now, the reasons for this were of course, very superficial, but I was, after all twelve. And I had been conditioned to believe that some features were considered pretty and some weren't. And the literature said that ideally, my features were not supposed to be pretty. I have never been thin, puberty is the worst time for anyone to learn that. From then, for the next three years, I was obsessed with being thin. Now, I didn't start on a diet or anything, but every time I looked in the mirror, I hated myself. I'm also dark; my skin colour is something I'm very proud of now, but back then, I wanted to be fair. All the advertisements, movies, series...everyone I saw was fair. I've always had long hair, but this being the 2000's fancy short hair cuts were in vogue. And no matter how much I begged my mother, she never let me cut my hair. You see, like most mothers, she saw the beauty in it. But I hated it. I hated not being able to leave my hair open when I went to the mall, I hated that my mother used to oil and braid my hair everyday, I hated that I couldn't style it the way I wanted to. My teeth never fell out on time, so my permanent set is extremely crooked. I hated smiling for photos because I hated my teeth. I also wore thick glasses, because I am extremely short-sighted. All in all, I hated how I looked. I envied the fair girls with short hair and straight, even teeth. I was jealous of those girls who wore the-then trendy rimless glasses. Why? Because conditioning. I think children, especially girls, in general are conditioned from childhood, by various sources that they're supposed to look a certain way. Not looking in that certain way, in many cases, can lead to a serious case of self-loathing. By the time I was fourteen, many of friends had had boyfriends. And again, I hated myself. Because I assumed I was too ugly for any boy to like me. But somehow, I don't really know when, I started finding beauty in the flaws. It was perhaps when someone told me that my skin was very clear (it isn't anymore, but it was, back then). Or perhaps when someone else told me my hair was thick and long and black and looked beautiful. Of course, my then self-esteem didn't let me completely believe them, but I was secretly happy about this. When I was seventeen, I fell in love with someone. Not the teenage-seventeen infatuation, but truly in love. And as luck would have it, this person fell for me as well. I don't really know what he thought about my looks, because at seventeen, you don't discuss that. I did know that he thought I was smart and kind and intelligent. Of course, I was seventeen, so while I didn't believe my mother when she told me this, I believed this boy. Suddenly, I loved myself again. Funny that someone else needed to see good in me to do this, but I did. When I turned eighteen, I went away to college. College was on the other end of the country. And one day, I had a fight with this guy, and we've never spoken since. And yet again, my self esteem hit a new low. And while that fight remains the biggest regret of my life, that's not the point of this story. At this very low point in my life, I met two girls in college; I had a minor falling out with one though we still remain acquaintances, and the other went on to become my best friend. These two girls had everything to do with making me love myself again. They took me to the fanciest parlour in the city, and I was glad they were finally helping me chop my hair off, but they didn't do that. Instead, they made me get a cut that flattered my face, while the length of my hair remained the same. I was perplexed, but like my mother, these girls found beauty in my hair as well. And perhaps this is another form of conditioning, but that haircut changed my life. I suddenly saw myself as beautiful. I learned that being dark or fair didn't matter. I began taking pride in my long hair. Most importantly, I learned that smiling wasn't about showing perfect teeth, it was about showing joy. I learned to smile from my heart, and that, to me, has made all the difference. I also learned to use make up, but that's besides the point. Of course, now, almost twelve years after I started hating how I looked, I've realised that beauty isn't about how you look. But twelve-year old me would've never believed it. Pretty much like how 9-year old Claudia or 11-year old Pecola didn't. 
It was a small step to Shirley Temple. I learned much later to worship her, just as I learned to delight in cleanliness, knowing, even as I learned, that the change was adjustment without improvement.
The reason for this very long, and slightly boring anecdote is that I can understand. When Pecola thinks she's ugly because she doesn't have blue eyes, I can understand. When the Breedloves collectively believe that they're ugly, I can understand. When the writer says that a lot of their ""ugliness"" comes from the conditioning that they believe they're ugly, I can understand that too. That said, I'm not trying to say that I can feel, or understand even a small percentage of what Pecola went through. Or for that matter, the Blacks in that era in general. Disregarded by many of her own fellow-Blacks who thought themselves to be superior, born to a mother who loves a White child more than she loves her own daughter because of her skin colour, scorned by the many Whites that she constantly interacts with, shamed by the boys who share her skin colour but hate her skin colour. Pecola represents a whole slew of people in the Segregation era who were made to feel ugly because of the colour of their skin. Or in this case, the eyes. 
It had occurred to Pecola some time ago that if her eyes, those eyes that held the pictures, and knew the sights—if those eyes of hers were different, that is to say, beautiful, she herself would be different.

Northern colored folk was different too. Dicty-like. No better than whites for meanness. They could make you feel just as no-count, ’cept I didn’t expect it from them.
 What happens when some African-Americans consider themselves to be better than other African-Americans? The answer is fairly simple, that it makes it easier for people outside the community, in this case, Whites, to hate them. While the answer is simple, the consequences of this can be far worse. In a way, this is what happens to Pecola. This is what happens to the Breedloves. Soon, Polly herself begins neglecting her own husband and children for the rich, pretty, White family for whom she keeps house. 
More and more she neglected her house, her children, her man—they were like the afterthoughts one has just before sleep, the early-morning and late-evening edges of her day, the dark edges that made the daily life with the Fishers lighter, more delicate, more lovely.
 Why? Conditioning. 
Pauline kept this order, this beauty, for herself, a private world, and never introduced it into her storefront, or to her children. Them she bent toward respectability, and in so doing taught them fear: fear of being clumsy, fear of being like their father, fear of not being loved by God, fear of madness like Cholly’s mother’s. Into her son she beat a loud desire to run away, and into her daughter she beat a fear of growing up, fear of other people, fear of life.
 Cholly, similarly, also feels contempt for his fellow Blacks, even when together, they become victims of oppression and hate from White men. 
Never did he once consider directing his hatred toward the hunters. Such an emotion would have destroyed him. They were big, white, armed men. He was small, black, helpless. His subconscious knew what his conscious mind did not guess—that hating them would have consumed him, burned him up like a piece of soft coal, leaving only flakes of ash and a question mark of smoke.
The story starts with what is called a ""Dick and Jane tale"", and this particular tale plays a very important role in this story. Morrison uses the excerpts of the tale, that talks about the happy, White family of Dick, Jane, and their parents, while contrasting it with the bleak story of Sammy, Pecola, Pauline and Cholly. These excerpts are written together without spaces, and form the titles of those chapters that are written in the third person perspective. For instance SEETHECATITGOESMEOWMEOWCOMEANDPLAYCOMEPLAYWITHJANETHEKITTENWILLNOTPLAYPLAYPLAYPLA refers to 
See the cat. It goes meow-meow. Come and play. Come play with Jane. The kitten will not play.
 In the Dick and Jane tale, the cat represents the family ideal of a happy pet. In Pecola's tale, however, the cat, or 
a
 cat just manages to further her misery, making her more ostracised and wretched than ever. Similarly, HEREISTHEHOUSEITISGREENANDWHITEITHASAREDDOORITISVERYPRETTYITISVERYPRETTYPRETTYPRETTYP is contrasted with 
Here is the house. It is green and white. It has a red door. It is very pretty.
 Pecola's house isn't pretty; not on the inside, nor on the outside. Her only solace is with three prostitutes, Miss Maginot Line, China, and Poland, who live above Pecola's apartment. This, in a way, makes her residence even more ugly for the rest of the neighbourhood, because who would want to associate with three ""ruined"" women? SEEFATHERHEISBIGANDSTRONGFATHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEFATHERISSMILINGSMILEFATHERSMILESMILE as opposed to 
See Father. He is big and strong. Father, will you play with Jane? Father is smiling. Smile, Father, smile
; a father that rapes Pecola, as opposed to a father that plays with Jane. The Bluest Eye is a very small book, but the wealth of the message it spreads is vast. My mother always said to my brother and I when we were fighting, ""if you don't support your own family, do you think an outsider will?"" The same, I believe, holds true for this story, and its moral. If people of colour discriminate against other people of colour because they believe they are fairer, would a White person really support a person of colour? Of course, in today's world, many would. More than many would. In those times, however, not sticking with your own people could have serious consequences. 
More strongly than my fondness for Pecola, I felt a need for someone to want the black baby to live—just to counteract the universal love of white baby dolls, Shirley Temples, and Maureen Peals.
I'm not saying that Pecola needed someone to get her a life changing haircut. I'm not even saying that calling her beautiful would've helped her or made her story any less appalling. I'm saying that maybe some affection from her mother, or a word of praise could've helped her more than I can imagine.Or maybe if Polly had actually seen herself like her husband initially saw her, if someone had told her that she was still beautiful, she may have been a more loving wife, a more loving mother. May have been. Could have been. But of course, isn't that the point of fiction, the ""could've been"" of it all? This book wrenched out my soul in ways I didn't think was possible. It greatly diminishes most literary experiences I've had in the past year. I know I've written a lot of words about what is one of the smallest books (in size) that I've ever read, but believe me when I tell you, I don't actually have words to tell you how I feel after this book, because everything I say is greatly inadequate to actually convey how I feel. Toni Morrison would've deserved the Nobel for just this book, if this book was all she wrote. 
Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover’s inward eye.
 I guess what remains to be said has already been spoken (or sung) by a very wise man who said, ""all you need is love"". What he forgot to mention, was that love can take many forms; and the kind of love that we need, is the unconditional kind.Show more"

Pero Pécola también pasa desapercibida fuera de su casa y las pocas personas que reparan en ella lo hacen con frialdad o repulsa, y en los mejores casos lo hacen con compasión ante la fealdad de la muchacha. Sin embargo, Pécola sabe como conseguir cambiar su vida, y cree que si lo desea mucho esta se lo concederá. Pécola quiere tener los ojos azules porque ""nada malo puede pasarte si tienes los ojos azules"" ¿no?Lo primero que choca es la dispersa narración de los hechos, inicialmente no estamos muy seguros si empezamos por el principio o por el final, pero rápidamente la autora nos sumerge en todos los temas que va a tratar. A través de las voces inocentes de dos niñas amigas de Pécola, va a describirnos el horrible mundo de los adultos, la violencia que estos ejerces hacía otros y el punto de normalización que las personas adultas llegan a fomentar, bien por ignorancia bien por sobrevivir, ante toda esta violencia injustificada.""Ojos azules"" nos narra una historia sobre la gran trampa del racismo y como somete a este a los propios afectados. Como dos tonos más claros de piel podían ponerte en una situación de ventaja con respecto al que tenías debajo y como esto se aprovechaba sin pudor o a veces sin comprensión. Esa metáfora de los ojos azules como protectores contra las desagracias vuelan durante toda la novela, dejando claro hasta que punto los negros no tenían ninguna oportunidad contra los blancos y que pese a que la esclavitud estuviera abolida hacía mucho, la resaca de tremenda barbarie seguía (y sigue) fresca mucho tiempo después. Me gusta mucho como Toni entrelaza en sus historias el racismo y el machismo, porque son las mujeres las que viven esta doble violencia con más intensidad. Sus personajes femeninos son poderosos o no lo son, pero siempre viven una deseventaja doble por el hecho de ser mujeres y negras. En ""Ojos azules""aparecen muchas mujeres negras con vidas diversas, pero ninguna de ella se salva del maltrato de un marido, de una jefa blanca, de un compañero de clase, o de cualquier hombre blanco que pase por el lugar. El relato constamente te hace sentir incómodo e impotente.Creo que es un acierto monumental que las voces que cuenten la historia sean infantiles, ya que llega a existir cierto cinísimo y falta de importancia en ellas, hacia hechos horribles que sufre la protagonista. Todo el sentido de la novela reside en las conversaciones que estos adultos tienen delante de las niñas, conversaciones donde siempre se criminaliza a la mujer por las acciones violentas que los hombres ejercen hacia ellas. Los niños, y principalmente, las niñas aprenden creyendo que es culpa de ellas, que en las acciones de los hombres, la culpabilidad debe recaer siempre en una mujer. Y así crece y triunfa el machismo durante los siglos y los siglos, de madres y padres a hijas e hijos. Un ciclo sin fin. En definitiva, leed a Toni Morrison, porque aunque no es una autora fácil ni en los temas que toca, ni en la forma en la que decide mostrarlos, es una autora imprescindible y no hay otra igual. Tanto en ""Beloved"" como en ""Ojos azules"" consigue mostrar temas bastante complejos de digerir que de alguna manera te hacen replantearte ""y tú ¿qué harías?"".

Throughout the course of her narrative Toni Morrison captures with painful lucidity the damage inflicted on a black child by a society that equates whiteness with beauty and goodness, and blackness with ugliness and evil.In her introduction to her novel Morrison explains her inspiration of the novel. Like Morrison’s own friend, the central character in The Bluest Eye, Pecola, is a black girl who yearns for ‘blue eyes’. Similarly to Sula in the eponymous novel, Pecola becomes her community’s scapegoat, but, whereas Sula embraces who she is, Pecola’s self-hatred is compounded by her community’s demonisation of her. The more people speak of her with contempt, the stronger her desire for blue eyes becomes.Rather than making us experience Pecola’s anguish first-hand, Morrison makes readers into complicit onlookers. We hear the venomous gossip that is exchanged between the various members of Pecola’s community, we witness the horrifying sexual abuse Pecola’s father inflicts on her—from his point of view, not hers—and the good-hearted, if ultimately inadequate, attempts that two other young girls, Claudia and Frieda, make to try and help Pecola.The adults in this novel are color-struck and condemn Pecola for her parents’ actions, suggesting that she herself is to blame for the violence committed against her. The story is partly narrated by Claudia, whose childhood naïveté limits her comprehension of Pecola's experiences. We are also given extensive flashbacks in which we learn more about Pecola's parents (their youth, their eventual romance, and their extremely fraught marriage). There are also scenes focused on characters that belong to Pecola’s community and who either use or abuse her. Throughout the course of the narrative, regardless whose point of view we are following, it is clear that Pecola is suffering, and that her home-life and environment are fuelling her self-loathing.This is by no means an easy read. There is a nauseatingly graphic rape scene, incest, and domestic violence. Pecola is bullied, maltreated, and abused. The few moments of reprieve are offered by Claudia and Frieda, who unlike Pecola can still cling to their childhood innocence.Pecola’s story is jarring and sobering, and at times reading The Bluest Eye was ‘too much’. Nevertheless, I was hypnotised by Morrison’s cogent style. She effortlessly switches from voice to voice, vividly rendering the intensity or urgency of her characters’ inner monologues. In her portrayal of Pecola’s descent into madness Morrison is challenging racist ideals of beauty, binary thinking, and the labelling of races and individuals as being either good or evil. Pecola’s family, her community, even the reader, all stand by as Pecola becomes increasingly detached from her reality. This a tragic story, one that is bound to upset readers. Still, the issues Morrison addresses in this novel are as relevant today as they were fifty years ago.Show more"

The Bluest Eye examines the ways in which latent cultural measures of beauty and self-worth can become reinforced and self-perpetuating. White people figure rarely in the narrative, and yet whiteness is pervasive as the very currency of self-worth: a means of defining value, and of establishing one's own superiority over others. The novel digs out the dirt to examine the roots of this behaviour, but provides no comfortable resolution for the reader.This was my first Toni Morrison novel (and hers too).

This is her first book, published in 1970. She went on to win a Nobel Prize and Pulitzer Prize and now has many of her books banned in some libraries. I read Beloved many years ago and only remember its power and awfulness. This book has both. Some of the passages blew me away, yet the book hardly holds together as a novel as it is so segmented.I do indeed recommend it as a powerful testament to an amazing writer writing about the black experience as it was in the 1960s in America and before. The characters and dialogue in sections will remain with me for a very long time, that's for sure. Can't say it was an easy or pleasant read, but I'm glad I read it. I've included a few passages below that somehow resonated with me. Four+ stars, a library ebook.Everybody in the world was in a position to give them orders. White women said, “Do this.” White children said, “Give me that.” White men said, “Come here.” Black men said, “Lay down.” The only people they need not take orders from were black children and each other. pg 111Cholly lay on his back panting. His mouth full of the taste of muscadine, listening to the pine needles rustling loudly in their anticipation of rain. The smell of promised rain, pine, and muscadine made him giddy. The sun had gone and pulled away its shreds of light. pg 115Never did he once consider directing his hatred toward the hunters. Such an emotion would have destroyed him. They were big, white, armed men. He was small, black, helpless. His subconscious knew what his conscious mind did not guess—that hating them would have consumed him, burned him up like a piece of soft coal, leaving only flakes of ash and a question mark of smoke. He was, in time, to discover that hatred of white men—but not now. pg 119Cholly sat. He knew if he was very still he would be all right. But then the trace of pain edged his eyes, and he had to use everything to send it away. If he was very still, he thought, and kept his eyes on one thing, the tears would not come. So he sat in the dripping honey sun, pulling every nerve and muscle into service to stop the fall of water from his eyes. While straining in this way, focusing every erg of energy on his eyes, his bowels suddenly opened up, and before he could realize what he knew, liquid stools were running down his legs. pg 122Show more"

The Bluest Eye is the story of Pecola, who wishes desperately for blue eyes, which she equates with beauty, belonging, and all that is good in the world. Pecola does not have a good childhood (her father is a drunk and her mother barely cares for her children) and sadly we witness Pecola's life devolve from bad to much worse.It pretty much goes without saying that Morrison's writing was beautiful, but it was also more accessible than I thought it would be. I was intrigued by the structure as we jumped back in time to understand the history of the characters and how this history leads to the terrible events in Pecola's life. The story is narrated from the perspective of a young black girl who is friends with Pecola and we never hear from Pecola herself. I understand this was a conscious choice on Morrison's part, but it still left me wishing to hear Pecola's perspective at least once.Morrison explores society's obsession with beauty, but particularly a certain kind of beauty- standards and ideals that have been perpetuated throughout time. Of course the author writes about race and the divides created between white people and black people and between black people who despise their own blackness and other black people.The overwhelming feeling when I finished this book was sadness. Pecola is mistreated and downtrodden her entire life and she deserves none of it. I can't wait to pick up another book by Morrison, although not right away because I'll need some time to recover from this one.If you want to hear me talk more about this novel, I discussed it in my February wrap-up: https://youtu.be/_GTUZuEB6h8Show more"

Και προσευχόταν να αποκτήσει γαλάζια μάτια, τα γαλάζια μάτια ενός λευκού κοριτσιού, γιατί πάντα πίστευε πως αν τα μάτια της ήταν διαφορετικά, ‘όμορφα’, θα ‘ταν διαφορετική και η ίδια, θα ήταν αλλιώτικος ο κόσμος ή, έστω, ο τρόπος που θα τον έβλεπε πια, ίσως να ‘ταν κι η μητέρα της κι ο πατέρας της αλλιώς. «Κάθε νύχτα, ο κόσμος να χαλούσε, εκείνη προσευχόταν ν’ αποκτήσει γαλάζια μάτια. Για ένα χρόνο είχε προσευχηθεί πυρετωδώς. Αν και είχε αποθαρρυνθεί λιγάκι, διατηρούσε τις ελπίδες της. Το να αποκτήσει κάτι τόσο θαυμαστό όσο αυτό, απαιτούσε πολύ, πολύ καιρό». Το πρώτο μυθιστόρημα της Toni Morrison (The Bluest Eye, 1971) διαδραματίζεται στον τόπο που γεννήθηκε η συγγραφέας, το Λορέιν του Οχάιο, σε μια εποχή που οι ταξικοί διαχωρισμοί είναι διακριτοί και η κοινωνία ‘λευκοκρατείται’ (και ανδροκρατείται)∙ που οι γυναίκες στις γειτονιές των μαύρων γράφονται σε παιδαγωγικές σχολές και σχολές οικιακής οικονομίας και μαθαίνουν πώς να κάνουν τέλεια τις δουλειές των λευκών: οικοκυρικά για να ετοιμάζουν το φαγητό τους, και παιδαγωγική για να διδάσκουν στα μαύρα παιδιά τους την υπακοή και την πειθαρχία∙ που ακόμη και μέσα στις κοινότητες των μαύρων οι άνθρωποι διακρίνονται σε έγχρωμους και νέγρους: οι έγχρωμοι είναι καθαροί και ήσυχοι, οι νέγροι βρώμικοι και φωνακλάδες. Στο πλαίσιο αυτό, η Toni Morrison διηγείται την ιστορία της Πέκολα Μπρήντλαβ που μεγαλώνει ανάμεσα σε έναν πατέρα που δεν έχει ιδέα τι σημαίνει να ανατρέφεις παιδιά (μην έχοντας δει ποτέ ένα γονιό να ανατρέφει τον ίδιο) κι αναζητά την ευτυχία στο αλκοόλ, και μια μητέρα που ξενοδουλεύει στα σπίτια των λευκών για να τα βγάζει πέρα. Η Πέκολα, νιώθοντας πως την αγνοούν ή τη σιχαίνονται στο σχολείο, πασχίζει να αναζητήσει το μυστικό της ασχήμιας της. Κι ονειρεύεται να αποκτήσει τα πιο γαλάζια μάτια του κόσμου, για να ζήσει τη ζωή ενός κοριτσιού με δέρμα λευκό, να αναδυθεί από την κόλαση που την έχει καταδικάσει το μαύρο της δέρμα. Τη φρίκη που φωλιάζει στην καρδιά της Πέκολα και γέννησε τον πόθο της να ζήσει τη ζωή ενός άλλου (λευκού) κοριτσιού θα διαδεχτεί η είσοδός της στον κόσμο της τρέλας. Με τα Γαλάζια Μάτια η Morrison συστήθηκε στο αναγνωστικό κοινό, προκαλώντας, λόγ�� του σοκαριστικού περιεχομένου του συγγραφικού της ντεμπούτου, αμφιλεγόμενα συναισθήματα. Για την ίδια τη Morrison, μια από τις πιο εμβληματικές εκπροσώπους της αμερικανικής λογοτεχνίας σήμερα (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1993), ήταν απλώς ένα ακόμη βιβλίο που ήθελε να διαβάσει, αλλά δεν υπήρχε. Για μένα, θα είναι πάντα εκείνο το βιβλίο που είχα δωρίσει στο κορίτσι μου το 1996 (θεωρώντας από όσα έλεγε η περίληψη στο εξώφυλλο του βιβλίου ότι, λίγο πολύ, θα πραγματεύεται καταστάσεις ευτυχίας!), που δεν ξέρω αν το διάβασε ποτέ, αλλά θέλω να ελπίζω ότι δεν το έκανε τότε.

There are references to the Dick and Jane series of reading books which show an idealized happy white family with no black faces in the books. Black girls were given white, blond, blue-eyed dolls as presents. Shirley Temple represented childhood beauty. This also influenced how black girls treated each other, and made them feel inferior.Pecola Breedlove is a sensitive black girl with little self-confidence who lives in a dysfunctional family. She wishes for blue eyes to make her beautiful and loved. Her story is partly narrated by Claudia MacTeer, an emotionally strong girl from a nurturing black family.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,The Bluest Eye,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 16, 2020",34 likes,0,"Please note: I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author, not Ruby Dee. This is a book about a child who wants to be beautiful, and that means to have blue eyes. She is black. If you choose to read this book you should be aware that although the writing is exceptional, it is rarely cheerful:The first twigs are thin, green and supple. They bend in a complete circle but will not break. Their delicate showy hopefulness shooting from forsythia and lilac bushes meant only a change in whipping style. They beat us differently in the spring. Instead of the dull pain of a winter strap there were these new green switches that lost their sting long after the whipping was over. There was a nervous meanness in these long twigs that made us long for the steady stroke of the strap or the firm but honest slap of a hairbrush. Even now for me spring is shot through with the remembered ache of switchings and forsythia holds no cheer. Sunk in the grass of an empty lot on a spring Saturday I split the stems of milkweed and thought about ants and peach pits and death and where the world went when I closed my eyes.  (Chapter entitled Spring)Don’t look for hope or cheer or ever a glimpse of sunshine. Isn’t usually spring coupled with thoughts of birth and life? Here death is pondered. Here the lovely flowering branches of forsythia in spring are used as a means of inflicting physical child abuse. After listening to page after page depicting human depravity I sought to find one passage that imparted hope, compassion, the nice things that life affords human beings. Isn’t a book imbalanced if only the negative is shown? In this entire book I found two passages. Only two, and I am not so sure one of them can qualify, it being the physical euphoria implicit in satisfying sex. The other was the wonder of enjoying a hunk of watermelon on a hot summer day. The blue sky, the sweetness of the juice, the feel of such a moment is beautifully written. Yes, this author can write, I just wish she could occasionally use her talent to point out the nice things life affords us. Life consists of both the horrible and the wonderful, for all of us, even those who are the worst off. The picture Morrison draws for us is imbalanced.The author is extremely articulate:She succumbed to her earlier dreams. Along with the idea of romantic love she was introduced to another physical beauty probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity and ended in dissolution. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it and collected self-contempt by the heap. She forgot lust and simple caring-for. She regarded love as possessive mating and romance as the goal of the spirit. It would be for her a well-spring from which she would draw the most destructive emotions, deceiving the lover and seeking to imprison the beloved, curtailing freedom in every way. Although the writing is articulate, I object to the way the analytical, “civilized” language is used to debase all aspects of the characters and their lives. The dialogs are simple, but they are interspersed with passages as that above. In the audiobook, the very slow narration by the author accentuates the importance of each word. Clearly she wants us to reflect on the imparted message. To understand this text, the narration must be slow. You need this time to absorb the significance of each phrase. So what is the message of this book? It is the value and the importance of self-esteem and that friends and family must actively strengthen, encourage and support a child’s intrinsic worth. Self-esteem, of course at a balanced level, is a healthy trait. Those who lack a feisty character, those who are at a disadvantage given their youth, gender and race, those who have no support from friends or parents, those who are constantly criticized, never praised, never shown that they are wonderful just in themselves, can neither be loved or love others. They are doomed. They will go under. Yes, I agree, but I would have preferred that the author used her remarkable talent and writing ability to show both the horribleness and wonder of life and people. The lines read as poetry, but so very depressing. Human beings use each other; we are depraved and filthy, rarely do we act compassionately. Is that how we always are? I cannot believe that. I will not be reading another book by this author. Even the message is obvious.Show more"

La respuesta está en esa imbricada mezcla entre lo social y lo psíquico. En el efecto que produce sobre sí la televisión, las canciones, las burlas de otros niños, las muñecas de ojos azules, las palabras de la madre, las palabras del padre, repitiendo lo que generaciones han dicho y que resonará en la cabeza de otras generaciones. Lo que automáticamente el individuo repetirá, se dirá así mismo y volverá cierto. Se dice con palabras, con miradas y con la suma de actos cotidianos que van creando una verdad psíquica de una fuerza arrasadora. Así aprende una persona afro a odiar su propia negritud, que es también como una persona homosexual aprende a rechazar su propio deseo o un indígena su procedencia. Lo que está tan claro en la teoría, Toni Morrison lo vuelve relato ¡y qué relato! Nos va contando cómo Pecola aprende que es fea y cómo las personas de su entorno van introyectando que por negros no son dignos de merecer. Ese entorno es clave, porque lo que le sucede a la madre, producto de la desigualdad social, lo que le sucede al padre producto del implacable patriarcado y las opresiones padecidas por todos, van tejiendo la pegajosa telearaña en la que Pecola queda prisionera y que hará inevitable su destino, su fatal destino. Morrison no se limita a dibujar una víctima, humaniza a los personajes que degradan a Pecola y nos interpela sobre nuestra responsabilidad en este tipo de realidades. Pecola asume que los ojos son los culpables de sus penurias, que tenerlos azules lo cambiaría todo. Pide ojos azules, los anhela y busca, porque efectivamente unos ojos azules le habrían garantizado otro destino, porque los ojos azules simbolizan en la novela lo blanco, lo pulcro, lo hermoso, lo deseable; todo aquello que Pecola no puede ser, que no está demonizado.Pero no todos los negros son iguales, porque hay gente de color y negros. Este tipo de distinciones que también encontramos en otras formas de discriminación, la pone Morrison en boca de uno de sus personajes, de una mujer negra que vive en el norte. De nuevo clase y raza mezclándose; así como género, clase y raza se mezclan en toda la historia develando una realidad más compleja y llena de matices. Cada suceso pasa también por el lente etario y la edad de cada personaje se palpará en la manera de interpretar las experiencias, que es un aspecto muy logrado en el libro, la elaboración de personajes bien perfilados.A todos los aciertos de Morrison se le suma el estilo, esa forma de comunicar lacónica y exacta, sin adornos innecesarios ni palabras que sobren. Siempre he visto en ello un enorme mérito, porque consiste en elegir con precisión casi matemática las palabras pertinentes y que además armonicen embelleciendo. También le concede atención a detalles cotidianos cuya descripción evoca sensaciones y recuerdos, entonces, te identificar con lo pequeño, con lo simple del relato y también con lo más elaborado y complejo. Es una obra inteligente y hermosa que me emocionó de principio a fin.

(spoilers onwards) the conversation she has at the end with her imaginary friend will forever haunt me, I think that really sealed this book as a favourite for me. it is so chilling and difficult to see her truly deluding herself into believing that her eyes turned blue, her dream come true, and yet still not being happy and now obsessing over whether they’re the ‘bluest’. a true metaphor for beauty standards to this day and how difficult it is for women and young girls to ever be happy within their bodies and skin colour in a world where we’re constantly being degraded and compared. there’s so much more I could say, even her mom not believing she was raped is just the sad reality for a lot of girls especially in minority groups and it’s just upsetting. the pecola’s of the world truly deserve betterShow more"

La narración corre a cuenta de Claudia una niña que es parte de la historia, y adicional, hace uso del narrador omnisciente para contarnos cosas de los personajes.Las primeras líneas condensan y resumen un hecho, en esos primeros párrafos donde todavía no hay otoño o primavera se presenta el fundamento de todo, ya esos párrafos en sí mismos son una poderosa historia que no necesitaría más, pero el genio de Toni Morrison hace que lo que cuenta, se expanda y se multiplique.“Aunque nadie diga nada, en el otoño de 1941 no hubo caléndulas. Creímos entonces que si las caléndulas no habían crecido era debido a que Pecola iba a tener el bebé de su padre.”Aquí Claudia y su hermana Frieda son dos niñas que en su inocencia han plantado semillas en su pequeña huerta y han decretado que si florecen, entonces el bebé qué hay en el vientre de su amiga Pecola , nacerá sano y fuerte, el símil es poderoso sin ellas percibirlo han transformado un hecho terrible en algo sagrado, el surgimiento de la vida misma, en sus mentes infantiles aíslan un hecho inclasificable, del resultado, para ellas un bebé es un milagro y deben ayudar a que se haga realidad.Me podría pasar analizando cada personaje y cada párrafo de este libro, con singular alegría y pasión, no hay desperdicio en estas líneas, sólo hay una escritura potencializada, que mezcla inteligencia con genio de tal manera que nos regala algo que parece fluye sin tropiezos y que es ligero como el viento, yo me pregunto cómo se puede lograr algo así.Tanto Pecola, como Claudia y Frieda son niñas negras que viven con sus familias, son pobres en distintos niveles, porque desgraciadamente en la pobreza existen infinitos pisos que se parecen un poco el infierno, donde cada uno tiene su propio sufrimiento, y cada descenso significa mayores suplicios, pero ellas, sobre todo las hermanas tienen ciertos respiros y momentos que hacen que su niñez sea un poco más respirable aunque no significa que buena o siquiera regular.Hay escenas poderosas por si mismas que no necesitan adjetivos o énfasis en lo terrible que son, Pecola es una niña fea, callada y que siempre anda como anestesiada ante la vida, un día, tiene un poco de dinero y decide ir por unos cuantos dulces, es tímida y le cuesta hablar con la gente, ante este panorama, se desarrolla este actitud por parte del tendero:“¿Cómo puede un tendero blanco, un inmigrante de cincuenta y dos años, con sabor a patatas y cerveza en la boca, la mente esmerilada por la Virgen María de ojos de gacela, la sensibilidad embotada por una permanente conciencia de pérdida, ver a una niña negra? Nada en su vida había sugerido jamás que tal acto fuera posible, por no decir deseable o necesario.”Es decir, mientras la niña señala el dulce, el tendero desvía sus ojos de Pecola, como si esto fuera una suprema humillación, ¡mirar a una niña negra!La historia tiene dos grandes pilares donde reposa su complejidad y discernimiento, en la mirada inocente de Claudia, y en la objetividad como se presenta a los personajes mostrando debilidades, virtudes, todo un amasijo y sobre todo el origen familiar, que podría dar pistas sobre su comportamiento presente.No hay que pensar que lo acontecido a Pecola es el tema central del libro, no lo es, es solo un hecho que une todo, pero realmente el libro trata del tema mismo de ser negro en un país de blancos, pero visto con una mirada inquisitiva, conocedora, objetiva, que busca y explora a través siempre de una historia que en superficie transcurre cristalina pero que en el fondo arrastra todo tipo de cosas y cada cual deberá saber que encontró en ella, pero siempre lo más importante es la profunda reflexión sobre los individuos y como sus pequeñas acciones pueden matar al corazón más puro. Un tema paralelo, es un secreto deseo de Pecola, que ha nacido de ver la publicidad de los dulces o de ver películas de Shirley Temple, ella lo que más desea en el mundo es tener los ojos del azul más bello, y cada día alimenta ese deseo como si de un cachorro se tratara, lo alimenta, lo cuida, siempre está pendiente de él, y en su fuero interno sabe que si consigue tenerlos, dejará su fealdad atrás y la vida se vestirá de cosas buenas.El final llega al inicio, donde Claudia reflexiona sobre las caléndulas en ese otoño inolvidable.El mejor libro que he leído de Toni Morrison, aún cuando los anteriores me encantaron, debo decir que este fue mas allá de lo que esperaba.Show more"

We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength.”
Hallucinating. It is the only word that seems to capture the essence of this novel, which is harrowing yet with compelling, extraordinary prose, which is the first thing I noticed about this book. I, however, thought that it would be a not-for-the-faint-hearted's version of To Kill A Mockingbird. How wrong I was. I am still thinking about what gave me that idea.However, this isn't an easy book to read and comprehend, both stylistically and thematically. As much as the story was hard-hitting, the construction was ineffective for me, as if fluctuating the emotions that it wants to evoke in you. Especially the non-linear storytelling feels like it tries to humanize the acts of the evil spirits of the victimizers. Not that they were justified, of course, more so as if to show you what induces a soul to be consumed by those sadistic desires. But I can't deny that I struggled with it. Sometimes it is easier to see the world in black and white than in grey. Every single criminal can come up with an excuse for their crimes. Every single serial killer had a difficult childhood. But it is sometimes hard for the reader to empathize with the cause and the effect, both at the same time. Probably that's what Toni Morrison aimed at doing here, and I won't deny that it works admirably sometimes, but I can neither say that it doesn't fail miserably for me more than once.
""And fantasy it was, for we were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good, but well behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life. We substituted good grammar for intellect; we switched habits to simulate maturity; we rearranged lies and called it truth, seeing in the new pattern of an old idea the Revelation and the Word.
Given the circumstances under which I finished reading this book yesterday (43°C and no electricity), I am not going to be able to provide a proper review. Probably this wasn't the right book to pick up for reading in a single day, either. I need to tackle this one again, but the problem is, I already know what is in it.

I mean, it crushes the mind. The kind of violence perpetrated here, feeling historical and grand, terribly personal, preying on innocents, this book is truly horribly difficult to think about. It gets thicker with each passing moment of reflection. This book is a welcoming into the dark complex of humanity, standing like a building of horrors, a Pentagon, made out to be nothing less than a museum of our own terrific and sublime nature.I’m reluctant to say that the pieces here don’t quite add up with quite the power that they feel they are building towards. This book was squarely, simply, not written for me. I’m white. I’m male. I had the hardest time connecting with these characters whose history and whose ownership of place, whose connection to time and the world around them, is entirely different from any of the stories I grew up living or much of my own experience, much of my own sense of fear in this world. Certainly that limits my way of appreciating the art on display here. So takes that into consideration with my next comments.In the building of this novel a lot of jabs land, and they land hard. The writing here is incredibly strong, and so the reader is lead through a field of punches to the kidney and a few to the face, and the reader, like a boxer facing a clearly talented opponent, comes away with bruises and soreness. But the final blow isn’t quite there. There was no knockout. I’m not quite sure how there wasn’t. I thought I felt where this book was moving, could pick up on the hints and the moments. I opened each chapter with a feeling of dread - here it was going to come, I would be totally startled, totally alarmed, totally exhausted after this chapter. But, even as the event at the centre of the book happened, I was in a daze of confusion. Even slightly disappointed. Shouldn’t there be something more here?This may be characteristic of Morrison. She brings to her debut a wisdom and compassion for the human experience which many young novelists miss in their first books. As a result there isn’t much flash or sensationalism even in those moments when we think that there should be. I think this is probably part of how she understands the world. Nothing is surprising about people, they make sense in their own horrific ways, they are products of the crimes which have been committed against them. These crimes are complex. Some are committed by people, others by groups of people, many by “society”, which is and isn’t a character in this book. It is hard to describe I suppose, both for Morrison and the reviewer. But Morrison doesn’t want to point fingers. I don’t think that is her way. She wants to wrap everybody in a thick blanket, hold them, tell them that they are loved despite our broken and troubling nature, despite the way the world has treated them. It is melancholic, but it is powerful. Maybe the melancholy is the knockout. In the end Morrison didn’t want to leave my body on the floor of the ring, she wanted me to go out and look at my fellow humans with an ever more aware sense of the our universal victimhood, our universal resilience, our hidden rays of beauty and the overpowering, burdensome, destructive sadness of our existences.It is a joy to read books which become something more than mere words on paper and enter us in that funny way that the greatest literature does. It is a mystery to read those books which almost get there, but somehow miss a piece or two along the way and, in doing so, don’t quite fulfill their promise. I would squarely place this in that category of books, though it bears with it a power which makes it a necessary read. Morrison is a great writer with a careful patience in her observations, in her construction of her characters, in her humanism. Others can only hope to one day mimic her in their greatest of works. This is marvelous, subversive, troubling literature. Show more"

The most overt image of this is Pecola’s pathological desire for blue eyes, but it is also powerfully evident in the character of Geraldine, mother of Junior, who is one of the women who ‘come from Mobile’ and dedicate themselves to the erasure of their natural ‘funk’, and even more so in Pauline, Pecola’s mother. I found Pauline’s story the most affecting, because she was unable to show any tenderness to her own children, yet doted on the white child of the family she worked for (the berry cobbler scene is as disturbing to me as the rape) and was described by them as the perfect servant. Evidently, she doesn’t neglect Pecola because she is a cold, cruel person, but because a racist culture has ingrained in her a hatred of what it has designated as blackness (her husband’s fecklessness, her home’s hopeless poverty and cheerlessness, and her children’s ‘ugliness’). Morrison, in describing her behaviour to her family, ends by saying ‘and the world itself agreed with her’.I think this blackness-as-designated-by-white-supremacy is the same thing as the ‘funk’ that the ‘women from Mobile’ try to expunge from themselves. Geraldine’s son yearns for blackness in sexual terms when he longs to play with black boys. White-supremacy (and the black self-hatred that is its offspring) is a hatred and fear of the black body and its sexuality.Just before the rape scene, Cholly’s ‘freedom’ is described. I struggle to understand this idea of freedom, but it seems to arise from a litany of proscriptions he has transgressed. He has refused to conform to the demands of white supremacy, but as no alternative narrative to make sense of his experience or identity is available to him (Morrison suggests music could provide one, pointing, I guess, to the Black Arts movement and the reclamation of Black beauty/body/sexuality) he is almost a person without socialisation, without culture, so he can only behave reactively or out of feeling. As his experiences are largely negative, so are his actions. He is able to rape his own daughter without shame, in fact partially out of confused tenderness towards her, as he has no longer any way to make sense of relationships or the feeling of love – or, perhaps, since all his feelings are despised by white supremacy, they are in total confusion, with no way to distinguish kind from cruel, transgression from goodness.Claudia (and her sister) is to some extent liberated from racialized self-loathing, as exemplified by her rejection of the white dolls she was given. However, I don’t think Morrison has made Claudia immune, rather, she is pointing out that people enact moments and points of resistance to the onslaught of the white supremacist hegemony.I loved the book. I felt every word of it was a poisoned dart in the flesh of oppression. I was quite rightly discomforted.Show more"

Toni Morrison tells tragedy in such a way, the reader is still immersed in the simplicity and beauty around the suffering of the characters. No one is perfect, no one is completely damned. Each character is shown for their faults and struggles. The main character, Pecola, is a victim to everyone around her life's experience. She becomes the dumping ground for all of the hurts and rejection, though she has done nothing to deserve such. In the end she turns inward, trying to understand why she is so unwanted. Her delicate trust and nature, though beautiful in their own right, become the doorway allowing others in to her fragile soul. Highly recommended, however, be prepared to hurt.Show more"

I remember where I was sitting when it was assigned to my sophomore English class at Austin High School. While it started as another homework project, it quickly turned into reading a book I felt I had chosen for myself. I remember marking it up like I had never marked up any books before.Thematically, I had never read anything quite like this. It was a book that talked about adult subjects but the underlying themes of racism, otherness and feeling not good enough were things that my classmates were dealing with, particularly my classmates of color. It was the first book that really opened my eyes to how literature can create understanding and take you into worlds you don’t know.As Morrison’s debut novel turns 50 years old, it still holds incredible power to spark current conversations. I suspect that a lot of our book club members will be rereading this book for the first time since high school or college. I can’t wait to see how adulthood and now being in my late 30s will make this novel resonate in a different way. I look forward to hearing how others’ perspectives change as well.Of course, if you are reading for the first time, I hope you marvel at the beauty of Toni Morrison’s writing the way I did when I first picked up a copy. She is my favorite author of all time, and I am honored to be recommending her book to this special group of readers.Click here to get your copy today!Show more"

The manner in which Toni Morrison describes the “Allusion” at the beginning of this Riveting novel. The perception of Dick and Jane. Yes, we all remember the series of books in school. Yet, this time around there were a multitude of Elements that always make this novel my favorite by this author. I decided to make this my last book of my ~2023 Goodreads Challenge ~ and listen to the audiobook in this version. Toni Morrison BLOWS her novels away in her stage performance voice and movement of words. ~ Pure Beauty ~This will always be my Favorite novel by this author. Even in all of its heavy sadness, Toni Morrison touches on the horrors of racial and women oppression. She has always been an author Flawless with creatively battling these subjects also explored in this novel, “the blonde hair, blue eyes” white beauty standards.In Lorain, Ohio, Pecola has the desire to have ‘The Bluest Eyes’. She Believes having them will make her be liked by her classmates. This novel is so heavy, I’m sure to read this one again very soon because it is astounding the proportion of Metaphorical Literature this novel dispenses from beginning to conclusion. A True Masterpiece. This time, I realized how each Season in this story shared a different meaning also. Everything about this Novel is chilling. This second time around what stays with me more was the manner in Toni Morrison’s description of the house and furnishings. The one and only piece of furniture that causes any type of emotion is the couch; filling the owner with anger. “The furniture was anything but describable, having been “conceived, manufactured, shipped, and sold in various states of thoughtlessness, greed, and indifference. The furniture had aged without ever having become familiar.”This story continues explaining no memories among these pieces to be cherished. Yet, only Toni Morrison’s descriptive style could send a Jolt through readers to actually FEEL her gripping words of an item provoking a physical reaction. Brilliance! And, even this Impeccable author could lyrically express the Breedlove’s coal stove being the only living thing in their house. Simply Amazing…We learn also of Pecola drinking numerous amounts of milk from the Shirley Temple cup. In my younger years, I was not able to understand the reason for her drinking such an amount was because she was infatuated with Shirley Temple (looking at the cup) and idealizing the life and standards of what she saw from her eyes. Although this is a story that shows so much abandonment and sadness. It is one so Phenomenally written and can be used for endless discussions.And, after ALL Pecola went through in her life, the conclusion…the conclusion. Listening to the audio version just gave me chills, seriously. I struggled with even writing this review a couple of times. However, it became extremely important for the fact that so many readers share negative thoughts, views, etc. about Toni Morrison’s creative writing style and work. I admit, her work is not the easiest to digest. It took me several years to be able to Understand most of her writings and I am still revisiting her literary collection to Increase my Understanding at a wiser age. Even now, when I rate her novels 5 stars just is NOT enough (In my Heart & Soul ). But, this is Goodreads… Again, I highly recommend Readers to always listen to this author via audiobook.

With her unique voice, Toni Morrison brings to life a set of different characters, and tries to give an insight even to the most un-redeemable ones. Because even if their actions are horrid, no one is born evil, not really. They lose their humanity and compassion when others hurt them beyond repair. What happens to a little girl, that only wants to be seen and loved, when all around her people laugh at her, abuse her and hurt her? What happens to the soul of a child never truly loved? Pecola prays to have blue eyes, like the eyes of the beloved children in America, because maybe then, people will love her. It's a book everyone should read, if only to develop empathy to the weak and mistreated souls in our world. And maybe, maybe if everyone reads such books, this world will be a better place.Show more"

Nobel Prize Laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner, Toni Morrison has consistently broken my heart but given me each time with her beautiful, lyrical, and haunting prose, new insight. And The Bluest Eye was no exception as she deftly explored the meaning of beauty as well as psychological murder and the crushing of a soul in all of its insidious forms. The prologue to this powerful book talks about the children’s reading series, Dick and Jane so prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s which looms large throughout the book as an underlying theme with extracts from the book in many of the subsequent chapters emphasizing the glaring differences. 
”Here is the house. It is green and white. It has a red door. It is very pretty. Here is the family. Mother, Father, Dick, and Jane live in the green-and-white house. They are very happy. See Jane. She has a red dress. She wants to play. Who will play with Jane? See the cat. It goes meow-meow. Come and play. Come play with Jane. The kitten will not play. See Mother. Mother is very nice. Mother, will you play with Jane? Mother laughs. Laugh, Mother, laugh. See Father. Father is smiling. Smile, Father, smile. See the dog. Bow wow goes the dog. Do you want to play with Jane? See the dog run. Run, dog, run. Look, look. Here comes a friend. The friend will play with Jane. They will play a good game. Play, Jane, play.”
It is in 1941 Ohio that nine-year old Claudia and her 10-year old sister Frieda are introduced to Percola Breedlove, a temporary foster child in their home when her house was burned down by her unstable and alcoholic father, Cholly Breedlove. Through flashbacks and the retelling of stories, we come to know of the hardships and struggles endured by Cholly and Percola’s mother, Pauline Breedlove as they were exposed to racism because of their African-American roots. Percola is constantly reminded of how ugly she is while in school and in her neighborhood. She becomes convinced that she would be beautiful if only she had blue eyes, and that becomes her fervent desire. I can add little to the many reviews but to say, this is such an important book and a solid foundation upon which Toni Morrison built her incredible body of work.Show more"

I'm ashamed to say the The Bluest Eye is the first book I've read by this legendary author. I've struggled with my review for several days but what I know for sure is that Toni Morrison exhausts and stretches me mentally as a reader. She requires you to think on a deeper more profound level. Morrison's writing is heavy with symbolism, I found myself bookmarking pages and returning to read them again.Pecola Breedlove, is a young African-American girl who feels her dark skin (her overall appearance) is repulsive. She wishes for what has always been presented to her as “better”, she wishes for the blue eyes associated with white skin. This results in the rejection of her own brown eyes and self image. WOW! That in itself is enough to ponder upon and feel the torment in that type of longing. She feels that she would be pretty and accepted if only she had blue eyes. Feelings of rejection, being dislike or hatred be it justified or unjustified is a part of life however racial self loathing within a child is unimaginable. Morrison's elegant prose leads to reader to ponder several concepts--Who made you feel that you were not beautiful or that one race is more beautiful than the other? Who has failed this child? As you delve deeper into this story you discover several people who did not protect this young girl. The sexual, physical, verbal and emotional abuse were disturbing and haunting. One of my favorite statements in this book sums up the story perfectly for me, ""Something so grotesque as the demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society - a child; the most vulnerable member a female.""

Auch wenn er nicht so gut wie ihr bester Roman ""Menschenkind"" ist, so ist er doch durch und durch gelungen. Es geht um Rassismus, Klassismus und Sexismus und einem daraus resultierenden Selbsthass.""Indem Pauline körperliche Schönheit mit Tugend gleichsetzte, entkleidete sie ihre Gedanken, fesselte sie und häufte bergeweise Selbstverachtung auf."" Pauline hält sich für hässlich. Auch ihr Baby Pecola hält sie von dem Moment der Geburt an für hässlich. ""Die einzigste Zeit, wenn ich wirklich glücklich war, das war, wenn ich im Kino saß.""

Bei ihr ist es nicht Jean Harlow sondern kindgerecht Shirley Temple. Pecola wünscht sich ähnlich blaue Augen. Pecola wird später Opfer ihres Vaters Cholly.Die Rahmenhandlung spielt in den Jahren 1940 und 1941 in einer Schwarzen Community in der Stadt Lorain im Bundesstaat Ohio. Weiße spielen nur am Rande als Arbeitgeber oder eben in Kinofilmen eine Rolle. Die Männer arbeiten in der Fabrik. Die Frauen arbeiten als Hausangestellte für wohlhabende Familien. Die Männer geben sich dem Alkohol und der Gewalt hin. Die Frauen dem Gesang und der Kirche. Zu der Beschreibung der Gesellschaft kommt die Schilderung einzelner Schicksale hinzu. Das ist nicht immer leicht zu ertragen. Es gibt Opfergeschichten, aber auch in einem Kapitel die Biografie eines Täters. Dort wird keine Erklärung geliefert, was den Roman so stark und gleichzeitig so bedrückend macht. Ohnehin lassen die Ambivalenzen im Text keine ganz klaren Zuschreibungen zu, und das ist gut so.Sprachlich lebt der Roman von lebensnahen Dialogen auf der einen Seite und Formulierungen, in denen beschreibende und reflektierende Elemente zusammentreffen auf der anderen Seite.

They say it's a book about the obsession over beauty, and the story of a black girl who wanted blue eyes. Despite the title, this book is not about eyes nor about the girl who wanted blue eyes per se, but rather about identity, love, self-hate and desire. It follows the stories of different characters as they grow and develop their sense of self, each of them distorted in some unique way. It is the story of women who fight to retain their passion among people who use violence to beat desire out of them; of men who despise themselves and their instincts, turning into perverts, rapists and pedophiles. It is a hard, heart-breaking story, which, just like any other Toni Morrison's novel, cuts deep under your skin and you know, from the moment you close the book, that it will never leave you completely.Toni Morrison's characters, the most tragic, poetic, horrible and unsettling people you can imagine, survive in a hostile world which only allows them to live lives that have already been decided for them; lives made without choice, without hope, without a possibility to escape. You can either be this kind of black woman or this other kind of black woman; you can either be this kind of black man or this other kind of black man. You can never, for example, be white; or be one of those neat black women who own a big house with crinoline and linens, and pretty fake flowers, and straighten their hair and wear Sunday shoes. On the other hand, those women can only be themselves, and so on.""They never seem to have boyfriends, but they always marry. Certain men watch them, without seeming to, and know that if such a girl is in his house, he will sleep on sheets boiled white, hung out to dry on juniper bushes, and pressed flat with a heavy iron. There will be pretty paper flowers decorating the picture of his mother, a large Bible in the front room. They feel secure. [...] Her hips assure them that she will bear children easily and painlessly. And they are right.What they do not know is that this plain brown girl will build her nest stick by stick, make it her own inviolable world, and stand guard over its every plant, weed, and doily, even against him. [...] A sidelong look will be enough to tell him to smoke on the back porch. [...] Nor do they know that she will give him her body sparingly and partially.He must enter her surreptitiously, lifting the hem of her nightgown only to her navel. He must rest his weight on his elbows when they make love, ostensibly to avoid hurting her breasts but actually to keep her from having to touch or feel too much of him.""Pecola cannot have blue eyes; a fatherless boy cannot have dignity, a sad misanthrope cannot have a healthy relationship with a woman. Those things are simply out of reach. People are doomed, maddened by desire or by the effort of eradicating it from their bodies and souls. They blame themselves, their ethnicity, their parent, God. Or, in the end, they just stop trying to find a reason for their useless existence, and simply accept what life had given them. Physical pain, deformity, rape, incest, pedophilia, ugliness. There is no escape, no happy ending, for any of these characters. A terrible, powerful story, or rather collection of stories; guaranteed to touch you deeply and resonate with you, regardless of your age, gender, ethnicity or religious background; as it is the story of the tragedy of being human.

I read Beloved in the eleventh grade, all those many years ago now. Bold choice on the part of my English teacher, but he took his chances and that’s why we loved him. I didn’t always understand what was going on. I did tap into a spiritual line, however, following every word with awe. That book did things to my mind that I still remember today, despite never having picked it up again (something that will change soon enough).I have just finished Morrison’s first book, The Bluest Eye, and I know for sure she is probably in my current list of top 5 authors. Definitely top 10, but probably top 5. There is gravity in her every word, and the scenes she chooses to sketch are uncompromising. She grabs you by the balls and forces you to look at things you may never have wanted to look at. And you can’t look away! Try as you god damn might, you cannot look away. I may not even necessarily agree with the minute ways in which she went about creating the structure for this story. Her foreword shows that she agrees:“One problem was centering the weight of the novel’s inquiry on so delicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing. My solution – break the narrative into parts that had to be reassembled by the reader – seemed to me a good idea, the execution of which does not satisfy me now. Besides, it didn’t work: many readers remain touched but not moved.”It doesn’t even matter. I think a lot of readers, myself included, are touched and moved. Besides, the book is good enough to work itself above and beyond any of these trifling complaints, and Morrison herself accurately describes why:“When I began writing The Bluest Eye, I was interested in something else. Not resistance to the contempt of others, ways to deflect it, but the far more tragic and disabling consequences of accepting rejection as legitimate, as self-evident. I knew that some victims of powerful self-loathing turn out to be dangerous, violent, reproducing the enemy who has humiliated them over and over. Others surrender their identity, melt into a structure that delivers the strong persona they lack. Most others, however, grow beyond it. But there are some who collapse, silently, anonymously, with no voice to express or acknowledge it. They are invisible. The death of self-esteem can occur quickly, easily in children, before their ego has “legs,” so to speak. Couple the vulnerability of youth with indifferent parents, dismissive adults, and a world, which, in its language, laws, and images, re-enforces despair, and the journey to destruction is sealed.”Show more"

Morrison writes of a community of African-Americans shortly before WWII. The primary subject of the book is racial self-hatred. For a variety of reasons - generations of families living in poverty, no education, no or demeaning jobs, societal prejudice, generations of abuse, forced to live permanently in a lower social-economic class intentionally imposed through legal and social mechanisms - many African-Americans have a toxic self-image. Morrison's book takes place in 1941. We meet two Black-American families. First we meet Frieda and Claudia MacTeer, two incredibly cute little girls, sisters, who josh and tussled their way into my heart. They have a tough mother, but these little girls are loved by their mom, despite the poverty and their mother's tough-love ways.Soon, we get to know another Black-American family. Charlie (Cholly) Breedlove, is in jail. Pauline (Polly) Breedlove has moved in with her White employers, the Fishers. Polly has abandoned her own kids, preferring to spend all of her time with the Fishers. The Fishers had hired Polly as a maid. Polly had been working for them for a number of years, taking loving care of the Fishers' little girl, whom Pauline now calls 'baby'.

Morrison proved that she doesn’t need a lot of words or pages to make a powerful point, something I’m sure a lot of authors strive to achieve but never quite do..The Bluest Eye tells, through a myriad of perspectives (one of my favourite literary techniques), the gut-wrenching story of Pecola Breedlove, a young girl suffering under the harmful racial beauty standards she’s subject to. I don’t usually read introductions before I start a book (they’re usually full of spoilers), but I read Morrison’s foreword and it was illuminating, and also made it all the more heartbreaking as she revealed it was based on something she actually witnessed - a young black girl she knew as a child who wished for blue eyes because she thought they were the most beautiful..She writes so eloquently about the ingrained prejudices and the awful power imbalances at play, especially in working relationships between black people and white people. It broke my heart reading about Mrs Breedlove basically having to deny her own child to keep the child of her white employer happy. Morrison questions and challenges how and why such racial self-loathing is learned by innocent children by telling it through the story of one of the most vulnerable, and truly Pecola’s story will stick with me for a long time.Show more"

It is a racially charged book that is bursting at the seams with half a century's worth of anger and truth. It is a book that is peppered with evidence of the sexual abuse that underlies coming of age as a colored girl in the US.  The Bluest Eye , bears hard facts about the condition of blacks in America that are difficult for anybody to acknowledge. In a poetic and tangled tale woven from the stars themselves, Toni Morrison tackles issues of beauty, poverty and racism. Morrison challenges the idea that ""a white baby doll"" is something everyone wants, whereas the idea of a ""black baby doll"" is unfathomable. Morrison showcases the racism that comes with different levels of pigment, not just from whites, but from other blacks too. She shows how the crushing weight of this warped thinking can kill the spirit of a little black girl and rip her wings off before she can even attempt to fly. The Bluest Eye  asks, ""Who is to blame?"" and answers, ""Everyone.""It's hard for people to read this type of book because it makes them feel uncomfortable. So people shrug it off because they don't feel it has anything to do with them. But how can this not affect someone? Even if you don't consider yourself black or white or American, there is something for everyone in this twisted tale of misery. ""Why are you mad at me?...Because my eyes aren't blue enough?

Her writing alone deserves praise. raw, candid, precise, unrelenting, it is obvious within the first chapters why she has easily taken her place of importance in African American literature. This is a difficult read, especially for those who have experienced such oppression themselves. But most readers can relate to not fitting in, to being subjected to society's superficial whims. ""There cannot be anyone, I am sure, who does not know what it feels like to be disliked, even rejected, momentarily or for sustained periods of time. Perhaps the feeling is merely indifference, mild annoyance, but it may also be hurt. This novel is, first and foremost, a statement. A feminist view against racism, discrimination, and our illogical focus on superficial beauty, while neglecting to see whom we often coldly obliterate on the path to this fruitless cause. As a social statement, this novel was commendable. As a coherent, fluid, even overall fulfilling experience? Not really. It was of comfort to read that Morrison herself agrees with this, as quoted in the foreword. ""My solution... parts that had to be reassembled by the reader, seemed to me a good idea, the execution of which does not satisfy me now. Besides, it did not work... readers remain touched but not moved.""It may even be that some of us know what it is like to be actually hated for things we... Cannot change. When this happens, it is some consolation to know that the dislike or hatred is unjustified, that you do not deserve it. And if you have the emotional strength and/or support from family and friends, it is reduced or erased. We think of it as the stress (minor or disabling) that is part of life... I was interested in something else... to enter the life of the one least likely to stand such forces because of youth, gender, and race... a bleak narrative of psychological murder."" I agree with her personal assessment. As her debut novel, The Bluest Eye is remarkable. But it is lacking. The promise, the potential is there. Her writing is already something to be recognized. But the sum of its parts did not add up to a whole. Two more things that I would additionally like to note. I would have liked our main character, Pecola Breedlove, to have her own voice. That would have made this far more powerful. Even her point of view, which was barely ventured into (the novel was mostly narrated by Claudia, sisters with Freida, and they were friends with Pecola for a while; a few chapters seem to be told from an omniscient third person view). Secondly, I guess the ending was an allegory? Symbolic? Furthering the aim of the statement made by Morrison on society's view on beauty? It simply did not work for me; almost like a try at magical realism where it obviously was not fitting.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49126210-h-kon,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 26, 2021",21 likes,0,"Morrison notes, like many of the existentialist philosophers, the oppressive gaze of others: Sartre famously writes that “hell is other people”, that we see ourselves from the point of view of the other, whereas Beauvoir argues that women internalize the male gaze and define their own beauty and value through male lusts, desires and ideals. Morrison builds on Sartre and Beauvoir by presenting the idea that black people internalize their concept of beauty, among other things, through the white gaze.In “the bluest eye”, beauty is co-opted by racist narratives, and internalized by black cultures. It is interesting for example, how traditional definitions of beauty so often seem to correlate with whiteness, and so often stands in direct opposition to blackness. Blackness then, even for black people, is the part of them that is undesirable. To become beautiful, black people must simulate white culture, mannerisms, tones of speech and appearance. In this novel, such simulation takes hold in a young black girl who wants blue eyes, because everyone tells her that she is ""ugly and black"". Morrison’s novel can in some sense be described as a sociological and psychological investigation into our notions of beauty: What those notions are, and how they are externalized and then internalized. The novel is particularly powerful because it calls for action. It requires of us that we examine our own oppressive gazes. It requires that we realize the damage we are inflicting on ourselves and others by our prejudiced and destructive stares. It is a beautifully written novel with poetically striking black colloquialisms and vernacular. The last page had me in shivers because of Morrison’s powerful metaphors. Something is rotten in America, and Morrison brings this rot to the forefront: she exposes it and deconstructs it. By doing so, she has also revealed the potential for renewal and emancipation.Show more"

The story takes place within an African American community that has internalized the standard of beauty that permeates the dominate white community. This definition of beauty places all African Americans at the low end of perceived desirability. But then within the African American community there is a gradation by which they judge their own relative beauty. This is the story of a young black girl who is judged to be ugly by her community. This young girl wants to belong and be loved, but her family and community do not provide it. In the end she is impregnated by her father and then beaten by her mother who doesn’t believe her when told about it. This family is understood to be most undesirable by their surrounding community of neighbors. Ironically, the neighbors feel affirmed by their perception of being better than somebody else since they themselves are judged less worthy according to the prevailing standards of the surrounding dominate white culture.This story is so sad as to be almost unbearable to read. No child deserves to grow up in an environment so lacking in love and emotional support. This book illustrates the need for the values and merits of black beauty. There’s nothing wrong with having blue eyes, but when a little black girl believes she could be loved if only she had blue eyes it is an indication of a dominate culture that is sick. All God’s children are beautiful and deserve to be loved.Some additional comments:This story's narration provides sufficient background of the parents as to provide an indication as to why the male characters tend to be unreliable spouses and the women relatively assertive. It's probably not a coincidence that the author chose the name ""Breedlove"" for the protagonist's family. A church with the name ""Soaphead"" sounds a bit unorthodox, but its preacher manages a miracle of sorts. Unfortunately a dog had to die to enable the miracle's message to be conveyed.

The story is painful exploring the idea of beauty through a young black girl’s eyes as she is constantly reminded of her unattractiveness due to the flawed standard of societal beauty and her need to have blue eyes as she believes it will magically make her beautiful. That being the center of the story we dig deep into the roots that shape her family’s history.  “I had only one desire: to dismember it. To see of what it was made, to discover the dearness, to find the beauty, the desirability that had escaped me, but apparently only me.”  I have experienced Morrison's beautiful prose that explores race and identity in Songs of Solomon and I thought that was magnificently handled but boy… this one takes the cake. I was holding my breath at times and I found myself rereading some passages over and over, I kept checking how many pages I have left so I can slow down but I also wanted to absorb the book again. This was masterful, painful every section of this book was handled with delicate care. Dissecting and reshaping the conversation around race in regards to beauty, complex black family relationships and how tiny past scars and inflict pain in the present. Each section opens with a season and the sense of place was pure poetry  “Sunk in the grass of an empty lot on a spring Saturday, I split the stems of milkweed and thought about ants and peach pits and death and where the world went when I closed my eyes.”  I could literally go on and on but this opened up a whole new level for me.

And when racism is internalized so, they cause irreparable harm to these young women, and to society itself.*I totally endorse this message! However, I cannot endorse this book. Morrison not only beats you over the head with this point, she does it with a progression of literary anvils that should make this book easy work for any high-school English teachers.The Bluest Eye has a good story buried in it somewhere, but its buried under Morrison blunt messaging. Her characters are deliberately unsympathetic and perhaps a little ouetre, and that at least, should make them interesting. I should care! But I didn't because they didn't feel like people to me.

The Bluest Eye is the story of Pecola, a poor black eleven-year-old girl who is sent to live with the neighbors due to her abusive family life. She believes if she only had blue eyes, her life would improve – she would become lovable and her family’s problems would disappear. The plot follows the many horrible things that happen to Pecola and flashes back to cover the disturbing backstory of her father. I liked the part where Pecola is taken in by a family to keep her safe, but the majority of this book goes into such upsetting territory that I almost did not finish. It is focused on why we have pedophiles, incest, and rape in our society. It also explores the concept of beauty and “magical thinking” by children, where they believe they are the reason for problems in their families. The subject matter is relentlessly bleak, so I cannot give it more than an “ok” rating. I can appreciate tragedies, but this book contains no hope.

This book made me think about a lot of things, like I would seriously read a chapter and feel like curling into a ball. I love this book, as much as you can love a book so heart wrenching and filled with so much sadness, but I love it.It made me question a lot social and cultural conditioning within myself, like how for the longest time I wished to be lighter than my current skin tone, because (and I hate to say it) having a lighter skin tone comes with much greater social currency. Let's face it as a black woman there is a lot of internalized self hate that I suffer from and through my constant introspection this is something that I am constantly working to get over. Like Malcolm X asked us,  ""Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet?"" Ms Toni goes on to probe the systemic dehumanisation of black people and how we constantly fail black girls and black women by insisting on victim blaming and stripping them of their power.

Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion.""Pecola Breedlove wants nothing more in the world than to be beautiful. Throughout her eleven years of life all she has heard is that she is ugly while blue-eyed, blonde and white little girls like Shirley Temple are considered the epitome of beauty. Pecola is Black with defined features and wants blue eyes so she can finally be beautiful. Her search for perfection will lead Pecola into dark corners of human existance that are best left unexplored.I have had this book sitting on my TBR list for a while. I always intend to read it but never actually get around to do it. In honor of Toni Morrison (may she rest in peace), finally I have read The Bluest Eye and I can see why it occuppies the place in literature that it does. Set in Lorain, Ohio during 1941 the narrative follows Pecola Breedlove in her quest for blue eyes. The book opens as she is staying with the family of Claudia and Frieda, her temporary foster family. Told (largely) through Claudia and Frieda's eyes, these girls share their adventures and their misfortunes. They share the pain through which Pecola goes through and how none of the adults seem to care. This is a book about racism but of the kind found interalized in the Black community. Beauty standards are skewed, a fact made quite apparent when the girls are given white, blue-eyed and blond dolls (and told to love them). Morrison's use of the Dick and Jane story of the ""typical"" American family to highlight the stark contrast between that story and Pecola's life was masterfully done. It is hard to love this book, as it is quite dark but Morrison's talent shines on these pages. This is a book worth reading.""They seemed to have taken all of their smoothly cultivated ignorance, their exquisitely learned self-hatred, their elaborately designed hopelessness and sucked it all up into a fiery cone of scorn that had burned for ages in the hollows of their minds- cooled - and spilled over lips of outrage, consuming whatever was in its path.""Originally published in 1970, this was Toni Morrison's first novel. This is not book that can be described as enjoyable as it deals with difficult and controversial subject matters (rape, incest and child molestation). None of it, however, was gratuitous and the delivery was raw, real and honest. There is more than one narrator and the tenses change throughout the course of the book. The fact that a significant part of the novel is narrated by children though contrasts their innocence and vulnerability with that of the cruel and unforgiving world in which they live. This is a different book about race. It deals not with outsider hate but with that of the community and their internalized racism, how there is a conditioning that starts in childhood. This is the reason Pecola can not see herself as beautiful. Her own family and community tell her that she is not. This is a devasting narrative but its a good book. There is no denyng that Toni Morrison is indeed a gifted author. I will defintely seek more of Morrison's work.Show more"

The origin of the novel lay in a conversation I had with a childhood friend. We had just started elementary school. She said she wanted blue eyes. I looked around to picture her with them and was violently repelled by what I imagined she would look like if she had her wish. The sorrow in her voice seemed to call for sympathy, and I faked it for her, but, astonished by the desecration she proposed, I “got mad” at her instead. - Excerpt from the author's Foreword to the 2007 edition, originally published as the Afterword in the 1993 edition.Toni Morrison's first novel from 1970 has lost none of its impact since first being published over 50 years ago. Although ostensibly about a young black girl's wish to be ""beautiful"" by having the blue eyes of white girls, it is the wide range of characters and the epic family portraits painted by the author which marks its greatness and its tragedy. The novel does require close attention as it changes character POVs, makes regular flash-forwards and flashbacks and intersperses a ""Dick and Jane"" narrative of the idealized lives of white people (which gradually symbolically breaks down as the novel proceeds). It is narrated mostly by a sister (by adoption) of the character of Pecola Breedlove, the girl who hopes to become beautiful by transmutation. The main theme for me became the tragedy of the legacy of abuse being handed down through generations. The search for ""beauty"" being a metaphor for escape from that abuse.Front cover of the original Holt, Rinehart and Winston edition 1970, which replicates the opening paragraphs of the book.

To be black in America, in the 1950s, was to be automatically ugly, because the standard for beauty was white.Toni Morrison’s first novel “The Bluest Eye”, published in 1970, was a beautifully heart-breaking and infuriating novel about self-hatred among black people. It is not difficult to see how the self-loathing rampant in the black culture aided and abetted the self-destructive tendencies of young black people. By the 1960s, when the “Black is Beautiful” movement started, much of the damage had already been done.Morrison’s novel is a commentary on the soul-killing standards of (white) beauty that bombarded young black girls growing up in a pre-“Black is Beautiful” America. The novel follows a young black girl named Pecola Breedlove, who wants nothing more in life than to wake up one day and have blue eyes—-bluer than blue—-just like the ones she imagines Shirley Temple to have.To her family and everyone around her, Pecola is ugly. She comes from ugly parents, and they live in an ugly storefront apartment in Lorain, Ohio. (Morrison herself grew up in Lorain, so it’s not a stretch to imagine that there is some semi-autobiographical truth in this novel.)The tragedy that befalls Pecola is difficult to digest, and sensitive readers should be aware that the novel includes graphic depictions of child molestation, rape, and pedophelia. There is, sadly, nothing gratuitous about any of these scenes. They are merely the inevitable results of a perverted world-view founded on racist notions of beauty.It is a great irony that a novel about the ugliness of Racism should also be so beautifully-written.I read this as an audiobook on CD, read by the author.Show more"

As such, I think everyone should be required to read it.This is part of what fiction is supposed to be. It's supposed to help us understand ourselves better, by showing us things that we are, and things that we aren't, by showing us things that have happened to us and things that have happened to others. In reading good fiction we learn about human beings in the world, and by extension, we learn to identify better with ourselves. Great fiction can even help us shape ourselves. But part of all this is the very painful process of coming across things in fiction that you hadn't looked in the eye before - horrible things slinking around in dark closets in the worst nightmares ever imagined. And in reading these great, horrible pieces of fiction, you know them for the truth. It's too easy to put them down and try to forget about them - to continue avoiding the eye contact. Don't do that.

It doesn't match Beloved in style and intensity, but it is truly impressive for a first novel. It relates the story of 11-year-old Pecola Breedlove who longs for blue eyes to escape the condemning gaze of others who judge her as quintessentially ugly. It goes from the external gaze of her classmates who mock her at school, to that of her unsupportive community and the American society as a whole who denies her very existence as a young black girl. This outward gaze turns inward as Pecola like many young African-Americans has internalized an inferiority complex. Her only wish to escape the blight of her alleged ugliness: BLUE EYES. The writing is almost drawn to perfection as the reader tries to piece together the jigsaw of Morrison's wounded characters.

I mean really they should have focused on how biased the jury was in taking this long to get that first. I personally don't know why Alice Walker never won Noble Prize when her book has an impact on so many lives. Tony Morrison was probably one of the most Nobel laureates. And here she proves it again.Lookism is probably the most common and most overlooked form of discrimination. The SJWs who will fight against discrimination on most other issues aren't above making jokes on 'funny' looking people. Do a person deserves a different treatment based on how they look?

""It had occurred to Pecola some time ago that if her eyes, those eyes that held the pictures, and knew the sights—if those eyes of hers were different, that is to say, beautiful, she herself would be different.""
Yet, it is really the main stock-in-trade for most comedians and cosmetics industries. It serves its profits to make you believe that there is something ugly in you. One of the ways it is done is TVCs. In the book, it is through dolls that conditioning comes in (Barbie dolls and Disney princesses continue to have impossible body shapes for a good reason. Even the philanthropic and social activists use the appeal of beauty for their purposes using picture a girl with beautiful green eyes (Gulab Gul) for encouraging people to be charitable. Even our sense of compassion is based on how good looking the victim of atrocities is. Morrison's book is based in a time when white skin was considered an essential part of physical beauty by most people in the West. It still is to a great extent in India. Exactly what determines what to be included in beauty?
""You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.""
And this book explores the kind of inferiority complexes, self-loathing, etc felt by people who consider themselves and their family members ugly and couldn't do much about it.
More and more she neglected her house, her children, her man—they were like the afterthoughts one has just before sleep, the early-morning and late-evening edges of her day, the dark edges that made the daily life with the Fishers lighter, more delicate, more lovely. Pauline kept this order, this beauty, for herself, a private world, and never introduced it into her storefront, or to her children. Them she bent toward respectability, and in so doing taught them fear: fear of being clumsy, fear of being like their father, fear of not being loved by God, fear of madness like Cholly’s mother’s. Into her son she beat a loud desire to run away, and into her daughter she beat a fear of growing up, fear of other people, fear of life. 
I kind of just love anything Morrison writes. Beyond the big themes, there is something so adorably human about her characters like where children are introduced by their mother in the same sentence as furniture and when the first narrator talks about not wanting to move an inch in her blanket because it would be cold there.It is strange though Morrison thought that this was no longer relevant because here is something from Lupita Nyong'o right after '12 years a slave':https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPCkf...Quotes:""Never did he once consider directing his hatred toward the hunters. Such an emotion would have destroyed him. They were big, white, armed men. He was small, black, helpless. His subconscious knew what his conscious mind did not guess—that hating them would have consumed him, burned him up like a piece of soft coal, leaving only flakes of ash and a question mark of smoke.""""More strongly than my fondness for Pecola, I felt a need for someone to want the black baby to live—just to counteract the universal love of white baby dolls, Shirley Temples, and Maureen Peals.""Show more"

Es una novela tierna y muy dura, magistralmente escrita, (aunque Morrison se lamenta de sus errores de escritura en el epílogo de 1993), original y con una construcción temporal muy compleja que crea un ambiente que envuelve al lector al mismo tiempo que le aísla y le atrae. Es una novela sobre la infancia, la crueldad, la conciencia de ser algo distinto a los demás, los secretos que se intuyen y que solo se comprenden mucho más adelante en la vida, la pobreza, la raza. Hacia esa atmósfera envolvente que crea Morrison llegan los caminos de los personajes desde mucho antes de que ellos nacieran, son rutas que recorres para llegar al momento justo, al punto en el que todo confluye. Me ha recordado a Panza de Burro por ese retrato de la infancia, de la manera de hablar, de la construcción del hilo de los pensamientos y de la realidad en que se vive pero claro, sin menospreciar para nada Panza de Burro, aquí hay otro nivel de maestría, de talento narrativo más allá del artificio y la capacidad para captar la oralidad. La novela comienza con una frase maravillosa: «Aunque nadie diga nada, en el otoño de 1941 no hubo caléndulas» y multitud de párrafos magistrales: «Todos nosotros -todos cuantos la conocemos- nos sentimos más sanos tras habernos depurado en ella. Éramos muy hermosos cuando nos erguíamos a horcajadas sobre su fealdad. Su sencillez nos decoraba, su culpa nos santificaba, su dolor nos hacía resplandecer de bienestar, su torpeza nos hacía creer que teníamos sentido del humor. Su incapacidad para expresarse producía en nosotros la ilusión de que éramos elocuentes. Su pobreza preservaba nuestra magnanimidad de ricos. Incluso sus sueños visionarios los utilizábamos para silenciar nuestras propias pesadillas. Y ella nos lo consentía, y con ello se ganaba nuestro desprecio. Nosotros pulíamos sobre ella nuestros egos, almohadillábamos nuestro carácter con sus flaquezas y nos abríamos desmesuradamente a la fantasía de nuestra solidez.»Corred a leer a Morrison.

I’m not sure why I waited so long to read her debut, but I finally did. Set in 1941 in Lorain, Ohio, “The Bluest Eye” follows a young African American girl named Pecola Breedlove who is frequently deemed ugly and inferior to not only the white community but her black community too. An internalized lack of self-worth forms into self-hatred, out of which emerges her desire to have blue eyes, something she thinks would elevate her out of this bottom-tier existence. But it ultimately becomes just another kind blueness and no one ends up ahead.This is a solid first book and I applaud Morrison for what she’s accomplished. There is a lot—and I mean a lot—going on here: racism, sexism, sexual abuse, poverty, standards of beauty, friendship, parental and sibling relationships, mental health, etc. And with all of these topics coming into play, the novel sometimes feels out of focus. The prose and story are worthwhile but the plot (and the rotating narrators) pulled me in so many directions that I feel like Pecola gets a little lost in the shuffle. Which is probably part of the point but I don’t know if I fully buy it. Even Morrison herself, as stated in the afterward, is displeased with how the story unfolds. And that’s kind of frustrating for me. We get a lot of backstory on Pecola’s parents, which helps in understanding how they interact with their daughter, but we never quite see how their histories mold Pecola. She becomes a voiceless object—again, I think that’s what Morrison is going for—but that lack of voice makes it difficult connect with her.This is still an important novel and one that I think people should read, but I’d be a little cautious before picking it up. I think Morrison plays with some of these themes better in some of her other works.Show more"

It can't decide what it wants to be about. It advertises that the main character is Pecola Breedlove, but most of the book isn't about her at all. The book is told from a first-person point of view by a little girl named Claudia, but there's even less of her in the book than Pecola! I read this book twice to see just what everybody loves so much about it, but it's just such a terrible book. We get a little information about Pecola's depressing life every once in a while between the even more depressing lives of the adult characters. However, I didn't spend enough time with these characters to get to know them, so how can I possibly care about them? It's one thing if it's a real person, but you have to convince me to care about a fictional character. This book was just violence and sex, and that somehow managed to be boring. Every character in this book is a genuinely bad person and/or has mental issues. That should be the set up to an interesting story, but this story lacked...well, a story.

Schwarze Frauen seien wie Pferde, sie gebären routinemäßig ohne großes Aufsehen. (WTF???)•	Die Art, wie sich Pecolas Mutter mit der weißen Familie, für die sie als Hausmädchen arbeitet, eine Art Traumleben aufbaut. Sie hält das Haus der weißen Familie sauber, kümmert sich dort rührend um das Kind, kocht nahrhafte Speisen , während sie in ihrer eigenen Familie nichts als eine Belastung sieht.•	Die Gegenüberstellung von Pecola und Claudia/Frieda als Figuren. Beides schwarze Mädchen, aber der Gegensatz, wie sie von ihrem Umfeld behandelt werden und wie dies mit dem Selbstbild einhergeht, ist schrecklich und beeindruckend.Ein heftiges Buch, ich bin froh, es gelesen zu haben, aber es hat mich auch ganz schön mitgenommen.

After reading it, I was under the assumption that this book was going to be about and African American girl who was struggling to see her own beauty in a world surrounded by whites, but that was definitely not the case. So please don't let the summary of this book mislead you.Secondly, this book was all over the place. I spent most of the time confused about what was going on. I felt like the events that took place was wildly out of order. It just jumped around way too much. If the book would have flowed more steadily, it would have almost made up for the thing that really upsets me about this trash. ALMOST.Thirdly, we were given so much background information about characters that were totally irrelevant to the story. It was like the author needed fillers to make the story longer. It was frustrating to waste time reading about a character only for the information to end up being totally unnecessary. As a reader, that irks me terribly and this book is filled with that nonsense. With this in mind, I was reminded about some of the events that happened that were also unnecessary. (Truthfully, the entire story itself was not needed, but...) Okay, let's get down to business. The thing that completely killed this book for me was the very descriptive child molestation and descriptive full blown rape of a child. (That left her impregnated by her father btw) Had I known, I would have done the world a favor and set this copy on fire the second it landed in my hands to rid the world of one less copy of this monstrosity. This book is every pedophile's dream. It was literally a child porn erotica. I can not stress this enough, after finishing this book, I wanted to pour bleach in my eyes and vomit profusely. Now you're probably wondering, ""if it was really that bad, why didn't you stop reading it?"" Well, the horrible events that took place wasn't until the very end of the book. It completely blindsided me. Here I was, expecting a story about a girl who learns to accept her physical appearance and see herself as beautiful and what not and instead it was a tragic mess and had nothing to do with the author's summary. It was like the author wanted to disguise her sick mind and encourage people to read this book by hiding the true nature of the story behind a paragraph of lies and misleadings. To make matters worse, the rape scene was told from the perspective of the rapist. Absolutely disgusting. I can't even comprehend how this book has so many good reviews. Are people really that okay was child rape? Maybe there would have been some sort of saving grace if this book left me feeling like I gained some sort of perspective on rape victims but that isn't even the case. The only thing I gained from this was literal nightmares. With all of that said, I feel like the author just wanted to write about child molestation and if we are comparing it to the summary on the back of the book, the story itself just doesn't line up with it. This isn't one of those books that give you perspective or teaches you a life lesson. Nope, this was a just a waste of time and paper. I am deeply uncomfortable with the amount of positive reviews. I am upset with the author for writing this and not getting charged with a crime. And I am horrified that any company would think this was acceptable to put out into the world. Typically, I like to donate books that I didn't like to others because I understand that not everyone has the same tastes, but I cannot with good conscience, contribute with the distribution of this story. I am deeply saddened when books are destroyed but I can not burn this piece of garbage quickly enough.Show more"

As an aside almost, she advised me to read her The Bluest Eye.Then, I read the novel. And, now I can say that the sentences uttered by Toni in the imagined interview are the apt descriptions of the novel that spanned some 200 pages. She had really said much.Beauty is a concept that is made by the society. And society anywhere and everywhere is divided. The division might have any number of basis or causes. Ultimately everything boils down to a single division - the oppressing class and the oppressed. In such a society all that is associated with the oppressing class is valued high. One among them is the idea of physical beauty. Not only that, the idea is propagated in every way possible till it becomes imprinted in the mind of everyone as the normative concept of beauty. The destructive nature of this structure is evident when the member of the oppressed class wants to acquire the characteristics of the oppressing class. This may be impossible especially when the division is also marked by the difference in the colour of the skin. So this is the story of a black girl, set in 1940s USA, wanting to be beautiful. To her to be beautiful means to have blue eyes like the white girls. Blue eyes on the black face is repulsive. But she does not know that. She does not even know that she is beautiful even without the blue eyes. Why? Because all around, everyone, including her own family members, considers black as ugly. The outside gaze decided everything. The beauty proper to each person and colour was not accepted. At last, anyway, she got the blue eyes. But at what cost? It is at this stage that I wanted to spit on the society. And I was also seriously aware that the spittle will be on me as well.An Aside:Being a Tamil, a south Indian I could very well associate this novel and the events narrated in the novel with many of the events happening in 'incredible' India. For instance, the vegetarian food (the food of the high caste society) decides the value of a person. The Classical art indulged mostly be the high caste people get high coverage in the media than the traditional art forms. A Tamil translation of it (in fact translation of it in many Indian languages) will be of great service to Indian society.Show more"

It’s a visceral story surrounding a little girl that is a societal punching bag. This young, dark skinned, poor, Black girl is mistreated and abused by adults, her family, light skinned members of her neighborhood, white strangers, etc. She suffers in her reality from every angle possible until her mind breaks in order to achieve some semblance of peace. The prose are lyrical and lovely in spite of the horrors it contains and my first impression of Toni Morrison is that she’s brilliant, especially given that this is a debut. I question the author’s choice to make a closeted gay man a pedophile, however. It’s the only acknowledgment or mention of homosexuality and to intertwine so intensely with the recurring rape of little girls is unsettling in a way that does not feel intentional. It’s deeply harmful, painfully dated, and extremely reckless. I’m also not sure what the reader is meant to gain by reading from the perspective of Piccola’s father during her rape. It’s moments like this where I’m forcibly reminded that no author—no matter how brilliant or important—is infallible. It’s a gut-wrenching read from start to finish that manages to tell the story of a little girl by telling the stories of all the people around her. I understand why it’s so well known and discussed.

With language as pure as poetry, we learn through Faulknerian, polyphonic narrative, Morrison as predecessor to Erdrich and Fred D'Aguiar, that racism acts like a twisted and debased game of telephone. Seeds of desire, the stuff of dreams and nightmares are planted, transferred, and projected, onto and within each of the different characters, only to grow deformed, mutated, violated, and unwieldy like wildfire, a quiet catastrophe that ravages our great nation.

Ela nos permite enxergar situações corriqueiras a partir de perspectivas que são totalmente estranhas à nossa realidade e que nunca teríamos acesso se não fosse por meio dos livros. E terminar a leitura dessa obra apenas confirma esse seu papel. Em pouco mais de 200 páginas, Toni Morrison consegue apresentar para o leitor como é crescer em uma sociedade em que as referências e os padrões do que é certo e bonito estão longe do que você é. Pecola Breedlove, uma garota negra nascida nos Estados Unidos da década de 40, sonha em ter olhos azuis. Pede a Deus todos os dias para que seus olhos se transformem em azuis. Para Pecola, quem sabe dessa forma as pessoas passariam a notá-la um pouco mais, passariam a aceitá-la. É um pequeno desejo de uma criança que carrega consigo inúmeros problemas históricos e sociais. Mas além de ser vítima de um racismo estrutural, que cria na garota uma recorrente necessidade de aceitação, a vida de Pecola também vai encontrar barreiras em situações de machismo, abuso sexual (há passagens com gatilhos sobre o tema), relações familiares e muita violência, sobretudo psicológica. Tudo isso acontece no cerne de uma família problemática, que, infelizmente, não parece indicar um cenário incomum: o pai de Pecola é alcoólatra e bate na esposa; sua mãe vive em função de cuidar da casa de uma família branca para quem trabalha como empregada doméstica; e seu irmão faz de tudo para conseguir fugir dos seus problemas. É uma família moldada por engrenagens de um sistema que funciona sempre da mesma forma. E apesar dos temas duros e sensíveis que atinge, a autora escreve de uma forma tranquila e com toques poéticos.

The Bluest Eye isn't an easy read. It's laced with a heavy feeling throughout, an oppression that radiates from the characters while slowly unraveling this story of several lives and how they intersect. Every decision, every action has a consequence and I found myself utterly captivated. Pecola is a character we see though the eyes of everyone around her. Growing up in poverty, she's in the shadows of each section of the novel and her desires are seen through the narrative of everyone else. It's as though we know everything and nothing about this girl who desperately wants blue eyes - a conventional beauty ideal that conveys so much about racial oppression and aggressions. It's almost as though the story itself is keeping Pecola oppressed and Toni Morrison made me think more about myself in 200 pages than I think any other book has regarding my own white privilege and social history.The only reason this didn't get a full 5 stars is the structure of the novel itself. It jumps around the timeline, and at times I struggled to orientate myself with what was going on and which character we were following for a couple of pages, which pulled me out of the story.

Thanks to Toni Morrison I (kind of) get it – she’s lays bare the issues as asks us to also question beauty itself against the ugliness of our perceptions. If the hate mongers could read, and would read this, there would be no strife. I read Beloved first, to see if I would appreciate this author, and I still tingle with its power. Beloved is one of the best I have ever read and it will stay with me. After that I decided I would read all of Morrison, if I’m afforded that time in life, in order, starting with The Bluest Eye. It is also brilliant, often harsh and terrifying, but brings the racial line in razor focus in a medium and style that simply could not have been better. A news story, nonfiction or a journalistic piece, simply cannot bring close the impact of racism on human life the way in which this novel did for me. That’s why I read, and I have no doubt the fiction medium is truer than “non”-fiction when done properly. I won’t go into the plot, as it is well covered by others, and my only criticism is the style is a pastiche and did not flow the way it could have. As a first novel this is forgivable, and considering it was written in the 1960s, a turbulent time for race relations, it certainly deserves the Nobel Prize it received. Morrison has created a place, in Lorain Ohio, much like Faulkner, but less fictional in that she no doubt has expanded on her own life more directly. Here are few things that hit me:p. 39: “This family, on a Saturday morning in October, began one by one, to stir out of their dreams of affluence and vengeance into the anonymous misery of their storefront.”p. 40: “Cholly had come home drunk. Unfortunately he had been too drunk to quarrel, so the whole business would have to erupt this morning. Because it had not taken place immediately, the oncoming fight would lack spontaneity; it would be calculated, uninspired, and deadly.”p. 40: “Cholly and Mrs. Breedlove fought each other with a darkly brutal formalism that was paralleled only by their lovemaking. Tacitly they had agreed not to kill each other. He fought her the way a coward fights a man- with feet, the palms of his hands, and teeth. She, in turn, fought back in a purely feminine way- with frying pans and pokers, and occasionally a flatiron would sail toward his head. They did not talk, groan, or curse during these beatings. There was only the muted sound of falling things, and flesh on unsurprised flesh.”p. 138/139, on being a black woman in 1941: “Then they had grown. Edging into life from the back door. Becoming. Everybody in the world was in a position to give them orders. White women said, ‘Do this.’ White children said, ‘Give me that.’ White men said, ‘Come here.’ Black men said, ‘Lay down.’ The only people they need not take orders from were black children and each other. But they took all of that and re-created it in their own image. They rang the houses of white people, and knew it. When white men beat their men, they cleaned up the blood and went home to receive abuse from the victim. They beat their children with one hand and stole for them with the other. The hands that felled trees also cut umbilical cords; the hands that wrung the necks of chickens and butchered hogs also nudged African violets into bloom; the arms that loaded sheaves, bales,, and sacks rocked babies into sleep. They patted biscuits into flaky ovals of innocence- and shrouded the dead. They plowed all day and came home to nestle like plums under the limbs of their men. The legs that straddled a mule’s back were the same ones that straddled their men’s hips. And the difference was all the difference there was. Then they were old. Their bodies honed, their odor sour. Squatting in a cane field, stopping in a cotton field, kneeling by a river bank, they had carried a world on their heads. They had given over the lives of their own children and tendered their grandchildren. With relief they wrapped their heads in rags, and their breasts in flannel; eased their feet into felt. They were through with lust and lactation, beyond tears and terror. They alone could walk the roads of Mississippi, the lanes of Georgia, the fields of Alabama unmolested. They were old enough to be irritable when and where they chose, tired enough to look forward to death, disinterested enough to accept the idea of pain while ignoring the presence of pain. They were, in fact and at last, free. And the lives of these old black women were synthesized in their eyes- a puree of tragedy and humor, wickedness and serenity, truth and fantasy.”Show more"

Hoje, ao reler algumas passagens, confrontei-as com o espetáculo “Nanette” (2018) de Hannah Gadsby, sobre o que aqui (no blog) tinha ontem dado conta, e senti um arrepio. O livro é de 1970, mas está tudo ali, não que não hajam obras anteriores, mas com esta força literária, capaz de colocar o dedo na ferida da discriminação, não existem muitas. As razões não são apontadas por Morrison, mas por Gadsby, porque quanto mais vamos interiorizando e compreendendo a sociedade que criámos, mais nos vamos dando conta dos papéis dominantes do homem, do hetero, e do branco. As maiorias dotadas de força, física ou política, nunca se coibiram de a usar, e esse é o mal que nos assola, o da incapacidade empática.O cerne da história de Morrison assenta numa menina negra, de um bairro americano pobre, que tinha um desejo: ter olhos azuis. Morrison diz-nos no prefácio que este desejo lhe foi relatado por uma amiga de infância, e que foi algo que a perseguiu durante anos. Assim aquilo que é colocado a jogo não é mais do que a vergonha do ser. A vergonha da cor dos olhos, da cor da pele, de Pecola que se junta à vergonha da homossexualidade de Hannah Gadsby. Porque quando crianças cresceram ambas envolvidas num ambiente de ódio e raiva contra aquilo que eram, e como diz Gadsby isso deixa marcas, podemos reconstruir-nos mas não podemos apagar-nos. Como é possível tanta violência, nem falando de adultos, contra crianças, apenas porque são diferentes?De Morrison conhecia “Beloved” (1987) que entrou diretamente para as minhas melhores dez leituras de sempre. Não posso dizer que “The Bluest Eye” vá para além, é uma primeira obra e o tema repete-se, a pobreza e a sexualidade das mulheres negras, mas e porque haveria de mudar? Quantos escritores temos a falar da realidade destas mulheres negras? Para não falar da realidade das mulheres. O tempo vai passando, fala-se muito, surgem movimentos feministas, mas continuamos a viver num mundo completamente feito de produção cultural masculina, branca e hetero. Precisamos de muitas mais Morrison e mais Gadsby, porque precisamos de compreender que o mundo não é feito de uma massa única, somos todos tão diferentes sendo tão iguais. De que adianta proclamar o humanismo se ele parece condicionado à partida por um modelo único de humano?Sobre a escrita de Morrison, tenho pena de não vos poder oferecer uma análise mais sentida. Li “Beloved” em português e aí pude experienciar a beleza da sua poética, dos seus ritmos e fluxos sintáticos que envolvem o significado daquilo que se vai dizendo. “The Bluest Eye”, incompreensivelmente não está traduzido para português, como não estão outras obras desta autora, que ganhou um Nobel em 1993. E eu questiono-me, como é possível que uma autora ganhadora de um Nobel não tenha toda a sua obra, ou pelo menos as suas grandes obras traduzidas para português? Só isto devia ser suficiente para acender os nossos alertas para tudo o que disse nos parágrafos anteriores.No entanto, como diz Gadsby, também não quero terminar numa nota negativa, nem fazer de tudo no mundo uma inevitabilidade da nossa irracionalidade. Não creio em mandamentos que nos vendem alguns arautos de que tudo é mesmo assim, pegando por exemplo em Jordan Peterson que para nos convencer do status quo usa a armadilha da vida como um caminho de sofrimento, tão cara às religiões seculares. Prefiro evocar Fred Rogers, e no seu discurso em defesa do seu programa educativo na televisão pública americana, em que disse o seguinte:""Isto é o que eu faço. Eu ofereço uma expressão de atenção todos os dias a cada criança, para a ajudar a perceber que ela é única. Eu termino o programa dizendo: 'Tu fizeste deste dia um dia especial, apenas por seres quem és. Não há ninguém em todo o mundo como tu e eu gosto de ti tal como és.' E eu sinto que se nós, na televisão pública, pudermos deixar claro que os sentimentos são mencionáveis e geríveis, que teremos contribuído para uma melhor saúde mental.” Testemunho de Fred Rogers perante o Senado dos EUA, 1 de maio 1969.Ler com links no VI: https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.com...Show more"

A lot of the books I acquire are through suggestions in magazines such as the New Yorker and The Week. Both publications worth every penny in print and in their digital forms. The Week recently wrote up a short review on Morrison's newest novel ""Home"" comparing her to my absolute literary god, Saul Bellow. It was as if the literary gods whispered in my ear, ""you have found a female author who is worthy."" I then went in search on Goodreads for friends who have read her work. Beverly (http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87...) has read most of Morrison's work. So I sent her an email inquiry and she was very kind to outline Morrison's work, her biography and even Beverly's favorite book. This is exactly what makes Goodreads an amazing forum for serious readers. I must ardently thank Beverly, because Morrison is exactly what I have been searching for. Toni Morrison is without question a contemporary female author who writes poetically, intelligently and involves tremendous themes. I have also learned that Morrison was the first black woman to receive Nobel Prize in Literature. The Bluest Eye's, Pecola Breedlove along with her friends see the world through such innocent eyes and the bond of their friendship is so beautiful in the eyes of the adult reader who knows the corrupt world they have not yet entirely discovered. Pecola prays every day for blue eyes and beauty because she feels inferior and ugly. It is not just this small girl praying for blue eyes that Morrison reveals. Oh no, the corrupt world the reader sees includes child molestation, incest and racism. The writing is raw, revealing and hides nothing. It should be revered for it's stark look at reality instead of people making numerous attempt to ban it from schools and libraries. Pecola's friend, Claudia narrates most of this story from her perspective as a child and an adult. Claudia's voice is soft, despondent almost sometimes, but clearly filled wisdom in hindsight. She remarks near the end of the novel, ""Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly."" Another remark Claudia makes is that when the girls stood beside Pecola they were beautified because of her ugliness, Pecola's guilt sanctified them, Pecola's pain made them glow with health, Pecola's awkwardness made them think they had a sense of humor, Pecola's inarticulateness made them feel eloquent, Pecola's poverty kept them generous. How can a reader not reflect inwardly after such remarks? How can a reader not realize their faults without thinking of a Pecola in their life? Morrison's existentialism here is beautiful.I want to share more with you about the plot and themes within this brilliant short book but I won't because in order for you to fully experience the discovery of a treasure such as this, I ought to keep my review at a minimum, just as Beverly did in her email response. It allowed this new follower of Morrison to discover and experience a female author who will always remain very close to my heart and be placed upon the bookshelf next to the few other female authors who I admire. Thanks again Beverly!Show more"

I read it many years ago and have come back to it now for Black History Month, and I'm still struck by what Toni Morrison penned down. It's hard to believe that ""The Bluest Eye"" (1970) wasn't well received until Toni Morrison won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993 and especially when Oprah Winfrey made it a selection for her book club in 2000. Morrison wrote a very powerful and complex debut novel about the deep-rooted perception of beauty among African Americans and the inferiority complex and exclusion suffered by those (such as Pecola) who don't reach that certain beauty standard. Pecola is about twelve years old and is constantly reminded by her parents and society that she is ugly. At home she witnesses her parent's tumultuous relationship, she gets verbally and physically abused by her mother, at school she gets bullied by both boys and girls, store clerks don't want to touch her hand when she hands them the money over... and right at the beginning of the story Morrison tells us that Pecola is carrying her father's baby. It's a subtle declaration (""We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father's baby that the marigold did not grow.""), but enough for the reader to want to understand what the hell happened to Pecola. Morrison paints numerous painful scenes, but expertly writes from the point of view of several different characters in order to not vilify one single person. Because at the end, society failed Pecola. We are introduced to her mother Pauline and why she is so unfeeling towards her own daughter. We learn about the past of her father Cholly Breedlove's and why he is unable to properly love his own daughter. Throughout the novel, we hear the voices of Claudia and her sister Frieda who were friends of Pecola and are probably the most reliable narrators without prejudice towards Pecola. There are scenes with Junior and his mother's cat, the light-skinned and pompous Maureen, the three lonely and warm prostitutes and Mr. Soaphead. This book reminded me once again how oppressed people are often inclined to oppress those who are weaker than them, because they don't know anything else than oppression. One person in my book club phrased it in this way, ""when people are in survival mode it seems a challenge to know how to love. there is love, but it is often thwarted."" Highly recommend this book for those who haven't read Toni Morrison's works yet. (Also her audiobook is superb! She recites it herself and her voice is just brilliant!)Show more"

Cholly is forced to have sex with a young woman by two lecherous white men and, knowing that blaming the men is futile, he instead blames the young woman. When Pauline, Pecola’s mother, walks in on her daughter after she has been raped by her father, her first instinct is to blame Pecola and Cholly, unable to find an outlet for his love for Pecola, is only able to express it via violence. Victim blaming is scarcely something which occured solely in African-American communities, however the essential powerlessness of Cholly against the white men, or Pauline against Cholly which is at the root of their immediate their reaction, as the characters are stripped of their power to empathise by the systematic dehumanisation they face-they choose to perpetuate and ape the subjugation which they face on those who are less powerful than them.Morrison’s style, in which Pecola’s story is told via a wide variety of narrative techniques and perspectives, each with their own grammatical idiosyncrasies, allows, somewhat uniquely, for the reader to explore the rape via the eyes of the victim, the perpetrator and those around the, building a deeply rich psychological tapestry and allowing Morrison to interweave a web of perspectives into the life of the unloved and unnoticed Pecola, whose dream of having blue eyes was the sole means of escaping the nightmarish life she inhabited.

Úgy gondolom, Morrison eljátszott a gondolattal, hogy ezt az utat választja - ám végül elmozdult egyfajta költői nyelv felé, ami szép és hajlékony, semmiképp sem olyasvalakié, aki ott ragad, hanem azé, aki kimászott a kútból, és megtalálta a szavakat, amelyekkel szólni tud.

The words revel in the senses. You see, smell, hear, taste, and feel. She had a strong grasp of the craft (past tense due to her unfortunate passing). However, this book will take you places you don't want to go. The sheer trauma of the black experience in America and watching Pecola grow up with a severely dysfunctional family was enough to force me to put the book down every so often. It pulls no punches. You know from the beginning the horrific sexual assault that is going to occur later. You see the world treat these characters as inferior because they aren't just black, but more black than others. And you see a fragile mind broken when it should have been protected and nurtured. Morrison spends time with each character and fleshes them out into the very humans they are. These characters are real and forceful and unfortunate. And that makes this book important among many other reasons. I personally found the chapter considering Soaphead Church as the weakest point. I get what she was going for. It was just here it seemed to break the fourth wall. I didn't see so much of a character as her masking herself as a character. Note: not his pedophilia but his anger. This book will definitely stay with me. I don't recommend it to victims of sexual assault.

It would be wrong of me to presume that I, as a white person, could ever properly understand the African American experience, but Morrison's works sure feel like I'm being granted a realistic glimpse of it. She writes about the ugliest things with poignant authenticity, rendered in the most beautiful prose, and in this remarkable debut, the abstract idea of what's considered physically ""beautiful"" is actually the central theme.
""Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion.""
Morrison has a special way of telling a story: She'll reel the reader in with a horrible, shocking revelation right at the start, and then work her way back up to it layer by layer. The Bluest Eye also has an interesting structure, being divided into seasons, and with most chapters epigraphed with fragments from a Dick and Jane story somehow pertinent to what's to come. Mostly narrated by the protagonist's foster sister, we follow Pecola's life, which is a veritable series of unfortunate events: She's a young black girl who develops an inferiority complex, convinced as she is by her family and reactions of others that she's ugly and worth less because of her dark skin. An ugly girl with an ugly name.""You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question. The master had said, 'You are ugly people.' They had looked about themselves, saw nothing to contradict the statement; saw, in fact, support for it leaning at them from every billboard, every movie, every glance. 'Yes,' they had said, 'You are right.' And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it.""Imagine being a young black girl, but only seeing girls who look like Shirley Temple at the picture show, and a generic Mary Jane on your candy wrappers. You are taught to read with primers featuring the far-removed reality of a happy, middle-class white family with blonde-haired and blue-eyed children. All your dolls look like that, too, and every day, you see how white kids are treated better, by everyone; teachers, shopkeepers, even your own mother, who keeps their house. Morrison chose the most vulnerable protagonist she could imagine—an ugly young black girl from a broken home—to showcase how this internalized racism has a destructive impact one's self-worth, promoting instead a sense of self-hatred. This isn't unique to Pecola, but a recurring issue for all the black characters, who feed the cycle of violence by dumping their feelings of shame and the resulting aggression on the most readily available target to lift themselves up; poor Pecola, who's at the bottom of the social ladder. She is ignored, neglected, teased, mocked, wrongfully accused of guilt, ultimately raped... yet despite all that, Morrison does a fantastic job at not overly demonizing those who perpetrate these acts.
""All of our waste which we dumped on her and which she absorbed. And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. All of us—all who knew her—felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even her waking dreams we used—to silence our own nightmares. And she let us, and thereby deserved our contempt. We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength.And fantasy it was, for we were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good, but well behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life. We substituted good grammar for intellect; we switched habits to simulate maturity; we rearranged lies and called it truth, seeing in the new pattern of an old idea the Revelation and the Word.""
Pecola desperately wishes for blue eyes, which she equates with beauty and whiteness, and all the advantages light skin comes with. I find the title in the superlative and singular form an interesting choice—perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but I believe that ""eye"" is an intended play on words, being a homophone of ""I"". Blue is a color associated with both innocence and sadness, and the most innocent, saddest person in this book surely applies to the little girl who wants nothing more than to be pretty. Poor, unfortunate Pecola, who doesn't even realize that it's not beauty she really wants, but to be treated with love, kindness, or at least dignity.
""Guileless and without vanity, we were still in love with ourselves then. We felt comfortable in our own skins, enjoyed the news that our senses released to us, admired our dirt, cultivated our scars, and could not comprehend this unworthiness.""
4.5 stars rounded down because I found two plot points to be over the top and ultimately unnecessary in the grand scheme of the book's message, but, as all of Morrison's work, this features exquisite, lyrical prose, yet is an uncomfortable, upsetting, painfully honest story that offers no escapism, but forces you to take a good hard look at terrible, tragic truths you'd rather look away from.Show more"

Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion.”Dealing mostly with the theme of internalised racism, ‘The Bluest Eye’ by Godess Toni Morrison may well be one of the saddest books I’ve read all year. Hitting you right in the bleakness of the late 20’s Midwest, the story is told by a minor character, Claudia, as she innocently recalls her friend Pecola’s childhood and the events that make up her life.Split into four sections detailing each season, Morrison cleverly uses the passage of time to introduce and examine some of the characters who make up Pecola’s life in greater detail, as we meet her mother, father and even the sex workers who live upstairs. In other hands, this may be a relatively simple story, but Morrison fleshes our the narrative with a wide range of side characters who all affect Pecola’s story in a different way, whether that be through kindness, or (sadly) abuse.I have to say that Morrison handles the story brilliantly, not only digging into race in general but encapsulating certain themes also. Claudia, for instance, is disgusted when Pecola’s says she wishes her eyes were blue - emphasising the social context of a white characteristic being a standard of beauty for these girls and the harsh reality of life in the Midwest at the time (while also showing how certain things still have a lot of changing to do).Overall, honestly couldn’t have gone better with my first bit of Morrison, and I’ll be continuing through her works chronologically from this point on 😊5 freaking stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ Show more"

I don’t know if I’ve read a book with quite the same structure, a first person narrative threading through with feistiness and hardscrabble love as a foil to the disintegration of Pecola’s family and life, while only occupying a small portion of the narrative. But even the disintegrating characters are rich with detail and personality, or at least story.Show more"

Nope. No. Absolutely not!! How this book is considered a “classic” as well as proper reading material for middle school or high school children is beyond me. Hell no. Perhaps I wouldn’t be rating this book so low, if it wasn’t hailed as a “classic” and required for school curriculums? If people think ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ should be banned from schools because it has the “n*****” word in it, but this book is totally okay and should be read for actual school curriculums, needs their heads examined.This book is straight up normalizing physical abuse, sexual abuse, incest, and pedophilia within black communities. I get what Toni Morrison was trying to relate with the true underlying meaning behind her book, but she completely ruined the significance behind that message with the constant unnecessary lewd and sexual details of children being raped and/or molested. Sex was literally the entire focus of the whole book. And not just “normal” sex. Full on thoughts from a religious man rationalizing that it’s okay that he’s attracted to little girls and enjoys molesting them, to fathers who are suddenly hot and bothered for their young daughters and proceeds to rape them (in detail mind you), to…. Well, you get the gist. 😳😳 Like… whaaat?!And then the way all of the adults in this book (mothers, fathers, neighbors) never showed any real parental love or support towards any of their children. It was like having the author trying to explain to “white people” that black people just don’t see their children as beautiful as they do white children, and that they let their children know that. That’s pretty disturbing if that’s how this author truly felt back when she wrote this. Every chapter felt like it was explaining that every black person thought that they themselves and their children were “ugly.” Umm… no. Just no. I’m gonna give black people more credit than Toni Morrison. Cuz, some the stuff she writes in this are just plain sick.Also, the question I want to ask Toni is, “So, is this a community issue or a societal issue?” Because, what I just read sounds like it’s a straight up a community issue. I know I’ll probably get a ton of hate for my review. But, in all honesty, if I was black person reading this book, I think I would be really upset. It would make me feel like we’re just all monsters with nothing but evil sexual thoughts, that we have no problem seeing our neighbors and friends abuse their children, and that every single one of us is just down right ugly, including our own children.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

Little white girl playing with her Barbie in Saigon vs. little Black girl losing her deserved childhood innocence in Lorain, Ohio, USA. Nope. I needed to get through Pecola's story, as gruesome as it was.Cholly Breedlove and Soaphead Church--Morrison developed their characters very well, I think. I can't understand what makes them tick nor do I want to.Pecola's drive to have blue eyes instead of brown broke my heart. She was so beautiful to me in this story--the ugliness of her circumstances I saw submerging her into a collected opinion from the community that she herself was ugly. I was intrigued to read Morrison's book because of Pecola's desire for blue eyes. I picked up an unspoken definition of beauty from growing up in the early 1980s that white skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes solely defined beauty. Oh yeah, and extreme thinness. I remember Barbie doll commercials from back then where Barbie was front and center and Christie was behind her or on the very edge of the frame. Was Christie inferior? Was she not pretty or as pretty as Barbie? Of course, she was not inferior nor lacking beauty but as a child I did not know what to think. Christie's placement in the print and TV ads made a huge impression upon me.It's a masterful book but not for the faint of heart.Show more"

Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question. The master had said, 'You are ugly people.' They had looked about themselves saw nothing to contradict the statement; saw, in fact, support for it leaning at them from every billboard, every movie, every glance.The Bluest Eye is a careful, patient dissection of a tragedy - a dissection so extensive that the reader eventually finds themselves cut open and exposed. At the center of the story is Pecola Breedlove, a black girl who desperately wants to have the blue eyes that the world around her has matter-of-factly accepted as the ideal of beauty. This desire is emblematic of a vulnerability that other characters exploit again and again. We observe Pecola through the eyes of another child in her town, as well as through the histories of her parents and other adults. As the reader reassembles the pieces of the story, it becomes apparent that every thorn of cruelty grew out of a vast and tangled thicket of nightmares, confusion, and regret. Morrison's writing is elegant and precise, even when describing terrible things. It throws a sharp light on the ongoing harm done by homogeneous ideals about what goodness and beauty ought to look like.Show more"

Where does it come from? Who enables it?How is it infectious?What might be the consequences?Through Pecola’s story, we see that self-hatred is taught by those closest to her and reinforced by the world around her. The characters in her story have their own trauma which does not justify but explain how this young black girl’s sense of self could never blossom, only erode into madness.In the forward to the novel, Morrison explains she broke up the narrative to force readers not to pity Pecola, but to interrogate their role in her demise. In hindsight, she is unsatisfied with this decision because most readers “remained touched but not moved”—to which I say this is likely the only time I will ever disagree with Toni Morrison. I think this structure achieved—at least for me—exactly what she set out to do. ‘The Bluest Eye’ examines how everyone in her life, including the reader piecing her story together, is culpable in the death of her spirit.Show more"

We are wrong, of course, but it doesn’t matter. It’s too late.”Toni Morrison captures the tragic cruelty of life so honestly and sharply. In this novel, we witness how the foundations of self-hatred are set up by the racial prejudices of society. We principally follow the little girl Pecola who is deceived into believing herself ugly and consequently desires blue eyes to make her beautiful. Morrison tells us the facts of racism, of misogyny, of prejudice, but not through statements. She interweaves fragments of different lives and different times to reveal the brutal truth of humanity’s cruelty, the truth which only few acknowledge.

This is a novel too monstrous and perverse it has left me cold and nauseated but with exceedingly brilliant intentions. It scrapes the skin until it finds the time to burrow underneath it. It squirms then stings like a fresh, bleeding wound washed by running water from a faucet. My mind still reels not only from how painful and horrific it all is but also with the thought-provokingly cascaded perspectives from multiple point of views.“There is nothing more to say—except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.”What struck me most is the internalised racism in The Bluest Eye which most of the characters manoeuvre in. It is recognisably and frighteningly merciless. In a society that deeply favours Eurocentric features it does an endless amount of harm, especially on women, through the self-hatred it cultivates on the nonconformists. With the word “ugly” dropped objectively, rigidly, and bitterly multiple times, it further widens the already existing rift within minority groups, particularly between black American girls / women here; where in differing shades of black, perhaps even considered better facial symmetry, the lighter ones expectedly get nicer treatment and privilege whilst the darker ones receive damaging taunts and teases. Morrison is compelling and vivid; poetic and poignant. There is never a word wasted. The self-hatred intensifies resulting in an immense need to take any kind of love in whatever—frequently malleable and deceitful—shape or form it presents itself as; and the difficulty to leave these abusive relationships is rooted from unaddressed insecurities and traumas. The body is constantly used, objectified, and bruised. Poverty gives additional weight to the inability to accept the possibility of freedom. But it is hard to recognise love as true and tender when prior loves experienced amount to nothing. As The Bluest Eye traverses the complications of established notions on physical beauty, it microscopes on dysfunctional family units of a race continuously oppressed where, brutally, oppression also thrives. A number of people may feel the violence in The Bluest Eye is unnecessary and excessive but this opens an important discourse not only on rape culture but also domestic violence and child abuse. These mostly remain unreported due to families and friends doubting the victim, that or turning a blind eye over issues they don’t want to confront once learned. Until the end, the novel is fraught with despair. Hope is nowhere in sight. There is a maddening guilt and self-blame that looms all over the pages. And the ugliest is the pleasure and self-confidence people derive in comparing themselves to the unfortunate ones. Childhood innocence here slips and fleets. It is eventually crushed by the hands of corruption. The Bluest Eye is covered in grit and dirt; in blood and violation. It turns your head and makes you see what's often disregarded: the physical scars go but the emotional ones don’t.Show more"

With Morrison, you anticipate a dreamlike and often nightmarish immersion into the American past that is seldom spoke of. Poverty, racism, tension and abuse surround the scenes. The trauma is so deep that a need for an supernatural alternative reality is offered to allow the victims periodic escapes from the weight of the inescapable clutches of a cruel world. Ghosts, waking dreams and unnatural phenomena are part of the Morrison alternative reality. In this book, the primary character is a 12-year-old girl Pecola. Her short life has been filled with humiliation, shame and a continuation and acceleration of her mother and father's troubled childhood and life. As a young toddler, she is gifted a plastic doll with blond hair and blue eyes. Disturbed with this strange toy, she rejects the foreign, hard and unfamiliar icon. Over time she understands how race classifies and sets the value in our society. She wishes she too had blue eyes.Morrison has a unique voice and this book is no exception. She uses a Faulknerian change of narration that is brilliant and disorienting. It works well and we see different views of Pecola and her mother and father's lives. The events where these characters are dehumanized are vivid and shocking. Just as the characters are old enough to understand identity and injustice, they experience these without rhyme or reason. Adult figures are their abusers. Many are family and friends.Morrison is never simplistic. She does not shy away from difficult topics. She challenges the reader to think harder. She stirs up a reader's emotions and mixes in fantasy and escapism to allow the reader to process the difficult scenes. The answers may exist somewhere in the hazy, spiraling scenes, but there are no simple solutions. Pecola is a tragic figure and represents the accumulation of hurts endured as generation after generation of children experience harm at the hands of elders. These elders are the broken adults who have suffered their own humiliation when they were young. They are tormented by the image of the still innocent children who remind them of themselves before they were broken. The innocence of the children send the adults back to the trauma that smashed their worlds. Like a frustrated artist who is tortured by a beauty of a masterpiece, they are driven to destroy the beauty rather than suffer through the painful reminders of what has been lost and cannot be regained. Morrison's voice is brilliant and idiosyncratic. She can magnify and depict a scene with intense vividness and then send the reader on a mystical, transcendent dream sequence. Her originality is inspiring. I enjoyed this book better than the more sinister ""Beloved"" and equally to the masterful ""Song of Solomon"". She is highly experimental and her genius is evident in this first novel.

It was just 200 pages, but took me a couple of days to get through because the subject matter was heavy and her writing is always dense and layered. I actually found the writing her a little more accessible here than in my first Morrison book, Beloved. I more often felt I knew what was happening, and that the action wasn't lost in the poetry. The narrative style was a bit strange. It kind of bounced around in the story it was telling and in the style in which it was telling that story. At the very end, the whole took a turn into the very difficult and gross. It was never an easy read, but by the end, I felt my skin crawling. I think in parts it lacked a bit of cohesion. Take that criticism with a grain of salt, however, because this felt important to read. I saw a few of my own identity struggles reflected in Pecola's wish to have blue eyes. It's easy to say that this story doesn't have the same weight it did 30 years ago because these conversations happen more frequently in some sections of our society. I can't speak for a whole, but on a personal level, I had experiences in my school years where people said things to me like, ""he doesn't date black girls"" or ""you won't be cast in the play because you are dark."" Society's notions of beauty haven't changed THAT much, and many of us who are still young, can probably relate to the way Pecola was meant to feel lesser. The most amazing thing to me, though, was that the story of beauty was at the surface, but soon Morrison was discussing issues of racism, class, the cycle of poverty and abuse and disappointed hopes and lack of privilege. It spiraled from this one wish, for blue eyes, and soon encapsulated so many other struggles. Definitely a worthwhile read. Show more"

From the clucking sounds of adults I knew that the doll represented what they thought was my fondest wish. I was bemused with the thing itself, and the way it looked. What was I supposed to do with it? Pretend I was its mother? I had no interest in babies or the concept of motherhood. I was interested only in humans my own age and size, and could not generate any enthusiasm at the prospect of being a mother”. Do you believe that we consciously or unconsciously put our insecurities on others?? That we are so busy trying to make ourselves feel good that we hurt others or spend so much time patching ourselves up that we ignore what we are capable of giving to others? The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison is outstanding. She finds a way to tell stories within stories that connects back to the false notion that white is the closest thing to perfect. That having white features or “acting white” would automatically make life that much better, but then again, what would a person do to make that notion happen? “They were big, white, armed men. He was small, black, helpless. His subconscious knew what his conscious mind did not guess — that hating them would have consumed him, burned him up like a piece of soft coal, leaving only flakes of ash and a question mark of smoke”.Pecola is a young child who is both poor and unloved because of both her appearance and the struggle of her parents. We never hear Pecola’s point of view, only others opinion and experience that leads to the tragedy of Pecola’s life. She is portrayed as ugly and is unloved by the very people who created her. Toni Morrison gives a voice to children who feel small in a crowded room. Children who are received as too ugly or too black or too poor to be seen. I will say this though, this is story that should not be read once and put down. I will revisit it again because there is still so much sealed in these pages.Show more"

Each one was brutal and heart-breaking and incredibly moving, and all three work very well individually, but also complement each other nicely.The Bluest Eye is the oldest work of the three, and the only work of fiction, but felt every bit as modern, as raw, and as real as the other two. It also has the largest scope in that it looks at a community, at family, centered around Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl who wants nothing more than to have blue eyes and blonde hair so she can be seen as pretty in a society that continually puts forth a white, blue eyed and blonde hair image of beauty (particularly in dolls, a potent message to young girls). The novel tracks the way that systemic injustices infect a series of lives by just infecting one - someone who is hurt and humiliated by white men turns into a person who hurts and humiliates others, who then bear that hurt and humiliation, etc. Again, it's not really for me to speak to the content, beyond to express dismay at the brutality so inherent in Amercia's history (as well as its present), and the way these prejudices have perpetuated in so many different forms. Morrison's prose left me awe-struck. This was the first of her works that I've read, but I'm sure to seek out more again soon.Show more"

I have no right to “review” it, only to respond to it. There are many academic, passionate, sociologically intelligent and brilliant reviews and analyses of The Bluest Eye, and so I leave that burden with those who can add to that conversation. Herein, I am simply a human responding – I am a woman, past my sixth decade, having grown children and growing grands. One reads a story of this type and falls into the characters with ease – that is the magic and beauty of Toni Morrison’s skill in writing. One is immediately in the milieu of the children, of the neighbors, the parents, the combatants. Horrifically, one even understands to some degree one allows oneself, the rapist, abuser, the one laying stripes on a child. One reads with a dry mouth, an unuttered gasp, with held breath. And every so often one’s head droops. One weeps.The last words are read, are heard. The silence thereafter is heavy and full of relief. Until one begins to ponder one’s own experiences. It stuns me to have a bubble-up from my memories. I knew a girl once. Quite like Pecola, with a father, exactly like Cholly. And here’s the thing: blue eyes don’t stop the nightmare from happening. Haven’t ever. I am gripped with ?horror? ?regret? ?shame? All are dead now. But they swirl about just the same, in the aftermath of this read.

Numa sociedade em que a Shirley Temple, atriz-mirim, loira de olhos azuis, é considerada o modelo de beleza, Cláudia, a narradora, uma menina negra e pobre de Ohio,não consegue compreender o fascínio que a beleza ""branca"" exerce sobre seus semelhantes. Desconhece os motivos de todos acreditarem que uma boneca branca é o sonho de toda criança. Nesse seu estranhamento, ela desmembra bonecas para compreender o que há por dentro delas, o que causa essa comoção em todos.Porém, esse livro não foca em Cláudia, o ponto principal, na minha opinião, é Pecola. Uma menina negra, considerada feia até mesmo por sua mãe, que acredita que se tivesse olhos azuis ela seria bonita, seria mais feliz.

The story is told from different perspectives of people who are connected to Pecola and are cause of above mentioned abuse due misplaced frustration, anger, and disappointment that has been caused by their own trauma. What Toni Morrison does so disturbingly well is that she doesn't let the reader off the hook when it comes to terrible or despicable actions of characters but rather dives into their emotions and motivations instead of straight up demonizing them (I’ve also noticed this in the two other fiction novels I’ve read by her so far: Beloved and God Help The Child).•4/5 ⭐️Show more"

I have been a reader all my life and took so many lit classes in college and somehow I have never had the opportunity to read this book until now.This book begins in 1941 and is the story of Pecola. However, the book changes points-of-view throughout the story. One of the points-of-view is Claudia, the daughter of Pecola’s foster parents. Pecola is placed in foster care after her father burns down their house. Pecola’s circumstances have made her believe that she is ugly and she desires blue eyes. With blue eyes, she will beautiful like the other white girls in her city.This is a relatively short novel, at only 200 pages but it makes its point. This book discusses race, internalized racism, abuse, class, family, and innocence. This novel is tragic. This book shows just how awful and cruel racism is. Pecola is ashamed of her skin and her looks because society tells her that the most beautiful girls have blonde hair and blue eyes. This has an impact on how she views herself and more importantly her worth. This book was published in 1970 and our society still portrays beauty in that way. We need to do better as a society so every girl feels beautiful, comfortable, and worthy in her own skin.There is also the themes of sexual assault. The sexual abuse that Pecola endures is extremely difficult to read. The hurt and pain, along with the shame and loss of innocence is described extremely well.The points-of-view changes did through me off a few times, but they are a necessary part of the story. This isn’t a “light” read. It will weigh heavily on your heart, but you need to pay attention and learn. The prose is outstanding. I can honestly say I have never read anything like it. It flows perfectly. I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend this read and will be purchasing more Toni Morrison books in the future.Show more"

Using a bastardized form of the “All-American” Dick, Jane & Sally early readers, Morrison poetically reconstructs poor Black family lives, finding the psychological and physical wounds that predate even the characters’ lives and inform who and how they become. It’s masterful and necessary, as, at the time that she wrote this Nobel-prize-winning novel (1970), white culture had censored out just about everything in these lives that then turned on themselves. And even the censoring is represented in the wounding here—the desire for blue eyes.Toward the end of the book there is a character who “was suffering from and enjoying an invincible melancholy. . . . how important his melancholy was to him, that he was very interested in altering her joy to a more academic gloom . . .

So we see a steady production of broken humans. Even the idea of living in a world where your very existence is questioned every breathing moment is harrowing. How traumatic it would be to live such a life, where the violence is furthered inside home too, because trauma is a never ending cycle. There is a constant absence of a male figure in the familial bonding. More often than not the absence in physical, but in spite of the physical presence, the absence of emotional support is a constant. Emotional abandonment, however, is not merely confined to fathers only but also in mothers. The withdrawal of emotional support often followed by infliction of physical violence. The mothers trying to restore their own self esteem, lost first at work at the hands of whites and later through their husbands, by relieving it on those below them, aka, their children. And so we see the birth of a vicious cycle of violence resulting in the complete destruction of familial harmony and social balancing. “Quiet as it is kept…” is how the book begins promising the divulging of some well kept secret. Some reminiscent of trauma or shame or both. In the Afterword of the book Morrison writes,“Further, in addition to its “back fence” connotation, its suggestion of illicit gossip, of thrilling revelation, there is also, in the “whisper,” the assumption (on the part of the reader) that the teller is on the inside, knows something others do not, and is going to be generous with this privileged information.”Black children are the most oppressed in the social hierarchy; being left by the fathers sometimes right after their birth and emotionally abandoned and physically assaulted by mothers while growing up, blamed by the society for their own rape at the age of 12 at the hands of their fathers, berated by their own mother in front of a white child, their existence completely made to feel invisible by a white shop keeper. The world of black child is full of void; empty of familial bonds, love, care, and social standing. Even lower in the pyramid is the girl child. They are either invisible or a nuisance for both family and society. Hence Morrison tried to give voice, voice to the previously unheard, mostly invisible beings. And yet it is not the sound of laughter of children playing, nor it is a picture of warmth; it’s rather a depiction of learning to survive from the get go. First against their own family and then against the society. Although black boys are not absent from the narrative, but they are the enablers. The perpetrators who enable the system the little girls are crushed in. They are drunkards, rapists, paedophiles, they are absconders or just simply absent from the lives of their children. Emotional violence is not perpetuated by the mere absence of love and kindness, but it is aired further by shoving white beauty standards down their throats. Girls could either respond in self-loathing, or self preservation. We see a glimpse of both in The Bluest Eye. Claudia, our nine year old narrator hates white dolls. She reflects her utter disgust at receiving them at Christmas by ripping them apart with her bare hands. Whereas Pecola, 11 year old, whose story we are being told, hates herself and shows it by pleading to god to grant her with blue eyes, a metaphor for white standards of beauty. Morrison’s girls do not grow older nor they grow in character. If anything their life is only deteriorating all along. Hence Pecola’s pleas go unheard, and the childhood is lost at the hands of her own father.The Bluest Eye is the midst of a wasteland. Marigolds do not grow, the baby doesn’t live. Pecola’s life is devoid of any system or harmony, within herself or with the society. Her survival is constantly at stake, at the hands of beating mother, the kids at school who either bully her or negate her very existence, and finally at the hands of her father, who raped her. The sheer absence of life in her body could be constantly felt. The seasons are mocking life. It was in spring (a season of rebirth) when the eleven ywar old is raped becomes pregnant.

The story of Pecola Breedlove resonated deeply with my own experiences growing up, feeling alone, friendly but constantly battling the cruel words that echoed in my mind, especially those that came from my mother and my peers. Pecola’s longing for blue eyes and my childhood wish for straight hair, to be a lighter Black girl and a skinnier frame are reflections of the same desire— to be seen as beautiful and to be loved.When I first read this novel in middle school, its profound messages eluded my young mind. I knew it was important; our teachers emphasized its significance, but the depth of its impact only became clear as I revisited it years later. Now, I understand why they wanted us to read this book. It’s not just a story; it’s a mirror showing us the painful truths about our society and ourselves.Pecola’s story is a harrowing tale of a young Black girl growing up in the 1940s, a time when beauty was synonymous with whiteness. She is subjected to relentless ridicule and abuse, both at home and in her community, leading her to internalize these hateful messages. Pecola believes that if only she had blue eyes, the epitome of beauty, her life would be different—better, even. As a child, I too wished for features I did not have. I wanted straight hair, believing it would make me prettier, and I longed to be skinnier, thinking it would make me more acceptable to those around me. The cruelty I faced, much like Pecola’s, made me feel isolated and unworthy.One of the most heart-wrenching aspects of Pecola’s story is her relationship with her mother. Pecola’s mother, Pauline, showers more affection on the white family she works for than on her own daughter. Pauline’s harshness and neglect towards Pecola reminded me painfully of my own experiences. My mother, too, often told me I was ugly. These words cut deep and lingered, shaping how I saw myself and the world around me. Pecola’s suffering is a stark reminder of the power of a parent’s words and actions, and the lasting scars they can leave.As Pecola becomes pregnant by her own father, the older women in the community judge her harshly instead of offering support and compassion. This judgment further isolates Pecola, compounding her trauma and shame. This reaction from the older women underscores the critical need for adults to do better at protecting and loving Black girls, providing them with the emotional safety they need to love themselves.Morrison’s writing in 'The Bluest Eye' is nothing short of breathtaking. Her words had my heart fluttering, as she masterfully captured the innocence and devastation of Pecola’s world. The novel’s themes of racism, beauty standards, and the devastating impact of neglect and abuse on children are conveyed with such grace and power. Morrison shows us how deeply rooted racism and colorism are, and how they poison the minds of those who are most vulnerable.Adults have a profound responsibility to protect and nurture children, both emotionally and physically. 'The Bluest Eye' serves as a poignant call to action, especially for the care and protection of Black girls. Pecola’s tragedy is a failure of the community as much as it is a personal one. Every adult in her life fails her in some way, highlighting the dire need for better support systems and more compassionate care for our children.The novel also explores the destructive nature of societal beauty standards. Pecola’s yearning for blue eyes symbolizes the internalization of racism and the belief that whiteness is the standard of beauty. This is a destructive ideology that still permeates society today. Children, especially Black girls, need to be told and shown that they are beautiful as they are, that their natural features are to be celebrated, not scorned.Toni Morrison’s 'The Bluest Eye' is a powerful, heartrending novel that continues to resonate deeply. It’s a story that made me cry and still brings tears to my eyes as I reflect on Pecola’s pain and my own childhood. It is a reminder of the need for empathy, understanding, and unwavering support for our children. As I close this book, I am left with a renewed sense of purpose to advocate for a world where every child feels valued and beautiful, just as they are. This novel is more than just a story; it’s a beacon of truth and a call for change.Show more"

I read it in parts and mostly heard the audio. On comparing the two, I find the audio performance very good, I always prefer reading. This is a story about a seven year old African girl (Pecola) who wishes to have the bluest eye (like those of the pretty, blond, blue eyed American girls). It was Pecola’s attempt to recreate her identity, to conform, to be appreciated and to calm the self abhorrence. Yet, the story is not about her, it’s a symbolic representation of the devastation of psyche of all those who face discrimination of any kind (racial discrimination in this context) at the hands of others who relish the entrancing yet shallow fantasy of being superior. It prise opened emotions that were repressed due to guilt or self pity. It makes you reflect on your prejudiced acts, if ever performed or the sentiments of self pity at being bullied, loathed, or simply ignored in a social context. Morrison’s writing is pellucid yet, unnerving. Her observations and reflections on the social conventions are brilliant. An example is her interpretation of the 'adults sharing a gossip' is a conspiracy which is both held and exposed against one’s own people. It will potentially remind you of the scars that each one of us, knowingly perform and deliberately suppress the conscious acknowledgement of, to spare ourselves of guilt. And it is through our lamented injustices that society is divided into blacks, whites, filthy, rich, poor, beggars, untouchables, villagers and the like. I could while reading, draw parallels with the writings of Munshi Premchand whose prose and content differed from that of Morrison’s, while they shared the concept of divisions in our society cultivated, protected and transferred to generations. With a few exceptions, some conditions still exist in India and of which everyone is a part including myself. This story brought these thoughts to the brim of my consciousness and gave me strength to write about it, is the mark of an effectual impact of this book. Equally poignant is Morrison’s ""in your grill"" message of the cruel, incomprehensibility of life and the powerlessness of the child in an adult world. Children hear, follow, eavesdrop on partly comprehensible adult conversations, bear punishments, accommodate aberrations to their egos made by their own wise parents and recover from them… alone, uncertain, confused and without ever having the slightest conception of the great big WHY. It is best depicted in the instances where Claudia and Freida talk about sex and conception, their craving for love, bearing insult at being beaten up by their frustrated parents for a trivial reason of being sick. In writing the story, Morrison’s attempt to charatersketch and detail the lives of Pecola’s parents that paved way for her destruction is much appreciated. The reader comes to understand that the roots of all brawls, contests and discontentment lie in one’s past. And I believe that we must allow the wounds to heal lest it should breed hatred and destruction which may not operate on a battle ground but in the mundane exchanges. A disappoint with the book was that the flow of the story was interrupted by the author’s desperation to discuss some observations and disclose all of her ideas. The story was scattered and much was left to the reader to weave the segments into a structured whole. The impact of the story rose and stagnated; hence I gave it 4 stars. However, I strongly recommend this book. Show more"

Dù đã từng đọc và vô cùng yêu thích “Giết Con Chim Nhại” nhưng phải đến “Mắt Nào Xanh Nhất“, tôi mới cảm thấy mình thực sự chạm vào đề tài này. Nếu Harper Lee khiến lương tâm và đạo đức con người lấp lánh toả sáng trong tiểu thuyết của mình, thì Toni Morrison cho độc giả thử một lần đứng bên trong bầu không khí ngột ngạt đặc quánh mờ tối mà những người da đen đã sống trong nó, để tự mình thương tổn, đau đớn, tuyệt vọng rồi (phần nào) thấu hiểu.Đọc xong cuốn này, tôi đã không còn thắc mắc (và có lúc từng khó chịu) về sự nhạy cảm của người da đen nữa. Trước đây tôi đã từng lạ lẫm, tại sao họ lại nhạy cảm đến thế trước bất cứ một vấn đề gì liên quan đến màu da sắc tộc, có cần thiết phải thế không? Mà không để tâm rằng, sự nhạy cảm đó đã được hình thành qua biết bao thập kỉ, qua biết bao trầy xước tâm hồn, từ thế hệ tổ tiên cha ông họ. Và điều đó được lí giải khi mỗi chương sách đi qua những mốc thời gian và không gian khác nhau, hé mở cho độc giả sự bắt nguồn, hình thành nhân cách của từng nhân vật liên quan đến Pecola. Đó là người cha Cholly trở nên vô cảm vì xuất thân mồ côi bị ruồng bỏ, là người mẹ Pauline từ bé đã luôn cảm thấy bản thân quá xấu xí, là Claudia & Frieda - hai cô bạn ở trong một gia đình da đen bình yên hơn, nhưng vẫn có những tổn hại riêng v.v..Tôi thích cái suy nghĩ và thế giới trẻ thơ thi thoảng lại tràn đầy trang sách, đó là những điều đơn giản đầy ngạc nhiên. Pecola cùng chị em Claudia & Frieda trìu mến chơi với nhau, thể hiện với nhau cách nhìn, ước mơ của riêng mình và bảo vệ nhau. Một cảm giác trong lành. Nhưng rồi chính cái trong lành đó lại đến lúc thật đau lòng khi nó tương phản với những gì cô bé Pecola phải hứng chịu từ người lớn, từ những ngược đãi đáng kinh tởm, và từ sự vô cảm của xã hội. “Cái chết của lòng tự trọng có thể diễn ra nhanh chóng, dễ dàng ở trẻ con, trước khi bản ngã của chúng có chân”, Pecola trong sáng giống như một hạt mầm lương thiện bị tước đi quyền được nảy nở. Và quá trình ấy như thế nào thì xin dành để bạn tự đi vào chi tiết và có những rung cảm thật cá nhân khi đọc sách nhé.Rồi bạn sẽ biết, tại sao ước mơ có một đôi mắt màu xanh nước biển lại là một ước mơ đau lòng.Ở Lời tựa, tác giả có chia sẻ về bắt nguồn ý tưởng cho “Mắt Nào Xanh Nhất”, giải thích về cấu trúc, dụng ý của cách triển khai tác phẩm, giúp người đọc hiểu sâu hơn.

It deals with racism, particularly internalised racism, and the toll that can take on Black people. It's a really thought-provoking book, but wasn't one that I loved.The structure is interesting. Morrison breaks it down into four seasons, each focusing initially on the narrator of the story, an observer of events, and then moving to focus more closely on Pecola, the Black girl who longs for blue eyes, or one of her parents, or someone in the community that Pecola has some relationship with. There's a lot of focus on her parents. Morrison wants to show how internalised racism influenced them and made them the people they are, which influenced how they treated Pecola. She's eager not to demonise the parents, and the other Black characters, and I think that's the right choice: she shows them as victims of a racist system, whose results are absolutely heartbreaking in this book.The desire for blue eyes signals the desire and love for whiteness, which Pecola feels, but is also felt by the narrator's sister, Frieda. It's signified by the love of Shirley Temple and the distinction between 'coloured' and a racial slur that some Black people make to equate themselves with white families. We see the narrator, Claudia, try to navigate the hatred for Blackness and the love of whiteness, rejecting it and embracing it. It's heartbreaking that Pecola feels that if only she had blue eyes, she would be loveable: if only she were white, she would be loveable, and this belief has been instilled in her by the world at large and her own people.I really liked the discussions Morrison was having in this book. The idea of internalised racism is something that we need to be more aware of, especially white people. We need to be mindful about how our impact on the world is adopted by people of colour, who don't see enough representations of beauty in their own image. We white people have a lot to do to help normalise different cultural representations, so that people of colour don't grow up feeling like how they look is not beautiful, or not normal. The effect of that feeling in this book is heartbreaking.Be aware that there is paedophilia, rape, and incest in this novel, as well as pregnancy resulting from incestuous rape. There is also madness resulting from this rape and other traumas inflicted on this character.Definitely a book worth reading as we continue the discussion of systemic racism, but it's not an easy read.Show more"

It gives a detailed and heartbreaking insight into racialised beauty standards, self-loathing and how it especially effected and still effects black women and girls. It goes a lot into the dehumanisation of black people and how white beauty standards influenced how black girls were seen and saw themselves. This was really difficult to read just because it was such a tragic and sad story, however a very beautiful book that I would say is an important read if you want to learn about beauty standards and racism. While the book does have a main character it follows a range of different characters and how their past influenced their current actions which I found really interesting to read about. 'There in the dark her memory was refreshed, and she succumbed to her earlier dreams. Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap. She forgot lust and simple caring for. She regarded love as possessive mating, and romance as the goal of the spirit. It would be for her a well-spring from which she would draw the most destructive emotions, deceiving the lover and seeking to imprison the beloved, curtailing freedom in every way.''You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source.

It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.'Show more"

Through the Breedlove family, Morrison explores the heavy toll of generational trauma, racial demonization, and unimaginable self-hatred. In Pecola, it can be seen how these dangerous waters, in the absence of support systems and barricades, can gradually erode a small child's sense of self and lead to intense self-loathing. Her demand for blue eyes is matter-of-fact and wistful, grotesque, and obscene. It is horrifying to see how easily one can go on a path of no return in a world that is doing its best to dehumanize, how easily one can lash out and hurt one's own. So things move towards falling apart. I must point out Morrison's economy of language. She deftly balances restraint and excess, her frequent lyrical abstractions never feel strained or laboured.The Foreword & the Afterword provided an astute glimpse into Morrison's mind & thought process. She readily admits that she was no longer satisfied by her chosen structure or language. So if I must nitpick, I feel Pecola was not centered enough in the narrative. It tended to wander around a lot but I don't mind as it led to superb sections. I was impressed by how Morrison subverted the Dick and Jane books, the ideal white family vs the 'real' black family. Claudia as a narrator was intrusive, but her family contrasted brilliantly with the Breedlove family. It's a nearly perfect novel, extraordinary.Show more"

We have also all looked in the mirror and seen only things we thought of as flaws. Because we have these experiences we can have compassion for Morrison's character, Pecola Breedlove.And yet, how many of us have been rejected by the entire world for something as unchangeable as the color of our skin? How many of us want a different color eyes because we think it will make us appear lighter skinned? That blue eyes are such a trait of white people that having them will mean that we are at least partly white.Pecola Breedlove lives in a world that tells her that being white is superior. The book takes place during the 1940s in Ohio. I live in Colorado in 2020 -- 70 years have passed since Pecola -- how much has changed? I worry that it's far too little.In The Bluest Eye we first meet nine year old Claudia MacTeer and her ten year old sister, Frieda. Their family struggles to make end meet, but still take in Pecola Breedlove after her father burned down the family home and goes to prison. Pecola believes that she is ugly and wants blue eyes. There is a local man who claims that he can work miracles, and Pecola goes to him to ask for blue eyes...This story is devastatingly sad. It is tragic. And yet the voice is smart, nuanced and beautiful. There is an element of hope and the writing is impeccable.In an Afterward the author explains that she wanted to make a statement about the damage that internalized racism can do to the most vulnerable member of a community—a young girl. I would say that she met her goal. I am a middle-aged white woman and she certainly showed me. This is a beautiful book.Show more"

Even though it is short, it is full of triggers and no one walks away feeling happy. I was lucky enough to get hold of a version that includes an author's preface, so I got to see Morrison's own words showing me how to process the story. (I skimmed before reading the novel, and then I re-read the preface closely after the novel finished, because I needed help.)The author herself describes The Bluest Eye as a ""bleak narrative of psychological murder."" Author's project ""was to enter the life of the one least likely to withstand such damaging forces because of youth, gender, and race."" So much anger in this book. And the author turned so much anger against her own community, which was extremely bold, given this book was published in the 1960s.No escape from ugliness here. Author really did not want to ""comfort"" her readers. She wants us to ""interrogate ourselves,"" to make ourselves see the damage that results when we hurt other people.Morrison also brings up a question where I have no room to comment, but I found it extremely puzzling. She names the idea of ""racial self-contempt,"" which honestly I have no idea such a thing was possible. All I know is that I feel a deep-seated guilt and perhaps a dash of shame that's related to white privilege. Like I want to have the words ""I'm sorry"" tattooed on my face when I see someone less priveleged than myself. But now Toni Morrison suggests that maybe self-hatred is a human condition? I dunno. I'll believe whatever Toni Morrison tells me, after I'm finished my daily mantra of ""sorry""s.Show more"

The storyline is compelling and the subject matters covered are grave indeed. This is not a tale for the weak-hearted. Prejudice, poverty, neglect, mental, physical and sexual abuse, incest, pedophilia, it's all there, crammed into a relatively slim volume.Given the ""weightiness"" of the subject matter, it's strange that the book failed to move me, surprising even. The story is told from the viewpoints of numerous people who happened to be in her life while, off-hand, I can only remember one part where it's told from her own perspective. There is not enough focus on the main character. As a result, I found it difficult to connect with this poor, horribly mistreated little girl called Pecola Breedlove. It felt more like Morrison was trying to bludgeon every injustice suffered by Pecola and all the other characters in the book into my mind. The message was blunt and lacked the subtlety and introspection necessary to make an incisive impact on me.The overall impression is that Pecola Breedlove was just a convenient (albeit fictional) tool for the writer to expound on all the evils of mankind, without paying her character the attention and sensitivity it deserved. Morrison implies, in an admittedly powerful paragraph towards the end, that Pecola Breedlove was used and discarded by everyone in her life like so much detritus. It's ironic that in the end, I felt she did the same thing to this character too. Final rating: 3.5*, rounded up to 4.0* simply because it gave me a lucid view of another world in another time.Show more"

Just as tragic, just as depressing, and just as arresting.I have said this in my previous review but I'm gonna say it again: I still can't believe this was a debut novel.___________________________________Original review: I have no words...I can’t believe this was a debut novel. Toni Morrison just got herself a new fan.The Bluest Eye is a powerful story exploring beauty standard and its damaging effects on a black child. In the foreword, Toni Morrison wrote that when she began writing this book, she was not interested in the resistance to the contempt of others and ways to deflect it, but she was more concerned with the far more tragic and disabling consequences of humiliations: accepting them as a legitimate truth. Toni Morrison called this “the death of self-esteem.”“You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.”The Bluest Eye follows the story of Pecola Breedlove who lived in a poor, abusive and dysfunctional family. Having been told her whole life how ugly she is, Pecola literally prays every night for blue eyes because she believed her life of abuse, neglect and torment would end if she had blue eyes like the whites. An excellent work of classics and I can’t wait to read more of her works. Actual rating: 4.5 stars.Show more"

All the moments surrounding desirability and what proximity to whiteness affords people were the hardest-hitting. Toni just has a way of putting the derision and lack of care young Black girls, especially those considered less desirable/beautiful, often face from others into searing and concise language. Both from those outside of their community and those within it. It's been a while since I've wanted to highlight a book but this book made me want to treasure the quotes inside. I particularly appreciate that Toni was very real about the desire to change oneself when faced with this cruelty; self-love is hard to muster when all external messages are confirming your ugliness and neglecting your humanity. There is a specific moment towards the end of this book that made my stomach turn and made me take a break from it for a couple days. Not the book's fault, I didn't look up CW or anything, but that's what's keeping this from being a 5 star experience. I knew Toni Morrison was a powerful storyteller because I've watched videos of her speaking. But I've never read her work, so I'm glad to have started on my journey into her writing. Show more"

Aside from the fact that her books are the same garbage essentially recycled over and over again, have the same characters with the same dialect, drag out forever and ever, have messy writing that's all over the place, I realized that her books lose focus of the plot, of the right now and instead drift over to every single person's background and life story. Maybe once or twice do we see Pecola praying for blue eyes. 97% of the book was, again, the background of everyone else, with ginormous chunks of paragraphs that are anything but eye candy. I only read this trash in its entirety because I have to use it for a research paper I'm writing. I'm sick of Morrison's books being labeled as Historical fiction, when in reality it's just her anti-white people, racist, God-hating propaganda garbage. And I've had it up to here with this crap.

The documentary The Pieces I Am about the life of Toni Morrison provides an excellent background for understanding the influences on Morrison that led to this, her first book.It is a story of domestic violence, child and sexual abuse, and survival. It is the story of poor Black people in northern, industrial Ohio who are resilient. This is the territory of Morrison's childhood. While there are tragic themes in this book, that doesn't dominate the mood of the story. Of course, it is a story that could be triggering for anyone who has lived with or close to such violence.I have read some modern classics by African American writers that were disappointing. Sometimes they seemed dated, and in the case of some other books, it seemed that while this was a pioneering story when it was published, there have been better books that came afterwards. In the case of The Bluest Eye I was blown away. It was tender, and shocking. It emanated love, although there was too much violence in the lives of its young characters.Highly recommended.Show more"

Well, that was my intention but lo and behold life events waylaid, ambushed and interrupted my plans and my focus was not totally there.

Trong suy nghĩ đơn thuần của thằng nhóc mười-lăm-tuổi-rưỡi ấy, đẹp tức là có một chiếc mũi thẳng, một làn da mịn, một bờ vai rộng, một nước da sáng, một chiếc xương quai hàm vuông vức hay một chiếc bụng phẳng sắp sửa gồ lên những múi cơ. Tới tận bây giờ, khi thi thoảng nhớ về những lần trần truồng trước gương, giương cao nắm đấm, sắp sửa hủy hoại một tôi khác đang chòng chọc nhìn thẳng chính mình - cái nhìn không có chút mảy may thiện chí, tôi lại bất giác bật cười. Nhưng chính xác thì điều gì đã khiến cho đứa trẻ ngày ấy phải cảm thấy thù ghét bản thân tới độ nảy sinh khao khát tự hoại tới vậy? Thuở đó, tôi nghĩ là chỉ do mình mà thôi, nhưng càng lớn, khi cái mù mờ trong óc bớt tối tăm đi một chút, tôi lờ mờ nhận ra việc tôi căm ghét chính tôi có lẽ không phải bởi tôi, mà lại là bởi mớ hỗn tạp của những gì tôi nghe và nhìn thấy hằng ngày - những thứ định hướng đến cách tôi nghĩ, tới cách những đứa trẻ như tôi nghĩ - những đứa trẻ như Pecola Breedlove trong cuốn tiểu thuyết đầy đau đớn và day dứt này.Từ sự trắng…“Đây là ngôi nhà. Nó có màu xanh trắng. Nó có cửa đỏ. Nó rất xinh xắn. Đây là cả nhà. Mẹ, cha, Dick và Jane sống trong căn nhà xanh trắng. Họ rất hạnh phúc. Nhìn Jane xem…”Mắt nào xanh nhất không được bắt đầu bằng những lời trần thuật thông thường, nó dội vào tận đáy óc người đọc những vọng âm đầy ám ảnh của một bài vè trẻ thơ có thanh điệu trong sáng, hồn nhiên, đồng thời, nó cũng chua khé tựa hồ tiếng thét. Tiếng thét ấy dội đi dội lại, váng óc và khiếp đảm. Một tiếng thét bật ra từ thinh lặng, bấu chặt lấy từng hồi của thiên tiểu thuyết như một thứ ký sinh cứng đầu. Một tiếng thét nhớp nháp như đờm dãi và tanh tưởi hơn rác rưởi. Chỉ trong vỏn vẹn hai trang, Toni Morrison đã hoàn thiện một bản tụng ca dữ dội tôn vinh sự trắng, xây đắp nên những ảo vọng không tưởng về một gia đình da trắng trung lưu hoàn hảo - nó sinh sôi còn nhanh hơn vi rút và có sức hủy hoại kinh hoàng còn hơn cả dịch bệnh - một thứ dịch bệnh mang tính cộng đồng và khả năng lây nhiễm xuyên qua hàng thế hệ những người da đen.Nếu không đọc lời tựa của Mắt nào xanh nhất, tôi chắc chắn sẽ không bao giờ tin được đây là cuốn tiểu thuyết đầu tay của Toni Morrison, một câu chuyện đã được kể cách đây hơn năm thập kỷ và đóng vai trò như một bản tuyên ngôn cho hành trình sáng tác văn chương của bà mãi về sau này: nó trình hiện như một nỗ lực cất cao tiếng nói cho một chủng người bị “ghét bỏ, thậm chí bị hắt hủi”. Một câu chuyện với cấu trúc lẫn thông điệp đều xuất sắc tới độ không tưởng - thứ đã góp phần định hình nên tên tuổi của bà: một nhà văn, đồng thời là một nhà tư tưởng có cái nhìn đặc biệt cấp tiến. Pecola Breedlove là một đứa trẻ da đen. Ngay từ những ngày còn bé, nó đã luôn bị cả xã hội hắt hủi bởi cái vẻ ngoài mà đối với người ta, đó là sự xấu xí nguyên thủy. Sinh ra ngây thơ, nhưng lại được nuôi lớn bằng định kiến, cả đời mình, Pecola không khao khát gì hơn ngoài một đôi mắt xanh - nước màu xanh biếc mà nó từng nhiều lần trông thấy qua hình ảnh của những con búp bê tóc vàng, những hình hiệu in trên sữa hộp và trên cả, là những đứa trẻ da trắng hiện tồn xung quanh nó. Pecola tin rằng chỉ cần khoét ra và đặt lại vào hốc mắt hai nhãn cầu biêng biếc, nó sẽ trở nên xinh đẹp. Màu xanh của đôi mắt đặt trong cái đen thẳm của nước da - thoạt nhiên, chính là thứ nghịch lý điên rồ tới độ báng bổ, đã từng khiến cho Claudia - một đứa trẻ da màu đã được tôi rèn lòng kiêu hãnh chủng tộc, khiếp đảm. Tuy nhiên, khi xoáy sâu vào khao khát có vẻ phi lý đó, dường như, một thứ màu sắc khác cũng lần lồ lộ hiện ra: một màu trắng nhởn kinh dị - có thể dễ dàng bắt gặp tại bất kỳ đâu trong những gia đình kiểu mẫu, trong những ngôi trường kiểu mẫu, trong những cộng đồng kiểu mẫu - một màu trắng đi chung với những xung khắc muôn thuở về mặt chủng tộc. Dẫu vậy, dường như, những đối chọi sắc tộc này hoàn toàn không phải là sự kỳ thị ngoại biên thường thấy, mà là sự kỳ thị nội hóa ăn sâu vào trong não bộ và phì đại thành một thứ ý thức có tính thế hệ. Một màu trắng/sự trắng hủy diệt những tự thức lành mạnh về bản thể, một màu trắng xô lấn con người vào trong trạng thái luôn luôn hồ nghi, buộc họ phải luôn tự đối sánh với một chủng tộc khác, một nền văn hóa khác, một màu trắng làm cùn mòn những giá trị đạo đức căn cốt, là nguyên nhân làm băng hoại hạnh phúc, đồng thời đưa tới những chuẩn mực độc hại về cái đẹp. Tới những chuẩn mực độc hại về cái đẹpSuy cho cùng, cái đẹp dẫu sao cũng chỉ là một thứ cấu trúc được kiến tạo bởi xã hội, tuy nhiên, trong những thời điểm mà tiếng nói đa số rền vang như tiếng nổ, dập tắt một cách hoàn toàn những tiếng nói thiểu số, cái đẹp, hay rộng hơn là những thứ mà người ta tự soi chiếu lên mình, cũng dễ dàng bị bóp méo. Theo đó, khi nhìn Pecola trong quá trình vật lộn những điều nó cho là đẹp, tôi chỉ nhìn thấy sự trắng. Sự trắng lẩn khuất trong con mắt xanh mà nó luôn hằng khát khao, sự trắng chờn vờn trong những lời dỗ dành mẹ nó thủ thỉ vào tai con bé của gia đình mà bà làm giúp việc, sự trắng dập dềnh trong con nước hồi ức khi bố nó nhớ về cái ngày cuộc giao hoan của gã bị soi rọi sáng trưng dưới ánh đèn pin của hai kẻ cầm súng trong rừng. Sự trắng nhồi vào trong óc của những người da đen rằng họ là một chủng loài xấu xí, sự trắng che khuất con mắt của những người đi đường để họ mặc định người da đen ở đâu cũng là những kẻ đáng khinh thị. Ước mơ về một đôi mắt xanh là một nỗ lực đào thoát, sự nâng niu những đứa trẻ da trắng là một sự vượt bỏ, sau rốt, sự thù địch tới độ mong muốn hủy hoại chính dòng giống của mình cùng đồng thời chính là dấu chỉ rõ ràng nhất cho một sự tự diệt đã được nuôi nấng tới độ thành dáng, thành hình, hệt một chứng bệnh được di truyền trong máu và phát tán trong cái vô ảnh, vô thanh. Sẽ thật khó để có thể sắp xếp lại tất cả những gì mà Toni Morrison mong muốn đan ghép trong cuốn tiểu thuyết khiêm tốn này, điều đó không đơn thuần tới từ kết cấu phân mảnh, điểm nhìn đa tuyến, sự trình hiện không - thời gian bất nhất, mà còn tới từ những sức nặng biểu tượng được bà gài gắm từ đầu tới tận cuốn tác phẩm: thậm chí, cái họ Breedlove thoạt nghe có vẻ hết sức ngẫu nhiên, hay cái tựa đề vừa lạ kỳ, vừa có vẻ đơn độc, cũng đan cài những cách giải mã nhất định. Để hiểu được Mắt nào xanh nhất, theo tôi, không phải là cố gắng hệ thống hóa ngôn ngữ của bà thành một chỉnh thể thuần túy máy móc, thao tác căn cốt nhất, là cần đứng dưới góc độ của một kẻ bên lề và thấm thía cái thù ghét của cả xã hội đổ lên đầu gã ta, có như vậy, khi đọc cuốn tiểu thuyết này, người đọc mới có thể “động lòng”, chứ không chỉ đơn thuần “xúc động”, như đúng cái cách mà Toni Morrison mong muốn.Show more"

De blåaste ögonen är hennes debutroman. Den är inte hemlig på det sätt som nobelpristagares romaner ofta är. Det finns dessutom ett förklarande och mycket intressant efterord.De blåaste ögonen kan vara en av grymmaste böcker jag läst, (innehåller bland annat incest). När en roman är pepprad med hemskheter kan jag i vissa fall känna att det är en genväg författaren försöker ta för att skapa ”spänning”. Det är inte alls fallet med den här romanen. Morrison skriver med stor skicklighet, gestaltar som ett geni och bygger upp den här berättelsen i etapper på ett närmast perfekt sätt.”Alla människor i hela världen kunde befalla över dem. Vita kvinnor sa: ”Gör det.” Vita barn sa: ”Ge mig det.” Vita män sa: ”Kom hit.” Svarta män sa: ”Lägg dig.” De enda de inte behövt ta order av var svarta barn och varandra. Men allt detta tog de och skapade om i sin egen föreställning. De skötte vita människors hem och var medvetna om det. När vita män slog deras egna män torkade de upp blodet och gick hem för att bli utskällda av offret.”Romanen tar itu med den fördömande blick som faller på svarta, på kvinnor, på barn. Ur ett intersektionellt perspektiv är det svarta, fattiga flickor som hamnar längst ner i hierarkin och drabbas av mångdubbelt förtryck. Hon lyckas på samma gång gestalta den föraktfulla blicken och motverka den. Romanen publicerades 1970 och var tragiskt nog långt före sin tid. Inte bara vad gäller rasifiering, hennes beskrivning av kvinnlig orgasm känns modern idag. Likaså uppropet mot skönhetsideal.”Jämsides med tanken på romantisk kärlek ställdes hon inför en ny – tanken på fysisk skönhet. Den kanske mest destruktiva i det mänskliga tänkandets historia. Båda hade sitt ursprung i avund, frodades i osäkerhet och slutade i besvikelse. Genom att sätta likhetstecken mellan fysisk skönhet och dygd, kopplade hon bort sitt förstånd och drog på sig massor av självförakt.”När jag läser den här boken når jag ett epifaniskt tillstånd. Jag glömmer bort att jag läser, mitt medvetande är helt upptaget av att vara med Claudia, Frieda, Pecola och Polly. Det är oerhört plågsamt men samtidigt underbart. Jag skulle vilja att alla läste den här boken. Den innehåller allt jag kan önskar av en roman.Show more"

Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.”I listened to this book on audible (my first time listening to audio instead of reading) because I've been reading way too much (almost a book a day) and my eyes have started to hurt. But boy, was that a good decision. I listened to Toni Morrison herself read her book and that brought so much more emotions and ambience to the story than I would've ever gotten if I were to have read it myself. This book is about the despair, the hopelessness, the pain, and the anguish associated with being a black person in America in the 1940's. The way Morrison describes this despondency is so heart-wrenching and the prose so beautiful, one cannot help but really feel for her characters. Pecola, a little black girl who is considered ugly, knows she is ugly, and wants desperately to change her appearance, asks for blue eyes. The loneliness, fear, and self pity she had for herself, and the tragedy of the fulfillment of her wish, shows us the hopelessness of what it is like being someone who is shunned from society, who hates herself and her circumstances, yet has no choice but to accept it. This story is beautifully written, beautifully narrated, and beautifully delivered.Show more"

But most important is how many different styles and approaches Morrison took in telling her story. Not only did she move around in time and point of view, like so many writers do, but she also went between first person and third person omniscient in the same section, she took us into the head of a child molester, she has a character in dialogue with herself, etc. Morrison always keeps us on our toes, and yet piece by piece this is not a particularly difficult novel (the hardest part is figuring out who is each section’s narrator, if there is one). In her 1993 Afterword, Morrison expresses criticism of her own work, but the fearless young Morrison was much better than Morrison gives herself credit for.Show more"

This is one of those novels that I have a hard time rating because the content in it really hurts my heart. I recognize how significant of a narrative it is and why. It's not one of my favorite novels or one in particular that I loved by Morrison notably because of how hard it is to read for how vividly it depicts rape and incest. I was disgusted by the actions of Mr. Soaphead. The sections in which he details his exploitation of girls is just...skin crawling. (Though intentional given how his part of the story connects the events to relate back to where the story starts.) Even picking it up now, I can appreciate how well written this was and the notable themes it tackles in its unraveling story. Morrison's style of writing in ""The Bluest Eye"" is absolutely stunning for attention to detail and emotion, as well as her narration of the audiobook. I picked this up from my library on a whim - to revisit - over the past few days because it became available. I'm gutted after finishing the novel because of revisiting Pecola's journey, especially how bleak, spiraling, and depressing it is.At the heart of this story, 11-year old Pecola Breedlove is a Black girl who wants blue eyes, shunning her own looks for a beauty standard beyond what she has because of the constant encounters and reminders of how people - and the world around her - say that she's ugly. But the narrative goes beyond just that distinction. The setting is in Ohio during 1941, told from a multitude of perspectives at different times. It can be confusing for a reader who may not realize how the stories intersect, but the primary first person perspective is through 9-year old Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of the foster parents who take in Pecola. Claudia is one of a few friends Pecola has, alongside Claudia's sister Frieda. You gradually learn about what factors into Pecola's experiences and reasoning, including learning about Pecola's parents (Cholly and Pauline - aka Polly) as they were young, family members, and several other supporting characters that are highlighted in the flashbacks throughout the novel. There's so much trauma that gets unpacked in the experiences by these characters. It's so well-layered throughout the novel, particularly where the characters are either faced with familial rejection, internalized and externalized racism, domestic abuses among other showcases of trauma. I'll note that aside from the rape/incest, which I felt was a bit too much for me to really connect. I'll be transparent and say the latter threw me out of the story several times having to take breathers between. I followed everything else well even with the shifting perspectives. Eventually, the narrative works up to the moment where Pecola ""gets her blue eyes."" And believe me when I say, her achieving that measure - especially with respect to everything happening before that and what Claudia observes in Pecola at that part of the novel considering particular revelations - is nothing to celebrate. My heart hurt seeing where the story goes from where it started. I understood the intention, but also noted that this is the kind of novel where the reception of it is polarizing because of the specific portrayal of the difficult subjects in this.So with that in mind, it made sense to me to give ""The Bluest Eye"" 3-stars, right on the fence of my perception of it. I loved the writing style, I loved the attention to the characterization and the unpacking of many themes I could relate to that are pertinent to the experience of racism and unrealistic perceptions of beauty alongside other unpacked experiences of trauma in the experiences of the Black cast of characters here. But I would say the way some of those traumas were unpacked were too much for me - personally - to consider it a favorite.Overall score: 3/5 stars.Show more"

I loved it.The novel's form jumped out at me as perhaps indicative of a young writer or first-time novelist's method (although Morrison was 39 when she published this, her first novel). I used it myself in my own first novel, Inbetween; that is, having worked on longer and longer short stories, I took a sort of fragmentary approach to constructing a novel, giving myself an over-arching thematic idea as a kind of scaffolding, and then writing shorter scenes that come together through theme more than event. I would argue that this form is still narrative, still a story, just a non-linear and non-event-based story. Such works always get ""groundbreaking"" in their blurbs for no two of them are ever quite alike. I find such works refreshing and always interesting.In The Bluest Eye Morrison achieves depth in the narrative, creates a novel-length story, by shifting voices and digressing, really, into the backstories of the various characters involved--even, toward the end, really a very minor player in the overall drama, but whose story is one of the most compelling of all. The stories, often informing us of the histories of characters we've already seen in action and upon whom we've made judgments, thus shifts often as we become familiar with the events that made them into the people we've already seen--which is also a great life-lesson regarding judgment. Consequently, however, I can understand purists who value the hackneyed (to me) linear and episodic story of the romance as cultivated by the so-called great novel tradition feeling a little uncomfortable or even somewhat cheated by this novel. I, on the other hand, just loved the voices, the stories, the way it all came together to, as Morrison says in the added Afterward, ""peck away at the gaze that condemns..."" her protagonist, Pecola. The gaze and its judgemental nature is a fabulous theme, so important, and, it seems to me, seldom explored by writers.Overall, however, theme, as in all of the best U.S. fiction really is the anguish of our American culture. Morrison thus takes her place beside Selby Jr., McCullers, Gaddis, etc. etc. as another eloquent spokesperson for the anguish generated by the U.S.A.'s utopian foundation and how little of it we've been able to realize in two and a half centuries of what amounts mostly to hypocrisy. We work for others in the name of freedom, we bully and dominate the world with our military in the name of freedom, and we endlessly crush women, the poor, immigrants, and ethnic minorities in the name of freedom, all the while proclaiming equality for all. Even Ahab's whale comes to mind. America is anguish and the best American novels all seem to confront it head on, the enormous gap between what we think we are and what we really are, how we internalize that and basically either learn to numb ourselves to it or go mad.Show more"

Es monstruosa de pies a cabeza; cuestionable, cruda, honesta, tierna, violenta, dulce, apasionante, dolorosa y muy, muy humana.La historia central se trata de Pecola, una pequeña niña negra que se considera fea y cuyo mayor anhelo es tener ojos azules para sentirse amada. Pero la desgarradora historia de esta niña es solo el centro de un molino donde se mueven otras monstruosas vidas humanas, tan reales y tibias que hasta el personaje más despiadado, sucio y despreciable muestra un lado tan sensible e inocente que te hace pensar que tal vez, la violenta naturaleza humana es solo el resultado de una terrible y estruendosa necesidad de afecto.

Y esto sucedió, no porque el texto sea complejo ni mucho menos aburrido, sino porque necesitada regresar, una y otra vez, a distintos pasajes.La pequeña Pecola Bredlove sólo tiene un deseo: tener los ojos azules, porque confía que será la solución a todos sus problemas; a ser una niña afroamericana de baja condición social y poca educación, a quien todos se refieren como ""fea"".No puedo siquiera empezar a describir todos los sentimientos y pensamientos que desató esta lectura. Es una profunda crítica a nuestro sentido de lo ""bello""y la importancia que le damos, así como de las consecuencias que no dimensionamos que puede tener sobre los miembros más vulnerables de nuestra sociedad: las niñas y niños. En esta novela, Toni Morrison narra la historia de Pecola a través de los ojos que la rodean. No hace esto para justificar cómo actúan quienes hacen daño o no hacen nada para proteger a Pecola, sino para presentar una radiografía de la naturaleza humana, al racismo, odio propio, a la pobreza y sexualidad desde una perspectiva realista, cruda, pero hermosamente escrita. Por muy oscura y trágica que resulta esta historia no deja de poseer belleza, como las flores azules que crecen como maleza.

Olin yllättynyt siitä, miten järkyttäviä tapahtumia romaani kuvaa; keskiverto nykydekkari sisältää vähemmän raakuuksia kuin tämä teos. Tiesin etukäteen kirjan ytimen, sen että musta tyttö toivoo itselleen sinisiä silmiä, mutta minut yllättivät myös kerronnan ja näkökulmien tiheä vaihtelu sekä kertomuksen sirpaleisuus. Itsensä rumaksi kokevan Pecolan vaiheita katsotaan monesta suunnasta, hänen vanhempiensa menneisyys käydään läpi molempien osalta; taakkoja siirtyy sukupolvien takaa. Pysäyttävää on myös, miten muut rodullistetut suhtautuvat muualta muuttaneeseen perheeseen – oli voimassa jako ”värillisiin” ja niihin, joita kutsuttiin n-sanalla. Erityisesti romaanissa on kyse rodullisen itseinhon purkamisesta, ja teosta valottaa kiinnostavasti Morrisonin vuoden 1993 jälkipuhe, jossa hän kertoo mihin seikkoihin kirjassa ei enää tuolloin ollut tyytyväinen – kertomuksen hajottaminen osiin oli yksi näistä, ja minäkin mietin, että teoksen rakentumisen dynamiikkaa ja dramaturgiaa olisi vielä voinut kehittää. Sinisimmät silmät on tapahtumiensa kauheudessakin hienosti kirjoitettu romaani, joka antoi Morrisonin uralle aikanaan komean lähdön (ymmärtämättömästä aikalaiskritiikistä huolimatta) kohti myöhempiä suuria tunnustuksia. ”Koska tiesimme, että oli sellainen seikka kuin taivasalle joutuminen, meille kehittyi omaisuuden, omistamisen nälkä. Pihan, kuistin, viinitarhan vankan omistuksen. Omistavat mustat kohdistivat kaiken tarmonsa, kaiken rakkautensa pesiinsä.” (s. 21)”Päädyttyään tähän velvoittavaan vakaumukseen, että vain ihme voisi päästää hänet pälkähästä, hän ei ollut koskaan tietävä kauneuttaan. Hän näkisi vain sen mikä nähtävissä oli: toisten ihmisten silmät.” (s. 47)”Rakkaus ei ole koskaan rakastajaa parempi.” (s. 197)Show more"

I own several paper copies, the oldest from when I first read it and the newest a reissue in hardcover. I have taught this novel, and because I would excerpt the pages near the beginning when Claudia describes being sick and her mother's anger, how she did not understand that her mother was angry at the sickness and not her, and how her mother walks barefoot through a dark house to check on her in the night. ""when I think of autumn, I think of somebody with hands who does not want me to die."" There are many passages I count among my favorites in all of literature. The last three pages are among the wisest I have ever read. I like that Morrison wrote the novel because she belonged to a writing group and was not writing. When the other members told her she had to bring something if she was going to keep attending, this single mother went home each night after working full time as an editor, put her boys to bed, and wrote the first of a line of brilliant novels that explain how terrible things are done and observed, and sometimes are survived. Pecola Breedlove does not survive, of course. She is destroyed. We know this immediately. The book is painful and sad, but I still insist that Morrison offers redemption in the narration of Claudia MacTeer, the grown woman who wants to understand and who accepts her part in Pecola's fall. Each of the characters in the novel exist on the page for the sake of the damage, mostly damage, they do to a little girl who accepted the ""cloak of ugliness"" in her hands and wore it without question, without understanding that it did not belong to her. She was not ugly; she believed in her ugliness and that conviction made it true.Show more"

Although I have given this book five stars, I don't know that I enjoyed it. I don't know that one CAN enjoy this. But it was engaging and devastating in all the right ways.The language this book uses really works for it. It's poetic, it's gritty, it grabs right onto you. No matter what atrocities were being depicted, I couldn't help but find the language beautiful. The overall style just worked perfectly with what was happening, and the transitions between stories of different characters was artful.The characters and the story were painfully real to me. This story felt like the dreadful things happening in your hometown that you had no idea were happening. I especially appreciated that even the characters who would only have been depicted as evil otherwise were given their own stories, making their evilness feel more human and frightening. Every step of this book is heartbreaking and every step of this book makes you wish the world was a better place. As a whole, The Bluest Eye is a book well worth reading, one with excellent writing and a painful story. Reading this made me want to read more of Morrison's works and I can't recommend this particular one enough. It isn't a book for everyone however.

It is a heavy read but so relevant. I think that the back story on all the characters was necessary so the readers know what molded them. I think the major point of the book is to show that the notion that white equates to beauty is distorted—and that it can affect the esteem of black women. We, as readers, know that this book deals with racism—but there are no overtly, extravagant examples. When I read and discussed it the first time, a lot of people in my group missed what actually happened to Pecola. I think the conversation that she has at the end tells us that her baby died and she has lost her mind. Two strong symbols in this book are light colored eyes and flowers. Pecola believes if her eyes were light in color, preferably blue, it would solve all her problems—-because afterall, all the people that she knows with light colored eyes have easy lives and are loved. Frieda and Claudia planted seeds for Pecola’s baby—but the seeds didn’t sprout and the baby died.In my opinion, this is a great book club pick . There is so much to discuss—Mrs. Breedlove’s tenderness with a disrespectful white child and the harshness she harbors for Pecola, Cholly’s first sexual experience, and Geraldine and her cat are all great topics .The only fault that I find is that it seems like Morrison lends too much grace to Cholly.No he didn’t have parents, no he didn’t know how to be a parent, and he had experiences in his life that dehumanized and emasculated him but I just personally find it hard to feel sorry for a drunken wife beater who rapes his own daughter.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

The Bluest Eye was originally published in 1970 and was Morrison's debut novel. This book must have been caused shockwaves back then but now 45 years later the subject matter is not too original or ground breaking to me. I felt the writing was uneven and disjointed.

La protagonista è Pecola Breedlove, una ragazzina di undici anni, di colore, ossessionata dagli occhi azzurri.La sua famiglia è povera e altamente disfunzionale, e Pecola si convince che se fosse bella e avesse gli occhi azzurri, non le toccherebbe vedere e subire tutte le cose brutte che le capitano.⠀Il tema principale di questo libro è il razzismo interiorizzato. La famiglia Breedlove, pensa di valere e meritare meno di una famiglia bianca, e Pecola inevitabilmente assimila questo pensiero nocivo, e non ha gli strumenti necessari per assumere consapevolezza di sé. Infatti la storia non è raccontata da Pecola, ma da alcune sue amiche, e Pecola si lascia solamente raccontare.⠀Un libro che parla di odio razziale, di standard di bellezza malsani, abusi, traumi. Non è un libro facile e mi ha fatto versare parecchie lacrime.Show more"

Pecola is an incest victim, pregnant with her father's child, and sees herself as ugly. Morrison is capable of making the reader empathize with characters that are just so far away from our own experience, and even relate, on some level, to characters who are committing terrible acts. The writing talent is hard to overstate. I would have given it five stars except there is a certain disjointedness to the storytelling that detracts ever so slightly from the book as a whole. I'm so glad I finally read a book by Morrison, and I look forward to reading more.Show more"

I can't do this anymore, I need to take a break from tragedy, from evilness, from soul crushing sadness. I can find all those things every time I log onto the internet and read the news and the comments of hideous strangers arguing. I don't need it in the books I read as well.

I cannot describe it. I was just gaping and gasping. This feels like poetry and definitely doesn't roll off the tongue like it. The narrative is all over the place and its genius. The characters are all awful people but my heart is still so broken for each and every one of them. The subject matter of this book is so depressing and Pecola is little more than a human punching bag tearing at the seams, but it serves purpose. A horrible, truthful purpose that holds none of its punches. I feel that it might be so sick and twisted of me to say how I couldn't put this down and how I couldn't stop thinking about it after finishing this morning at 3AM. Completely devastated. I could not get enough of Morrison's style in this. Her imagery is always so sharp, so dynamic, and there's an honesty and brutality so stark that it in turn, much like Claudia's ideal Christmas experience, engages all of one's senses to the nth degree. I took so many pictures of the paragraphs that punched me senseless and I would quote them all night long—but I think that this is the one that aptly captures the spirit of this story, as viewed by Pecola's mother Pauline:Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another — physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap.The ever-eloquent @mynameismarines states that ""the story of beauty was at the surface, but soon Morrison was discussing issues of racism, class, the cycle of poverty and abuse and disappointed hopes and lack of privilege. It spiraled from this one wish, for blue eyes, and soon encapsulated so many other struggles."" And God yes, what a richly layered book. There's colourism. Racism. Sexism. Sexual violence. Beauty standards. Feeling lesser and lashing out because of said beauty standards. Schadenfreude. The fallout of realising that you have taken part in schadenfreude, then trying but ultimately failing to atone for it, through spiritual gestures or otherwise. Claudia and Freida feel for Pecola but ultimately could have done nothing, and their sacrificed seeds never grow. No one wins. The denouement of this with Soaphead Church and Pecola's conversation with herself is just gonna fucking haunt me for life, and I tell you in all seriousness that I welcome it. I know it would be utterly reductive to try and simmer down this review, but I think at the very heart of this is something so inscrutable because racism itself is so inscrutable. I, too, saw a bit of myself in Pecola, or at least a younger, more impressionable version of myself who saw big blue eyes as the epitome of all beauty. And now that I have read this with my not-as-big but very proud, dark Asian eyes, I must tell you what a relief it is to not hold that belief anymore, and what relish it is to experience such vivid feelings reading this. I can't stress how important this book is. And now, if I should be allowed a moment of absolute awe and gracelessness: you're telling me this was Toni Morrison's debut??? My God. Wow. Okay. No pressure. I was expecting that but GOOD LORD, I'm still reeling. Show more"

Thank god for 200pg books am I right (write lol) anyways I am reading TM books in order. I read this book in high school and it really hit different this go around. Im noticing way more themes than I did then. Also I think bc we were in school and my teacher was white, she didnt touch upon alot of things. This book main themes are power systems, self hatred and the construction of identity. Though I didnt grow up in the 1940s like the main characters I have been affected by how the world treats (darker) black people especially black women. Pecola struggling with her identity and not seeing any value in herself because it was never mirrored to her. People think “self esteem” comes from self when in actuality alot of it comes from the validation you get from the world and your love ones. It seems that everywhere Pecola turned it was confirming to herself that she had no value. We are all products of our environments and when the world is telling you and also showing you that you are ugly, you have no choice but to believe it. In her case she also was showed she wasnt deserving of love or kindness. I also really liked the juxtaposition of the girls realizing Maureen was pretty and something to be admired which by default meant that they were ugly/not worthy in comparison. I also like how in the ending Pecola was essentially “free”. I dont want to give spoilers because I encourage others to read as well but it is crazy that the themes spoken about in this book is still alive and very much well. Show more"

This isn't an easy read. It's not because the prose is particularly difficult. However the substance of this book is incredibly hard to wrestle with. One should not read this book quickly.

While there are, as some say ""problems with the writing"", such as different voices telling the story sometimes to confusing effect, the level of sophistication of the novel itself, of the ideas it presents, of the way in which the characters are drawn and interact, of the overall construction, of the language and beauty of the writing made me appreciate this novel best out of the three by Morrison I've read so far (the other two being Beloved and A Mercy). The introduction begins with a 'Dick and Jane' story: ""Here is the house. It is green and white. It has a red door. It is very pretty . . . Here comes a friend. The friend will play with Jane. They will play a good game. Play, Jane, play."" This quaint little bit of school primer, with its image of perfect simplicity and happiness, and not least of which, white children Dick and Jane who 'play and play', and which forms a motif throughout the novel, comes as an ominous sign that things will be far from simple fun and games for Pecola, the novel's 11-year-old black heroine, who is described as an ugly girl and whose greatest wish in life—in spite of the abject poverty she lives in, the miserable family life, the poor treatment she receives from nearly everybody she comes in contact with—is to have the 'bluest eyes'.The first words of the novel may give us the whole story; it starts with the conclusion as it were, but as one coming freshly to this novel, not having read anything else beyond a short descriptive blurb, their meaning, was lost on me, though their poetry was not:""There were no marigolds in the fall of 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father's baby that the marigolds did not grow. A little examination and much less melancholy would have proved to us that our seeds were not the only ones that did not sprout; nobody's did. Not even the gardens fronting the lake showed marigolds that year. But so deeply concerned were we with the health and safe delivery of Pecola's baby we could think of nothing but our own magic: if we planted the seeds, and said the right words over them, they would blossom, and everything would be alright. It was a long time before my sister and I admitted to ourselves that no green was going to spring from our seeds. Once we knew, our guilt was relieved only by fights and mutual accusations about who was to blame. For years I thought my sister was right: it was my fault. I had planted them too far down in the earth. It never occured to either one of us that the earth itself might have been unyielding. We had dropped our seeds in our own little plot of black dirt just as Pecola's father had dropped his seeds in his own plot of black dirt. Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. What is clear now is that of all of that hope, fear, lust, love, and grief, nothing remains but Pecola and the unyielding earth. Cholly Breedlove is dead; our innocence too. The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too. There is really nothing more to say--except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.""The voices of various characters involved in Pecola's life from the little girls whose home Pecola is taken into, to her own mother and father, take over the narrative and give their points of view; describing their histories, they give us a better understanding of the how things came to be the way they end up for poor Pecola. One of the strengths of the novel is that though we know from the beginning it is a story which will end badly and the protagonists will have harsh realities to contend with, it never drags us down into bleakness and despair. Perhaps this is because Morrison's writing is never sentimental, but rather observant of the small details of life, so that even when things are at their worst, there is always something interesting going on. 
The Bluest Eye
 is of course a powerful commentary on racial hatred, but it also carries another powerful message. In describing how the beauty myth operates, Morrison describes how humanity as a whole has sought to escape from the harshness and vastly unfair playground that is life into this impossible ideal, which is bound to disappoint: ""Along with the idea of romantic love, [Pecola] was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion."" ★★★★½ — Edited from October 2011Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6903121-jenn-ravey,The Bluest Eye,Rating 3 out of 5,"January 27, 2012",6 likes,0,"Only Toni Morrison can so beautifully weave her words together in such a way as to make the reader appreciate the loveliness but still comprehend the stark meaning of all those linked words. In her first novel, The Bluest Eye, Morrison writes of Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl who knows the power of beauty and who prays every day for blue eyes, for the chance to be seen as pretty. Her story is told mainly through the eyes of Claudia MacTeer, whose family takes Pecola in after Pecola’s father tries to burn down her house. The girls drink milk from a Shirley Temple glass, and Pecola sneaks extra milk simply to have the privilege to see Shirley’s sweet white face and dainty curls. This is a community that, although filled with blacks, sees no value in the skin of their own and willingly betrays that flesh time and again.Claudia’s voice alternates with an omniscient narrator, and the narrative voice is fragmented, a ploy which Morrison will use later in several of her works. Particularly for a first novel, The Bluest Eye is a wonderful study in literary portraiture, as throughout, each character is dissected and explained in vivid detail, making the reader’s judgment of the character’s actions more difficult. This is what the story hinges on as it is full of rape, incest, demoralization, shame, arousal, joy, superstition, and pain.Within this framework, we watch the characters in a sort of vacuum. There is no outward show of racism, i.e. white community v. black community; however, the seemingly innocuous presence of the Shirley Temple glass is enough to get the point across: black isn’t beautiful in small-town Ohio. Shirley Temple is the impossible goal, and the inner shame and defeat felt by the young girls in the book is evident through the schoolhouse taunting by white girls, white boys, black boys, and lighter-skinned black girls. Maureen Peel, light-skinned and immune to teasing, briefly befriends Claudia, her sister Frieda, and Pecola Breedlove, only to shun them and scream that they are ugly when Claudia stands up to Maureen for teasing Pecola. Maureen teases Pecola about seeing her father naked, knowing that Pecola has been raped by her father.There is good and there is bad, right and wrong, yet the girls don’t always know what falls into which category. When Pecola first menstruates, Claudia and Frieda help her, hiding the shame of her womanhood from their mother. However, a young girl hiding in the bushes yells for Ms. MacTeer that the girls are being “nasty,” and Frieda gets a beating for being such. Once Ms. MacTeer recognizes the truth, she is implicit in the shame and brings the girls into the fold.However, it is not only women and young girls who are shamed in the book. Cholly Breedlove, Pecola’s father, is raised by Aunt Jimmy after his father abandons his mother and his mother runs away. At Aunt Jimmy’s funeral, Cholly sneaks off into the woods with a girl. The two begin kissing and touching one another when two white hunters come upon them. Cholly and the girl are frightened and readjust their clothing, but the two men hold the gun to them and force them to touch one another while yelling and egging them on, treating them as animals. Cholly carries that shame with him throughout his life and only relieves it when he meets his sweet wife, Pecola’s mother, Pauline. However, his shame returns, and his innocent daughter becomes his redemption and curse.Thanks to Devourer of Books and her Audiobook Week (in June) celebrating audiobooks, I picked up The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. It was narrated by Ruby Dee and Toni Morrison herself. I used to listen to audiobooks fairly regularly, but it has been awhile. However, I recently started teaching at a college that requires a bit of a commute. I picked up The Bluest Eye after looking through the shelves and seeing audiobooks that ran 15-30 hours. This particular one ran three hours, which I guessed would take about a week to get through. Well, I guess I’m in the car more than I thought because it only took two days to get through. Two days, a couple of missed exits, and some detours to listen a bit longer, I finished the book.Some readers are reluctant to pick up Toni Morrison after having read or watched Beloved. If so, I believe you are missing so much. Toni Morrison is a rich, complex, layered writer, and her stories have always resonated with me. My particular favorites are Sula and Song of Solomon.Show more"

Gdy zapytano ją o jej debiutancką książkę, odpowiedziała, że podeszła do pisania nie jako pisarka właśnie, ale jako czytelniczka. Do tamtej pory, w literaturze amerykańskiej nie było tak prawdziwego, tak szczerego głosu ukazującego społeczność afroamerykańską z dziewczyńskiej perspektywy, nie było historii o małych czarnoskórych dziewczynkach, ba, nie było podobnych historii o dorastaniu, z którymi ta społeczność mogła się utożsamiać. Toni Morrison stała się właśnie takim głosem. „Najbardziej niebieskie oko” to zresztą bardzo osobista książka – rozgrywa się w rodzinnym mieście autorki, w znajomym otoczeniu, na znajomych ulicach…Kontynuując myśl samej Toni Morrison, „Najbardziej niebieskie oko” to opowieść o rasizmie, o bólu, jaki wywołuje, o tym, że może człowieka zniszczyć, zmiażdżyć od środka. Przez opowieść przewija się motyw brzydoty – brzydoty, która zdaje się być odbiciem tego, w jaki sposób piękno ukazywane jest w kulturze, ze skojarzeniami, jakie wzbudza. Kanony piękna nie uwzględniały innych ras poza białą, wzorce piękny przez dziesięciolecia były jednoznaczne. W „Najbardziej niebieskim oku” symbolem tego wzorca jest kubeczek z podobizną słodziuchnej, niebieskookiej Shirley Temple. I ten kubek – obsesja na jego punkcie – staje się podstawą pod niepewność dorastającej dziewczynki. Ta niepewność obudzi z czasem nienawiść do samej siebie, to poczucie, że nie zasługuje na miłość, na dobro, bo jej uroda nie jest spójna, nie jest taka, jak „powinna być”. To przerażający obraz, tragiczna wizja dorastania z poczuciem, że nigdy nie dogoni się nieuchwytnego obrazu samej siebie. Nieprawdziwego, odrealnionego obrazu. Obrazu, który niejako utwierdza w niej przemocowa rodzina, rodzina, w której nie może odnaleźć oparcia. W zamian otrzymuje jeszcze większe okrucieństwo, pada ofiarą niewytłumaczalnego bestialstwa, które naznacza ją i jej ciało już na zawsze.„Najbardziej niebieskie oko” to jedna z tych ważnych, tych pięknych i przerażających książek, książek również kontrowersyjnych, które z jednej strony weszły do kanonu lektur na uniwersytetach, a z drugiej, zostały zakazane w wielu amerykańskich szkołach. Przyczyną jest tutaj język, tematyka, przemoc i okrucieństwo w niej pokazane. To historia o trudach dorastania, o zmaganiu się z dyskryminacją, z konsekwencjami owej dyskryminacji. O rodzinach, które mogą być wsparciem, ale mogą być też największą przeszkodą, pułapką, która niszczy ludzką istotę. Pisana bez owijania w bawełnę, językiem barwnym, ale bardzo doprecyzowanym, bo o doprecyzowanie pewnych aktów, pewnych czynów tutaj właśnie chodzi. Rasizm jest rasizmem. Dyskryminacja jest dyskryminacją. Molestowanie jest molestowaniem.Komisja noblowska przyznała Toni Morrison nagrodę za całokształt twórczości, zaznaczając, że jest to nagroda za „wizjonerką siłę, za poetycki wkład, który pozwolił ożywić tak istotny aspekt amerykańskiej rzeczywistości”. „Najbardziej niebieskie oko” jest pysznym tego werdyktu przykładem. To powieść odważna. Miejscami miażdżąca. Nieśmiertelna mimo kolejnych upływających lat. A w przekładzie Kai Gucio przemawiająca językiem właśnie. A o to przecież Toni Morrison naprawdę chodziło.Show more"

I finished reading this only weeks before Ms. Morrison's passing which makes it the last Morrison book I was able to finish while she was alive. This seems fitting considering that many would call this Ms. Morrison's best novel.I will likely re-read this book as part of me was ghost reading it if that makes sense. I mean, I was so awe-struck by it that it's hard to remember what I loved about it. I will say that one of the first things that had an impact on me was the forward where Ms. Morrison talks about how certain readers perceived the character of Pecola with pity rather than resolve against misogynoir (21st century word). I liked that she mentioned that because not only did it prime me against pitying Pecola and her family et al. but also reminded me that many readers may have had that take. What I love about Ms. Morrison is that there were so many instances in this book alone where I knew she was writing for Black people. There were many cultural elements, a few of which even I did not quite immediately grasp, that rather than explained were normalized. I appreciate that. It was only when I saw the interview she had with Charlie Rose that this was contextualized for me that this was an intentional approach: writing for Black people. I also loved that while the book is told partly in third person, the only part of the story is told from the POV of Claudia who is a fellow Black girl. Why does this matter? Because sometimes people can mistake the third person for someone distant from the story, someone not only non-Black but someone unsympathetic for the protagonist. While the third person voice does not relay this, I think that the inclusion of Claudia and her sister re-affirmed that the story was sympathetic of Pecola and was being told from a Black lens. The Bluest Eye is heartbreaking. Perhaps almost as heartbreaking as Sula. But what I admire about this is that Morrison provides pretty concrete ways of HOW the life of Pecola may have prevented. They may not appear to be concrete but all of the things leading up to Pecola's life outcome are made pretty clear in the novel. But what is also clear is that Pecola's problems are not simply familial, which if this were the case would serve only to pathologize her Black family. No, these are also the problems of the nation and the world. The way Pecola sees herself isn't merely an illness of the mind (which would be ableist, anyway); there is in fact a very ubiquitous propaganda campaign that makes Black girls and Black women hate themselves in mass media. While Pecola's view of herself is tragic, it is actually a rational viewpoint to have, given all that not only the media tells her but how internalized anti-Blackness is expressed by her peers and family members. Her only relief is the occasional helping hands of Claudia and her sister -- but individuals alone cannot completely resolve this kind of conflict.As has become evident to me, Ms. Morrison handles these topics with both a steadfast and delicate hand. Her stories are sticking with me, in ways that most stories rarely do. She will be missed, and I believe she will rest in power. Show more"

It has been nineteen years, and my love for this book only grows with passing time. The Bluest Eye is a book that needs to be read by everyone. It is a book that is most contested, and also banned in schools and colleges in the US of A. It is a book that didn’t shy away from saying what it had to, when it was first published in 1970, and even after 50 years, it says all that it has to and reaches more readers every single day.The novel takes place in Lorain, Ohio and tells the story of a young African American girl Pecola, who grows up in the years following The Great Depression. She is deemed to be ugly by people around her. She believes it as well. All she wants the bluest of eyes (like the Shirley Temple Doll), which to her is the quality of a “white girl” – the kind of girl everyone loves and adores. And even then, though Pecola is at the heart of this novel, she is the soul of the novel so to say, we as readers will never hear her side of the story. Morrison doesn’t grant us that.I cannot say anything new about this classic that hasn’t already been said before. It has all been said in 50 years, and more. All narratives have been explored. All angles have been analysed. What remains at the heart of it is a story told that is traumatic, holding a mirror to our society, and showing the dark recesses of human nature.Toni Morrison never did flinch from telling things the way they were. Yes, The Bluest Eye might make some readers most uncomfortable. But that’s the intent. To feel that discomfort and understand and empathise and see the world differently. Yes, it is about Pecola and her abusive father and her mother who cannot do anything. But that’s the truth Ms. Morrison wanted to bring to fore which she did most candidly – making readers question about beauty, about fitting in, and all of this through an impoverished black girl who just wants to be accepted, and the only way she knows it can happen is by wishing for pretty blue eyes.The Bluest Eye even when I reread it this month made me look and see at every step of the way – in and out of this book as well. Morrison had said that she wrote The Bluest Eye because she wanted to read it. She makes us aware of children and their lives, their truths and their questions through Pecola and the children who are narrating this story (or have they become adults?). Pecola cannot be shaken, cannot be broken, and as heartbreaking and horrible it is, the only love Pecola seems to have known has come from her abusive father Cholly.The Bluest Eye makes us see truths that we shy away from. Of how it feels not to be a whole person. Of how it is to know that our cracked selves are just a manifestation of the society we live in. Of how desperately we want the world to look at us differently.The Bluest Eye to me is about where you come from and where you hope to go. It is all about what you dream about, despite the circumstances, despite what surrounds you, and despite what you look like to the rest of the world (in this case Pecola to the rest of the town and neighbourhood). The Bluest Eye is and will always be a landmark read for me. I will visit it more often than not. Morrison’s debut should be read, and reread, and read some more.Show more"

But mainly because I felt these were the words this book kept whispering to me as I went further and further along: I may destroy you. And it did.I finished it last night right before going to bed and the story snuck into my dreams, as stories that make a mark often do. Now that I'm awake again, I can't stop thinking about it. I want to read it again already, fully knowing what a brutal blow it was to experience it the first time, and not at all anticipating that the impact will be any smaller the next time. Just thinking back on some of the things described there make my eyes feel watery and my throat small. I think you, whoever you are, should read it too. Not just because of the genius writing, although you can witness it in every page. This is not just someone who won a Nobel prize, it's someone who deserved to win it. She stands among the greats and it's easy to understand why. But I think you should read it because I take it you're an adult, like me. And as I read this heart wrenching tale of a young black girl as the world devours her soul and her body, I couldn't help but noticing how we, adults that make up the societies we live in, fail our children. We fail them so very deeply. Especially if they're black girls and especially if we're white adults. This world is not a safe place for them to exist in. In fact, it can't wait to sink its teeth and feast on everything they're made of, and we don't stop this from happening. Hell, most of the times we, even in the tiniest of ways, ensure that things remain the same. We don't do enough to protect them, to shield them and ensure they can grow and expand themselves at will, which should be the birthright of every child. It kills me to know this book takes place in 1941 and in many ways nothing has changed 80 years later. We still have the same ideals of beauty: white, blue-eyed, European. We still collectively turn a blind eye on the horrors that are happening under our nose. It's just so devastatingly sad and absurd. So yes, I think you should read this book and allow these difficult thoughts and questions to enter your mind. And maybe then we can start to figure out how we can do better. Show more"

I couldn't have been more wrong. I am aware that my opinion is very unpopular, however, I think that I should be very honest in my reviews. First off, this novel is written in a very boring way. Not only is it boring, it's confusing and doesn't have an ordered storyline. It's just all over the place. The blurb is also very misleading because that's just a small part of the novel.Nonetheless the biggest issues of this book were the following. This book is not going to eliminate the feelings of inferiority of those who experience racial hate, in my opinion, it will only worsen them. It will also in no way stop racism, I can imagine it doing the exact opposite. And that's not okay. Racist comments were not corrected. On the contrary, even the black people seemed to have racist thoughts towards their own race. And this point of view was never confronted with the truth. I felt that racism was excused.Also, the characters response to hate was not the right one. They only reacted aggressively in their actions or thoughts. Is that the solution? Trying to stop hate with hate? Why make characters act that way, when they're obviously not the bad guys in the story?Lastly, this book also disgusted me in its very explicit and unnecessary descriptions of immoral sexual acts. There is a pedophile and also a father who rapes his own daughter. I understand that sometimes these horrendous things need to be part of a story. However, I don't want to read it from the view of the sexual offender with all his wicked thoughts, as if his reasons are normal and human. It can't be rationalized. The main point wasn't the victim's suffering, it was the offender's reasons as to why this should be excused and accepted.To say that I didn't enjoy this would be an understatement. I hated it.

That is why she’s one of my favorite authors.  This book reminds me of an Oscar winning movie called Precious. Just like the movie, the Bluest Eye deals with racism, incest, child molestation and beauty myths. Although this book was published in 1970 and the events occur in 1941, it’s still shockingly relevant and probably will stay relevant for a long time. Due to the controversial and sensitive nature of the topics tackled in this book, there have been numerous attempts to ban it from schools and libraries. Story Line:The Bluest Eye is Toni Morrison's first novel. The novel narrates a tragic story of a young black girl growing up in Morrison's hometown in Ohio after the Great Depression.The story follows the tragic evolution of Pocola who thinks being born with curly hair, brown eyes and black skin is a curse; therefore, she prays every day for beauty. In her mind being beautiful means being ‘white-skinned’ and ‘blue-eyed’ [just like her idol Shirley Temple] Things take a dark turn leading to Pocola’s rape and miscarriage. Writing Style: I probably highlighted 40% of the book because of its beautiful lyrical style. Morrison creates a fusion between gospel and jazz and mixes them with black vernacular, so you’ll feel like you’re reading poetry not prose. Moral of the story:The book is an examination of our overwhelming obsession with beauty and conformity to the culture that promotes standards for beauty.I recommend it to mature readers and those who like to read African American Literature.Show more"

Jak ja bym chciał więcej czytać takich debiutów! W mojej karierze czytelniczej, która w zakresie świadomym trwa już jakieś 25 lat (od czasu lektury ""Puc, Bursztyn i goście"") Toni Morrison pojawiała się i znikała, nigdy nie zagościła w moim serduszku na dłużej. Obiecuję to zmienić, gdyż prezentowana tu książka to dzieło doskonałe, nie dość że opowiada o czymś, co jest dla mnie ciekawe (i ideologicznie dobre), robi to w sposób, który sprawia, że się budzę i chcę więcej. To się po prostu świetnie czyta!To co się udało w ""Najbardziej..."", to zmuszenie mnie do empatii z czarną dziewczynką, która jest wściekła na świat, w którym cały czas czuje się wykluczana i to głównie za sprawą ""swoich"" - czarnych, którzy z pokorą znoszą upokorzenia i dla których podporządkowanie jest stanem naturalnym. Morrison tworzy opowieść, która nie tylko boli i ma nas wyrwać z uśpienia, ale która ma nas nauczyć, że na świat trzeba patrzyć krytycznie i kwestionować istniejące reguły.Dzisiaj jestem nastawiony na ładne acz wściekłe zdania, bo dziesięć lat temu wierzyłem w postęp - człowiek działał w organizacjach pro-LGBT, oglądał słupki rosnącej tolerancji i planował strategię drobnych kroków w drodze do zwiększania stopnia równości.

Right from the beginning, she tells of the tragedy that will take place and doing so certainly helps the pieces come together throughout the novel.The story is told through various viewpoints which adds significant credibility. Had Morrison stuck with the viewpoint of Pecola, the victim, the novel would've felt like it was asking for pity. Had it feel on her attacker, it obviously would've been much darker--without heart. A townsperson would've made it too distant. And so forth. Morrison chose wisely by going into all these characters' point-of-views.The language, as in any piece Morrison writes, is gorgeous. She can just write words on a page without a story and it will get published. Language, however, is probably the biggest problem with The Bluest Eye: it doesn't fit. Some characters in this book are clearly more eloquent, and I'll give the benefit of the doubt that they would use such language; however, there are many in this novel who are portrayed as barely being able to read and yet their narratives are laced with the author's silver-tongue. It doesn't make the novel any less beautiful; but it certainly makes it less effective. Taken in context however--her first novel, written as a 30-something black woman in 1960s America--I'm guessing there was great pressure, internally and externally, to create a work of greatly literary value.While Morrison doesn't quite match the power in this novel as she does with later works, The Bluest Eye is nevertheless a wonderful start to what was to become an exceptional career.Show more"

Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor.- Toni Morrison, The Bluest EyeThe Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison can be described from a lot of literary critical points of view - post-colonial, psycho-analyical, feminist, marxist and so on.This book shows that repression has to break free, in one way or the other. And, it is not guaranteed that the repressed people themselves will not be victims of their own acts of freedom. Pecola is a victim of another victim Cholly in particular and her African-American community in general.The definition of ideal beauty or the White Beauty plays an important role in this book. The seemingly innocent things, such as the Shirley Temple mugs and dolls, create an inferiority complex in an African-American girl Pecola. Commerce has been criticized as an Ideological State Apparatus and an instrument to create hegemony by Morrison in this book. Having blue eyes is the ideal model of beauty to Pecola. She does not wish for a white complexion along with the blue eyes. It shows that her wish is not a conscious decision, rather an unconscious one.The most striking writing technique is the choice of narrators in this book. Nothing is more shocking to the readers than realizing that such sensitive topics are narrated by 10 and 11 years old girls, Claudia and Pecola.Show more"

Morrison, de manera ejemplar, muestra cómo se han establecido de manera, aparentemente, inamovible los estereotipos de belleza y bienestar dentro de la sociedad (profundamente racista y machista) en la que vivimos.

Llena de ironía y de agrio sarcasmo, Toni Morrison da cuenta del mundo racista que se ha implantado en nuestra vida cotidiana. En suma, Ojos Azules es una crítica poderosa al racismo, a los imaginarios establecidos y a la segregación social que se desprende de los mismos. Relato doloroso, real ( dolorosamente real), crítico y que invita a la profunda reflexión, cierro con una cita de Morrison sobre esta obra que me ha parecido bastante sintética:""No quería que el lector tuviera tiempo para preguntarse ""¿qué tengo que hacer, o dejar de hacer, para leer esto?"", ""¿qué defensa necesito ,qué distancia he de mantener?"".

The perspective of the narrative, from young girls who witnessed one tragedy after another befall one of their peers is not even close to encompassing what this book is about. It has a rawness that's piercing and honestly has left me without a voice. The self-loathing, how it starts, how it shapes our conduct and decisions, how a child, like Pecola becomes a victim not just to others, but herself. How people who look like her, young black girls, have experienced similar attitudes about their hair, skin, even the way you speak, can internalize their reactions to such and spit it like venom to other victims. This poison has manifested itself and many of us have been a victim to its effects. It also makes you stop and think about the times you personally, maybe unintentionally, or not, with malice or frustration in your heart, you've done to others what's been done to you. You've been Pecola, you've been mistreated because of your skin color, or you've been mocked because you aren't black enough.

I wanted to love it because I know that Toni Morrison is a great writer of the modern era and that the themes she tackles in this book are important. However, I just found the novel to be super confusing. Like other readers, I was frustrated with the fact that it seemed every character’s perspective was shared but Pecola’s. I feel like I would’ve connected emotionally with Pecola and her story more if I had gotten to see her thought process as these rejections and traumatic events took place. I would’ve liked to directly witness her decent into idealization rather than just be told it by other characters. Other readers have pointed out that this may be Morrison’s attempt to show just how isolated and voiceless Pecola felt or how much people truly discounted her as a person. This theory makes a lot of sense but doesn’t change my disappointment.I feel like this book has left me with emotions that I probably won’t fully understand until way after I’ve moved on and began reading other books. Or possibly until I reread it at a different point in my life where I’m perhaps wiser.

Toni Morrison selbst sagte, die Geschichte ihres Debütromans solle nicht nur berühren, sondern bewegen. Dies ist bei mir jedenfalls gelungen. Es handelt sich um die Geschichte dreier Mädchen, die wie Morrison selbst in den 1940er Jahren in der gemischtfarbigen Arbeiterstadt Lorain, Ohio aufwachsen. Im Mittelpunkt steht dabei die Feststellung, dass sich struktureller Rassismus konkret und erbarmungslos auf Schönheitsideale und die generelle Selbstwahrnehmung schwarzer Menschen auswirkt. Es ist eine gesellschaftlich und politisch bedingte Hässlichkeit, die sich die Figuren im Roman überstülpen, Hässlichkeit, die aus Hass herrührt.

The language was rich and thick, with descriptions and metaphors that made me gasp with awe—how does Morrison write the world like this? I LOVED the vascular storytelling about Pecola; it shrinks her perspective and emboldens the histories of those around her to determine the dispersed origin of her extreme self-hatred. The swelling of other stories and the restriction of Pecola’s own perspective as an avenue to extrapolate her was so intriguing to read.

Maybe because I used to have color complex issues as a child and I was molested at a young age. I could relate to Pecola.

This helps us understand their actions (and we are free to like or dislike them).

An undeniable tragedy, a complex tragedy, a very American tragedy, but also a very particular/specific story told by an absolute master. This book is going to stay with me.“Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live.”This book could have just been simply an emotion-tugging, tear-jerking, victimizing tale, but it is so much more because of the way Morrison approached it. Morrison encapsulates the innocence of the main character as a young black female without a strong support system, in fact those that should protect her were already too broken themselves, feeding her the ideas of self-loathing to Pecola, because it's what they themselves knew, these are American messages. Morrison set Pecola at the heart of the story, but she barely speaks on the page, friends of hers as narrators are able to provide a perspective that she would never be able to articulate herself, it makes spectators of us all. In this story I think what we recognize is that we all fail the Pecolas of the world - the blame lies with us. “All of us--all who knew her--felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even her waking dreams we used--to silence our own nightmares.”This is writing that engages peoples hearts and minds, their empathy and compassion... and yet some would like to take the works of Morrison off of shelves, out of libraries. Our indifference is part of the tragedy, but the willful actions of those that would like to keep people ignorant and unempathetic. Also, just a note that this was Morrison's first novel which is unfathomable to me, and then there is the fact that she writes immense complexity in conjunction with incredible economy, it is truly a masterpiece.

Good heavens, it happens to all types of girls here. Why would we want to keep them from understanding they deserve better?”I mean really. Ask yourself who it shields to ban a book that has incest featured (in the ennnnnddd)—mixed in with all the other bits about longing, sometimes frightening adult bits, but more often told from the pov of a child who doesn’t understand. I guarantee you, it’s not the girls we’d be protecting by banning this book. This book doesn’t celebrate it by any means. Would likely make any young woman slash and burn the man who invites her to see his kittens, rather than succumb to such a now obvious ploy. Would make any young woman who finishes the book look twice at men and their antics. And that would be good, we women must know we are not safe, God knows. (I know this from my 30 plus years of law practice, and my husband’s, as well). Would help save a few more of us from sexual abuse, maybe. So of course I decided to listen to it as I’d had the audio lingering in my TBH for a while. It’s a different encounter by audio, for certain, as are all books. I found Morrison’s note—written many years later—very interesting, how she set out to show the easy slippery slope a young Black girl might encounter, taking her to the most miserable of victims in the blink of an eye; how Morrison later felt she didn’t accomplish her goal, her effort wasn’t good enough, though she tried. How disturbed she was by an acquaintance’s wish for blue eyes, and took that as her starting premise. Should parents censor this book? That is certainly a parental choice. But I’d trust it more if they tell me they can sit their young women down and tell them that bad things can—will—happen to them, and that the girls will understand. (They can’t; they won’t!). I’d trust it more, maybe, if they tell me that they didn’t read VC Andrew’s books at the same age, which did glamorize incest, and goodness what point did those books make (and are those books [which are making a come back!] by a white female author, on these ban lists?). That they’ve read this book; they’ve read Toni Morrison, a national treasure who won the Nobel Prize and the Pulitzer Prize and who wrote literary works—beautiful, tragic, meaningful, difficult. I’d trust the objections if they tell me they haven’t given little June and little Johnny TVs and cell phones and the wide, dark internet, and apps and… I’d trust it more if they could tell me about the story of incest in the Bible, and what purpose that serves, and…People, I beg you to think. And Let your young adults think. They do anyway, whether you admit it or not. Better yet, let them grow critical thinking skills by letting them read writers like Toni Morrison and letting the conversation from books like this happen. Let them learn more, understand more about Black lives, about girls, about longings. We will be better for it.Show more"

It's horrible. This book explores some real dark parts of humanity, and I don't think I'd recommend it to most people.First of all: Toni Morrison is an incredible author. I feel criminally deprived that, when I was making my way through modern and contemporary writers in high school, nobody handed me one of her books. Maybe I wasn't ready. Maybe they didn't know; it's likely. Thank God I got here.As a writer, her prose is astounding; her characters are believable and compelling, her storytelling is enthralling. It's phenomenal. Toni Morrison has more than earned her rightful place with those other big names of southern literature.The Bluest Eye is remarkable for all those reasons above. It is strongly and powerfully written. It demands attention and change in the reader. I imagine encountering this in 1970 would have been a major confrontation. Today, it's still a major confrontation. It is sickening. And I think it's supposed to be. In the version I read, Toni wrote a foreward in which she explains that she wanted to make you feel the humanity of the villains. Well, it worked. I hate it. But I think for the most part I respect it, understand it, and felt that while it showed the awful, it didn't wallow in it. It accomplished it's purpose. For the most part. I think it does wallow in it a few times, especially with the introduction and elucidation of a previously unseen character nearly at the end of the book. If there's one specific problem with the book, it's this. It is unnecessary and too long, as well as overly explicit without a good reason. One additional complaint I'll add that there are several times skips/retellings throughout the book, which may be purposeful and intended to convey something, but felt amateur and caused confusion for me. The combination of over the top shocks and unclear timelines make the book feel like a first book. The deeply disturbing and explicit character exploration bring down the rating. The strength of the story and the writing bring it back up. It makes sense that the person who wrote this would go on to write Beloved, which is one of the best books I've read in a long time; and it also seems like they need to develop further as a writer. So, all that is to say, this book is 3 stars, and I can't wait to read more of her work.Show more"

Film shows you one way to see it, an artistic method which has its own value. Reading, though, enlists more of your imagination in that process of stepping into someone else’s shoes, seeing with their eyes. And there is a direct line of communication between the eye and the soul.Morrison is one of the greatest U.S. American writers. She innovates on Faulkner’s dynamic narrative approach, jumping around timelines, perspectives, tones, and writing styles to form a story that is less like a chronology and more like a tapestry. This strategy complements a core motivation of her writing: to tell the story of the weak and marginalized, those who are “Other” in U.S. society. Yet her focus goes beyond the events in their lives and into their experience; what is it like to be the Other, and why is it like that? In The Bluest Eye, as in some of her other novels, Morrison accomplishes this through focusing on a young, poor, black woman whose race, socioeconomic status, gender, family history, and local context form a black hole of oppression. It’s just so hard to break out of the pull.When reading The Bluest Eye, the reader sees and imagines the world through the Other’s eyes. This generates empathy, but Morrison doesn’t leave us there. She simultaneously helps us see beyond the eyes of the Other to understand that which makes them Other, the abuse, sexism, racism, distorted sexuality, economic/political/social injustice... Reading Morrison, then, isn’t about despair in the face of these forces. Rather, it’s about rejection, a rejection of the unjust and Othering influences and desires that exist both in our world and within us. It’s easier to fight what you can see. In this way, The Bluest Eye is as valuable and transformative as it is painful and disturbing.""So let's make it a miracle.""Show more"

It follows the lives of a black family in Ohio during the 1940s, particularly Pecola who wishes to have blue eyes to be 'beautiful'. We follow an ensemble of characters however, jumping through time, 1st to 3rd perspective and offering a real and human evaluation of how every character arrived at the position they are in. It assumes the reader has the comprehension to understand that this journey does not justify the person they are, that people will always do things for selfish, cruel reasons but that instead, this is a societal problem amplifying across generations, becoming stronger and stronger the longer things can fester. Race and class are central themes to this book along with gender and family dynamics exploring the concept of oppression and power. An emotional, brutal, honest book that I 100% recommend. Oh and did I mention that the prose is second to none! Morrison is one of the best I've ever read.

After growing up believing that she is hideous, she begins to obsess over acquiring ""the bluest eyes"" in order to be perceived as beautiful. The Bluest Eye explores racism and how Black children, particularly girls, are brought up with images of whiteness as the standard of beauty, leading to lifelong body image issues, internalized racism, and trauma. This book also made the top ten list of the most challenged books in schools for 2021. It's no surprise that a book about such heavy subject matter has been twisted, with its original meaning being ripped away, and ignored, by the political pawn parents. While most of this book is centered around racism, beauty standards, and colorism, it also covers subjects such as intergenerational trauma, rape, and abuse. Ultimately, everything ties back to how our Western society has made Black children feel less than, and not worthy of love. I can see why Toni Morrison is such a beloved author. Her writing is vivid, and definitely does not hold anything back. At times it was poetic and heartwarming, but in just a moment you are terrified and heartbroken. Pecola's storyline, while serving a purpose, was still very hard to read. The metaphor towards the end of the book following her rape brought tears to my eyes. This book really makes you reckon with how we treat those who aren't seen as beautiful. While I generally liked the book, and the writing, the plot felt convoluted to me at times. The prose could also be a bit heavy on the literary devices to a point where I was confused. This is definitely the kind of book that you need to read at least a second time to fully grasp everything- well, it was like that for me, anyway. Overall, I can see why so many people praise this book, and it's one that should be read by everyone, seeing as you're in the best headspace for it since it can feel a bit hopeless at times.

In The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, through the eyes of Claudia, the story of Pecola Breedlove is told. A girl perceived as ugly who begins to dream of being beautiful per the standards of whiteness. She dreams of having blue eyes and loves gazing at a cup with Shirley Temple pictured on it. It's a tragic story in which Pecola never seems to find the self-acceptance and self-love that she's missing.I loved the parts of this told from Claudia's perspective about Pecola or Claudia and her sister, Freida. My focus drifted during the other scenes that weren't focused on any of the above three. What was still shown in this novel is Toni Morrison's fantastically nuanced characters - the good, bad, the ugly, and the beautiful of them. I definitely intend to keep reading more Toni Morrison in the weeks and months to come. Rating: 3.5 / 5Show more"

The first line of this novel: ""Quiet as it’s kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father’s baby that the marigolds did not grow."" What??? GORGEOUS. PROVOCATIVE. HEARTBREAKING. Toni Morrison writes poetry in novel form. Each sentence is chock-full of this insanely vivid language, these unlikely combinations of words, and I was constantly rereading full paragraphs in order to properly notice her talent. I read one review that said that although this book is poetry, it is also history, sociology and nightmare ... and that really rings true for me. White beauty standards have always ruled all, and they cause irreparable damage to young girls and women who may not exactly adhere to them. So much beauty goes to waste, goes unnoticed, because we have all been socialized to idolize the bluest eyes, the blondest hair, the slimmest white bodies ... and that's still so true today, even 50 years after this book was published. I am so sad for Toni Morrison's elementary-school friend who inspired this book, who craved blue eyes so badly. Shirley Temple was cute, sure, but she wasn't everything. A black girl's world should be everything, too. One particularly painful line: ""She looks up at him and sees the vacuum where curiosity ought to lodge. And something more. The total absence of human recognition—the glazed separateness.""A difficult read, but a necessary one. Reading more of her ASAP!! C u next time :)Show more"

It gave a really good impression from near the start, especially when the author began writing dialog. Her dialog, and (some of) her characterizations are very impressive. Some of her more abstract pronouncements in the author's voice are intriguing when they are undeveloped, they get the reader interested it seeing where they will go. I had mixed feelings, but a lot of hope going forward. At times there's some real honesty and understanding of some of the people, even when other characterizations are not quite right. And the author dares to give her protagonist some questionable attitudes, she's far from an angel, she gives voice to some of her own prejudices. There's humor too. But things started to go a bit wrong when I noticed there's an inconsistency in how the protagonist (and many others) seems to fluctuate from having an overly mature, overly adult perspective grafted onto her by means of the author's reflections, and the other extreme in which she's naive beyond my ability to believe.Relative to this last comment, I'll cut and paste something I jotted down earlier by way of notes:--------------------On the one hand, it does make an interesting reversal of expectation to compare the narrating Claudia and the more tragic Pecola. The younger Claudia, who generally lives a life that's not too bad except for an overly strict mom who's a bit zany with her habit of speaking her bitter thoughts aloud, is much more cynical and angry, and prone to fight and get overly jealous. Pecola, who knows REAL hard times and REAL horrible family circumstances is the meeker, more humble one, and she doesn't tend to complain or lash out. So, okay, that's a kind of interesting and good dynamic. At the same time, one sometimes questions where Claudia got her anger and why she's different from those around her, especially with regards to racial awareness and attitudes about white and light-skinned folks. Sometimes Claudia seems to have inheritted an adult, more-knowing attitude, as a sort of projection backwards from the author to an exceptionally precocious child. Yet, she can sometimes be more naive than we can even reasonably expect of a nine-year-old, especially considering what she must have heard from her mother, older sister, and peers. E.g., what starts as a kind of absurd joke gets a little carried away when she responds to her sister's concern that she may be ""ruined"" by a sexual harrassment incident... she thinks ""ruined"" puts her in a class with a fat prostitute they know... but then she misinterprets this as meaning that Freida will get fat, that's what ""ruined"" means... only she refers to other skinny prostitutes as ""ruined"" too, so seemingly she *does* understand... only she doesn't because she thinks that the way to avoid being ruined=fat is to drink whisky because that's what keeps the other prostitutes skinny... only... wait, this initial joke is actually supposed to be taken seriously to the extent that not only she but her older sister thinks so... hmmm...And well, sometimes I don't know whether it's a good thing or a bad thing when characters (again, particularly claudia) have ideas and attitudes which I'm not sure where they came from. I just can't always decide when it's a problem of the author using characters for her own mouthpiece, and when it's a reflection of the really quirky nature of people. I think at various times it's one, then the other.-------------------------All right, getting back on track with this sloppy review, the author started to stretch too much, the characters she created and the attitude expressed became less real and less plausible as we went forward, and a lot of contempt was expressed for some of them... but they were foils, not people I could believe in.It's perhaps admirable that she tried to give some sense, or some life, or some understanding to the psychology of the more villainous characters, but I think she really just didn't understand her own characters. Cholly is one, and worse is Soaphead.The book, for me, turned into a shambles as it started to approach its climax, and then added bizarre reflections on caricatured and implausible people.I hate to come down so hard on this, because at the high points, with all the promise that appeared at first, the book looks brilliant. It's easy to see why it has impressed so many readers, and why it should stand out as a remarkable debut novel.Other gripes: Sometimes when a traumatic event is referred to in vague terms in the early phases of the book, it seems poignant and effective. When the author revisits the events in detail later, the events and the reflections on character psychology... well, they go off the rails and make one wish that she had left them well enough alone without the need to approach so closely.Perhaps we could also say the author takes some gambles... she strives to be impressive in her phrasing, her use of similes and metaphors, and sometimes she pulls it off brilliantly (though I'm not a big fan of similes and metaphors, usually)... then, increasingly towards the end, she pulls it off awkwardly and I'd wish for fewer attempts at cleverness.Oh, hell, I'm just going to stop trying to get my thoughts all orderly now. I should have left it at one phrase: ""brilliant promise, not fully realized.""Show more"

However, for me her true mastery came through in the dialogue, which shot off the page with so much life as to require zero description or setting, letting the reader feel every kind of emotion and personality and inner struggle just through the words of each character. Like the last book I read, the frequent shifts in perspective and voice style did leave me confused sometimes, but I let the current take me and was so moved overall that I have to give this five stars.Show more"

The Bluest Eye caught my attention and I am so glad it did.The review on the cover by the New York Times reads: ""So charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry"", and it sums this book up perfectly. Toni Morrison writes about extremely tough situations and issues while simultaneously using language that keeps everything readable and almost pleasant(???). I was fully captivated from page one. And then there's the prose, which is so mind bogglingly beautiful I had to reread several passages multiple times to attempt to stamp them into my brain. I cannot rave about this book enough. Read it, read it, read it and think about it and understand what you are reading and learn about the world we live in and the power of literature.

This book has left me thinking over certain themes for days. I think the best thing I can say about any book is that I can't stop thinking about it. ""The Bluest Eye"" was so hard to read in parts that I honestly was surprised when I got to the ending because even though it was hard to read, I wanted it to keep going and going. I wanted to read my happy ending damn it, and sadly there was no happy ending at all, just reality. The novel focuses for the most part on two young girls, Claudia MacTeer and Pecola Breedlove. Claudia and Pecola go to school together, but Claudia gets to know Pecola more when Pecola temporarily is housed with the MacTeer family after Pecola's father burns their home down. Besides the story weaving back and forth between Claudia and Pecola. We also have POVs from Pecola's mother (Pauline), father (Cholly) and even a young boy who ends up harassing Pecola. Claudia is at times portrayed as the narrator of Pecola's story and other times she is narrating what is going on with her and her sister Frieda. What made this book interesting to me is the differences between Claudia and Pecola. Claudia is growing up starting to despise anything that is different than her and particularly hates the white baby dolls she is given. She wants to take them apart, open them up, and squash them. Claudia hates these things because they are showing her that she is not enough, her blackness, her brown eyes are all wrong/ugly. We don't really get many details about what Claudia looks like, but it seems to me that she is at least more attractive than what Pecola and her family look like.Pecola who is called ugly even by her own mother longs to become white and have blue eyes. To her, being white with blue eyes would make her beautiful and would make everything in her world right. Pecola's entire history is tragic from beginning to end and all I wanted to do was hug this fictional girl and tell her it's going to be okay. Pauline's character I could sympathize with at times, but she was as part of the problem as was Cholly. Pauline and Pecola actually had a lot in common, both of them dreaming of better things, though in Pauline's case she ends up seeing her job as a maid, babysitter, housekeeper to a rich white family as the best thing in her life. The character of Cholly was so hard to sympathize with though Morrison shows you the layers to this character as well. You get to see his start in life and see how for him everything turned out wrong. In his case though, it was easier to drink, get in fights, and lash out at others instead of taking a hard look at himself. Morrison's book really takes a hard look at how not only do the way that whites perceive African Americans has a cause and effect, but the way that other African Americans perceive each other can have a negative cause and effect. I am fairly light skinned and I got crapped on all of the time as a kid for being ""yellow"". Girls got crapped on for being dark-skinned though dark-skinned boys did not. Apparently being a neutral brown skinned African American was the best bet for you. I didn't think at the time as a kid how we were segregating ourselves into what we consider most beautiful and least attractive, but as kids we did that. I am wondering now if were doing this based on what the adults around us were doing as well. Claudia who is a tough little thing already seemed wise to the world. Pecola was fragile and needed defending. I was hoping for a time that Claudia would swoop in and be Pecola's friend, but once again, kids are loathe to go and attract any unwanted negative attention to themselves and once again I applaud Morrison for highlighting that.I said it one of my updates that Morrison's writing at times reminded me of what I would call the ""inner"" chapters of John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Morrison's writing took on an almost haunting, singing quality when she would break down the African American community (children, girls, boys, women, men) and use that to introduce a POV that would play into what she was going to be introducing. This books takes place sometime after the Great Depression in Ohio. Reading about the differences between neighborhoods (black and white) and even between black people themselves made me think back about my hometown. It was set up pretty much the same way. My parents were actually in a fairly affluent racially diverse neighborhood. It wasn't until I was in college that I saw that for the most part that many of our formerly white neighbors had been replaced by other African Americans and even some of the older African Americans I had known had left. The ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion before you get there. I do like how Claudia wraps up the narration with her acknowledging how she and the community as a whole had failed Pecola.

Glavni lik ovog romana je devojčica Pekola Bridlav, koja će biti gošća neko vreme jednoj beloj porodici. Naime, Pekolin otac, nasilni alkoholičar Čoli je spalio kuću i završio u zatvoru. Upravo iz razloga što više nemaju dom, majka, Pekola i njen brat Sem će biti razdvojeni na neko vreme. Pekola će biti poslata da živi sa porodicom belaca Mektir, koju osim oca i majke čine i dve devojčice njenih godina, Klaudija i Frida. Ono što Pekolu posebno opisuje, osim činjenice da je crnkinja jeste ružnoća. Ona je opisana kao izuzetno ružna devojčica, sa ružnim zubima, a to joj stvara problem ne samo u školi već u celokupnoj zajednici. Kada se na to doda činjenica da je crnkinja, da je potomak pijanice i da potiče iz siromašne porodice, postaje očigledno da društvo iz njene okoline neće biti baš tolerantno. Kako bi dokazala njenu ružnoću, Toni Morison ubacuje i lik devojčice Morin Pil, koja je takođe tamnije kože, ali s ozbirom na to da je lepa i da potiče iz fine porodice crnaca (koliko je porodica crnaca mogla biti okarakterisana kao fina u to vreme), ona nema problema.Ovo su razlozi zbog kojih će Pekola će stvoriti poseban kompleks niže vrednosti, i ostvariće posebnu želju da ima plave oči. Plave oči je ono što Pekola smatra lepim, jer to društvo smatra lepim i američkim. Uzimajuću kao primer lutke koje su se u tom trenutku proizvodile u Americi, i koje imaju uglavnom plave oči, Toni Morison će oslikati sliku jedne klasične američke porodice belaca, u kojoj su svi plavi i imaju plave oči, lepe poslove, lepe kuće, i žive život na kakvom bi mnogi pozavideli. Sam roman počinje delom iz knjiga o Dik i Džejn, što su bile udžbenici koji su se koristili u školama sve do osamdesetih godina kada su ih skinuli s programa jer su reklamirali pogrešne američke vrednosti. I Dik i Džejn su deca klasičnog “američkog” izgleda – plavi, beli, lepi, lepo obučeni. Knjige o Dik i Džejn se i dan danas smatraju pogrešnim načinom vaspitavanja dece u to vreme u Americi, i stoje kao, možda ne glavni, ali definitivno jedan od sporednih razloga za segregaciju crnaca i drugih kultura među decom u tom periodu.Pekolino detinjstvo, rasa pa i izgled će biti tri stvari koje će joj odlučiti sudbinu. Iako mala, čitalac može da saoseća sa njom, i da zajedno sa Pekolom ali i Klaudijom i Frejom navija da dobro pobedi zlo. Ipak, roman Najplavlje oko, iako fikcija, nije naučna fantastika, tako da možete očekivati baš ono što se malim crncima (na sve to ružnim) dešavalo u manjim sredinama. Roman počinje Klaudijinim obraćanjem čitaocu objašnjavajući da je Pekola zatrudnela sa svojim ocem, ne objašnjavajući kako se to desilo i šta se tačno desilo sa bebom. Posle toga nas Toni vodi u prošlost, kada Pekola tek dolazi u porodicu Mektir. Osim Pekole i njene porodice (posebno oca i majke) koji predstavljaju nižu klasu afroamerikanaca, i Mektir porodice koja stoji kao porodica belaca iz srednje klase, roman obiluje dobrim likovima iz različitih sfera, kao što su na primer prostitutke ili perverznjak Henri koji će zakupiti sobu kod Mektirovih. Svaki od ovih likova u romanu je poseban, i apsolutno svaki je savršeno razrađen. Ne postoji lik koji je loše predstavljen u ovom romanu, jer je Morison svakom dala baš ono što bi trebalo da ima kako bi ovaj roman bio to što jeste. U jednom trenutku ćemo se malo detaljnije upoznati sa prošlošću Pekoline majke Poline i njenog oca Čolija, i shvatićemo šta je to iz njihovih prošlosti što je uticalo na neke njihove postupke iz sadašnjosti.Kao što i sama Toni Morison kaže u predgovoru, glavna tema ovog romana nije samo rasizam, već i lepota. Lepota kao takva i šta je to što karakteriše lepotu. Ko je osoba koja će reći da je nešto lepo ili ružno, i da li je lepota u oku posmatrača, ili u oku jedne zajednice koja zajedničkim snagama odlučuje šta je lepo a šta ne? Kada na sve to dodamo temu rasizma u Americi, pedofilije, seksualnog uznemiravanja i vršnjačkog nasilja, dobijamo roman koji je zaista izuzetno bitan ne samo sa književne, već i sa sociološke strane.Toni Morison je uspela da napiše jedan savršeni roman, koji je na momente preduhovit, na momente sladak, na momente gorak a na momente srceparajuć. Da, ovaj roman preporučujem svima. Na kraju krajeva nije ni bitno da li imate stomak za eksplicitne scene ili ne – njih nema toliko, niti su toliko eksplicitne – a verujem da će ostatak romana da Vam otvori oči i da ćete razmišljati o njemu dugo nakon pročitane poslednje strane.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33062312-preri,The Bluest Eye,Rating 3 out of 5,"September 3, 2020",5 likes,0,"I genuinely am so sad to say that this novel did not meet my expectations. I fully expected to have some sort of emotional connection to the novel or at the very least, be intoxicated by the writing and moved by the content.That isn't to say that I was not moved by the content. I found her message passionate and integral in current society. However, I was put out by the writing style and the way she almost forced her message down my throat. I do understand that there are readers out there who have fallen in love with Morrison's writing, and I don't begrudge them that. Her writing is quality, and she clearly has talent and experience. However, I simply could not connect to it because as I mentioned before, I felt as if she was kind of forcing her message down my throat. I think that in itself is not bad, especially looking at why she chose to create her story like this, but the writing style just was not my favorite.Take the following quote as an example. The context is that there are a bunch of young black boys who start to insult and bully Pecola, the main character. This is how the interaction is described.

""Black e mo. Black e mo. Yadaddsleepsnekked. Black e mo black e mo ya dadd sleeps nekked. Black e mo . . .""They had extemporized a verse made up of two insults about matters over which the victim had no control: the color of her skin and speculations on the sleeping habits of an adult, wildly fitting in its incoherence. That they themselves were black, or that their own father had similarly relaxed habits was irrelevant. It was their contempt for their own blackness that gave the first insult its teeth. 

Now, look, I don't know about you, but when I read what the boys were saying, it was very clear to me what their two insults were: you're black and your dad sleeps naked. Seeing as the boys were black, I, as a person with common sense and inferential skills, deduced that they were bullying Pecola out of a sense of self-loathing and self-hatred. I did not need Morrison to explicitly lay that out for me. In fact, for me, it detracted from the power of the scene by telling me what she wanted me to see. Yet I also understand why she chose to write in such a way. I very much acknowledge the importance of being so explicit because so many people still choose to ignore the blatant racism that still exists. I simply think the writing style was not for me.Similar descriptions happened all the time in the book. A powerful scene or maybe even just a regular scene would be described and then Morrison would say something stupidly explicit like, He abused her because he himself had been abused as a child. Or, He became an alcoholic because he didn't know how to escape his tragic life. Or, She hated Shirley Temple because she was blonde and white and she wanted black representation in the media.Like, we get it, Morrison. We literally ARE NOT stupid.Furthermore, there were odd transitions in POV, which I completely understand was a deliberate choice on Morrison's part, but it completely detracted from the progression of the novel to me. I know that I may have an unpopular opinion on this novel, but it's really only related to how it was written rather than the content of the novel.The last and biggest thing that I want to discuss is this: what does Morrison propose we do for the problems she stated? She discussed a lot of issues: domestic abuse, rape, incest, internalized racism, self-hatred, external racism, colorism, economic inequality, physical beauty standards, etc. I completely agree that these are extremely prevalent issues and that they need to be recognized in society. But what I did not get is what Morrison wants us to do about it. Everything ends on such a tragic note that honestly, it made me hopeless. I see no way for us to really get out of this cycle of horribleness. This was honestly a really bleak novel. Maybe that was the point? To make us feel the helplessness that people who suffer everyday from these issues feel? Overall, I think the main reason why I was so disappointed with this novel is that I had such high expectations going into it. I'm sure there are other people who absolutely love this novel, and I definitely see why they do. This was not the book, however, for me.Show more"

'the bluest eye' confronts the ""thing that made her (maureen) beautiful"", the belief of blackness as ugly due our distance to whiteness and the harm in seeing ourselves in a lens not meant for us, a strictly eeurocentric lens. it also tackles how black men perpetuate a subconscious hatred for black women, hurting their identities, their worthiness and their physical value in society - abusing themselves and abusing black women conveniently as punching bags for their own relief of black male trauma, very much explored in cholly's background. morrison lectures the black community too, who has failed themselves in certain spheres we thought trivial (when it actually bares immense consequences to ourselves consciously and subconsciously), for exemple: the lack of open love and tenderness. by the end, pecola gains a false sense of confidence and self-love as she gains her blue eyes by the witch doctor (he's a witch doctor i dont fucking care), through the seemingly positive self-talk in which she is still looking, begging for white validation. we, in revenge, are presented to us this: without recognizing the harm in white conformity - without true self-acceptance, obtained through the practice of loving our black features even if we do not actually and currently love them as we practice - we are doomed to perpetuate the black trauma instilled into us, which will inevitably appear first through beauty. morrison has given us a special set of blues eyes too with this treasure of a debut novel, so black girls could see their beauty or at least try to let go of the belief of their ""ugliness"" rooted in blackness. this book is the true blue eye. they are brown, even pitch black, and they are truly gorgeous.

I plan on reading all of her bibliography in order. I was not disappointed. I enjoyed this sad sad book. The theme of internal racism is prevalent throughout the book, even in the title. I marked so many pages that really spoke to me. It is interesting to see that internalized anti-blackness has not changed at all. The only gripe I had with the novel was the chapter layout. Since I couldn't give the novel my full attention and had to leave it for days at a time, I found the narration switch from third to first person was somewhat difficult to follow at times.brief thoughts and quotes: Their [Breedlove] ugliness was unique. No one could have convinced them that they were not relentlessly and aggressively ugly...The rest of the family... wore their ugliness.The character of Mrs. Breedlove and her religious fervour was humorous while also showing the hypocrisy of many Christians. As stated in the novel, she's not interested in Christ the Redeemer but Christ the Judge. She does not want any salvation for her wretched, ugly husband, rather she wants to see him struck down. She holds no mercy or sympathy for her children, all of it is wrapped up in her employer's kid. Pecola hurt my heart, every situation involving her made me frustrated and sad. Every character in the story is flawed, badly. I loved this book because of that reason. It's real sh*t.""I felt a need for someone to want the black baby to live-- just to counteract the universal love of white baby dolls, Shirley Temples, and Maureen Peals."" side note: I might be hallucinating but I'm pretty sure that a scrapbook or scrapbooks were mentioned in this novel (unfortunately I can't find the page/quote).

This was one of the primary materials used in school to teach children how to read. If you take a look at it, you'll find a neat little book with plenty of illustrations. However, all the pictures, with no exception, were of white children and white families. This racially-selective work was used all over the States to educate children who, at that age, were hardly anything more than a blank slate. And it is through such practices that marginalized kids, like Pecola, could not form and nurture an accurate representation of self, and were instead filled with self-loathing and a wild desire to be something else; to have Blue Eyes. The novel parallels the childhoods of Pecola Breedlove and Claudia MacTeer; two infant black girls whose early years were difficult in a biased and racist community. But although hard to bear, Claudia's predicaments were not impossible to surmount. She had had a sister and a more or less functional family that prevented her misery from reaching overwhelming peaks. Her father, for example, defended her sister when the latter had been sexually harassed, whereas Pecola's had raped his own child. The unfortunate circumstances of the latter had left her with no one to turn to. Her father raped her, her mother abused her, her brother deserted the house, and her friends had followed the steps of their elders and simply ignored her. In this manner, Pecola was alienated and thrust deeper and deeper into estrangement and invisibility. Although the novel is told from different perspectives, it begins with a narrative voice that is easily identifiable as Claudia's, or rather an adult version of her, who tells the story of her childhood friend, wishing all the while there could be something she could do for her, and knowing at the same time that all she could do was to write her story in a desperate belated attempt to draw her out of the invisibility and psychological break down into which she had fallen long ago. The plot runs through parts, each one associated with a season. The Autumn section begins, accordingly, with Claudia and her sister Frieda's envy of their next door neighbor Rosemary Villanucci, who is taunting them with the superiority of her family's economic position while sitting in her father's car. The sister respond by beating the girl the moment she's out of the vehicle. Rosemary immediately offers to pull down her underwear in defense, and her neighbors decline and walk way. This episode of childhood foolery is very significant in that it suggests that it was not the first time that Rosemary had offered her body and sexuality as a means to shield herself from physical abuse, most probably domestic. In the same section, the Macteer family receive two people into their household; a boarder named Mr. Henry, and Pecola Breedlove whose father had burnt his own house down. The latter guest is left to the care of the two Macteer girls, and soon Claudia detaches herself from her companions by dint of her indifference to white children. Her own feelings on the matter seem to be opposed by the entire community, black and white. Claudia cannot understand why are white girls more desirable and more loved than black ones, and so in order to find out, she destroys the white doll she receives at Christmas in order to pry open the secret of its universal popularity and desirability. Together with the episode of the doll, Claudia reflects rebellion against the norms of her community in desiring a different Christmas celebration and less nightly baths. In the nick of time, however, the societal mold cuts off the edges of her individuality, and teaches her to conform. After that, the novel shifts focus towards the Breedlove household. The house is unprepossessing, the furniture is torn apart, the family members embody the opposite of the fictional Dick and Jane family. They are poor and black, and so cannot find, anywhere around them, a positive affirmation of their reality. As a result, they see themselves as ugly. The equally blinded members of their community only see the same. This seclusion, both racial and financial, finds its way to the nucleus of the family, and transforms abuse, in all its forms, into the only means of communication between the parents and children. While Sammy, Pecola's brother, finds refuge in constant eloping, the girl directs all the rage and anger of her parents towards the inside, and ends up loathing herself, and wishing for blue eyes that would be her ticket to the brighter world of Dick and Jane. The only people to acknowledge Pecola as a human being are the prostitutes living above her house; in other words a different kind of outcasts. Whiteness as a requirement of beauty comes again to the fore in the section entitled Winter, when a new light-skinned, green-eyed girl named Maureen arrives in town and enrolls in school alongside the Macteers girls. The arrival of this girl puts Pecola on the lower end of the spectrum of beauty with Maureen on the upper one. Freida and Claudia fit somewhere in between, but grapple all the same with the notion that standardized beauty makes people more valuable, desirable, and powerful. Morrison's adherence to the principles of the Black Arts Movement is apparent in the characters of Geraldine who had assimilated and completely conformed to the ideal constructions of the dominant culture; a course made as ugly and inhumane as the suffering of Pecola in this woman's house, and the fact that the latter's affections were tampered with to the extent of putting her cat above all human interactions. The spring section of the novel negates the traditional high hopes which come with the budding of new flowers. Here Pecola burns herself, and the only response she manages to extract from her mother is anger. The latter's poverty and standardized ugliness had convinced her that the only love-worthy people are white like the white girl of the family she serves, and love-worthy objects are the shiny and plentiful riches of the upper class. All that falls out of this category is, accordingly, not worthy of affection including her own daughter. In the early days of her marriage, Mrs. Breedlove had also tried to conform to the dominant culture, but when she broke a tooth eating candy she turned towards the role of wronged wife instead, trying to justify her psychological state by blaming everything on her husband. The latter's life, however, is yet another episode of bleak neglect and abandonment first by his mother, and finally by his father. His first sexual act had been tainted by humiliation when hunters forced him to go on as they watched. But since he was powerless against them, he turned his anger instead towards the girl. Thus, for as long as he lived, he confused and mixed love with violence, and inflicted them on all the people he cared about. Another character is introduced to the story, namely the pedophile psychic Soapehead Church. He, too, places the light-skinned people at the top of the social hierarchy with the blacks as a base. As a light-skinned black man, he fits somewhere in the middle, and holds himself as a superior being to his black brethren. When Pecola comes to him in quest of blue eyes, however, he is genuinely moved and writes a letter to God; the echoes of which can be faintly heard in Alice Walker's The Color Purple. At the end of the book, Pecola is left with her alter personality which comes to the fore after the rape, and supplies details suggesting that Cholly Breedlove has raped his daughter more than once. The psychological wound of the latter is irretrievable, and Claudia ends her narrative by stating that Pecola had been the victim of her environment, and yet was ignored because she had never made it to the standardized level of beauty. As black, poor, and ugly, no body cared what became of her. Thus ends the story of Pecola; a child rejected by both white and black and confined to the nowhere land where she witherd and declined hopelessly. Though the novel is about her, she remains for the most part voiceless relying on other characters to speak for her, even when they misunderstand her. Show more"

It���s expertly crafted and all the characters, even the villains, are drawn with sympathy. Their humanity is understood. The terrible things some of them do are not condoned, but the generational trauma, pain, rage, humiliation, lack of resources and internalized self-hatred that lead to their choices is explained. This is the story of Picola Breedlove, as witnessed by two neighbor girls. Picola’s fondest wish is to have blue eyes, she thinks this will make her beautiful and acceptable. It’s heartbreaking, the deep belief in their own ugliness so many of the characters have, which is one of the terrible costs of white supremacy and European beauty standards.Picola is shy and gentle and yearns for love. Her home is full of domestic violence. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her mother gives as good as she gets, while taking refuge in church-going morality. Picola is contrasted with the two scrappy sisters whose family take her in briefly when her home situation becomes untenable. The story is told from the eldest’s point of view. Their family is poor and struggling, but still has love and self respect, and the girls, especially the eldest, who gets angry easily in reaction to all the injustice and colorism she sees around her, will fight off bullies and mean girls.We also get to know a variety of neighborhood residents. I particularly enjoyed the unapologetic, man-hating prostitutes that befriend Picola.The residents of Picola’s Black neighborhood are contrasted with the richer Whites many of them work for, and the differences in situation and attitude are both wrenching and thought provoking. Picola’s mother is a housekeeper for a White family and lavishes all her love, care and organization on them, while doing the bare minimum for her own family. We learn about her girlhood, hopes and courtship, and we watch as young love self-destructs in the face of poverty, racist power structures which steal job opportunities and addiction.Picola is raped by her father. We know this to start out with, as she’s pregnant in the beginning of the story but looses the baby, and the sisters reflect back on what’s happened to try and figure things out. The rape scene is about 3/4 thru the book and is terrible but not graphic.The entire story is brilliantly framed with a children’s nursery rhyme, and the lines take on different significance throughout the story.This is not an easy read but it is an important one.

That she is unworthy of being loved. When we meet Pecola, she is eleven years old but already filled with sorrow. Her only escape from the emotional abuse that her family and her classmates heap on her is to dream that God will give her blue eyes—the kind of blue eyes Pecola has seen in pictures of the movie star Shirley Temple. If she had blue eyes, she would be pretty. If she were pretty, she would be loved. Before the narrative even begins, Morrison gives us the crux of the tale:“…there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father’s baby that the marigolds did not grow….What is clear now is that of all of that hope, fear, lust, love, and grief, nothing remains but Pecola and the unyielding earth…The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too. There is really nothing more to say—except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.”By dispensing with suspense right at the beginning, she focuses our attention on character of Pecola and on how the stories we tell about and to one another are usually the real story. What does it take for a family, a community, to break a person so completely? Part of Morrison’s genius is knowing that our cracked selves are a manifestation of a sick society. What it took to push Pecola into derangement has been building for hundreds of years throughout the history of America. This is my third time reading The Bluest Eye, and I was still shocked at how difficult it was to read. It's so tragic and full of people destroying each other in the most horrific ways. I almost put it down and gave up several times —the later scenes with Cholly, in particular—because I was just disgusted. But as always, there is an incredible beauty in her writing. For all of the operatic tragedy and looking abuse and heartache straight in the eye, there is also humor and extraordinarily complex and colorful characters. She captures the dialogue and voice of her characters so perfectly. You really get the sense of being a child eavesdropping on the delicious and forbidden conversations of the adult world. So…. a perfect novel.Show more"

I didn’t realize the appreciation I would have for someone’s writing after not reading the book for so long.  This was a very hard read. Throughout the book, I was always wondering how I was assigned this book in high school. People will react to books in a billion ways to later make me think through my reading that this was an awakening or perhaps a wake up call to life as I got older. Most people don’t like to particularly address their mental health issues, problems in their household on a day-to-day basis, or especially their feelings and emotions so easily. Toni Morrison is a ridiculously amazing author, who took time to study this situation in the personality of Pecola. As I mentioned earlier, I couldn’t recall my first read, so I was appalled at the expressive detailed writing describing physical, emotional, mental, and domestic abuse. The story is a mirror of reality to the truth of racism of 1960s America. Self confidence, self esteem, self respect, and self hatred are so poignantly explained through a beautifully created fictional character, as she thinks of herself as ugly, and through the years refuses to accept the reality of it by her constant will to have beautiful blue eyes.This book is to be read by growing ladies and mothers to remind themselves of each unique beauty that is being overlooked in today’s society as we express ourselves through fashion through models on social media. Our addictions wiped out our minds of properly thinking of ourselves as purely beautiful, “because I don’t look like the girl on the magazine cover”, perhaps to look at others and envy them for what they have that we precisely have in other ways. The essence of beauty is an eternal gift that pops out when we accept who we are and are thankful for what we have. Skin color, eye color, and outwardly characteristics of appearance are the main ways to show our inner thoughts of our inner selves. For such small book, it has taught me a lot to continue to love people equally and not differentiate them but accept them at heart.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

A window to realities I’ve always known  of , but never really known. It shows the multi-layered functioning of racism focussing on the effects of internalized racism. Morrison’s writing is as beautiful and evocative as it is harsh, raw, earthy. It moves something in your entrails. Every single word adds to the whole. Different stories are interwoven together, allowing for perspective and contextualisation—allowing you to feel compassion for the most hateful characters, like Cholly. Hardly ever have I read anything as brutal and sweet at once. It stays with you.I have read reviews which complained about the excessive brutality of the text, its absence of hope, and accused Morrison of complacent vulgarity in dwelling on descriptions of violence—scenes of rape, incest, sexual abuse, that these reviewers found unnecessary. This is not surprising considering that  The Bluest Eye  has had a long history of censorship: it’s been banned from many schools and it features among the most frequently challenged books. Therefore, a word of advice: if you are looking for happy endings and light-hearted stories, this is not the book for you. The novel dramatises an already harsh reality choosing a “unique situation, not a representative one”, and it is this extremity that allows the text to deliver such a powerful message. There aren’t always happy endings in life, and cruelty recurs in human history. If you read to escape from this, or for sheer entertainment, don’t read this novel. But if you read because you want to reach a greater awareness of the many realities and possibilities of this world, and you are willing to allow yourself to receive all that, whatever its brutality or its humanity, then this  is  the book for you.

The author reads her own works, and she does a magnificent job of it. I will be moving on to listening to more of them in the months and years ahead. I’ll take them slowly. Nothing rushed.As a start, I listened to Morrison’s first work, The Bluest Eye. It is the sorrowful tale of Pecola Breedlove, who at age eleven has met rejection in her family and her classmates. She believes that she would be beautiful and beloved if she had blue eyes. Her fantasy world is necessary because she has affirmation nowhere else, and it is a painful indictment of a world in which a bedraggled child can be swayed by images that do not include her black skin.Morrison makes us look at what happens to people whom the world has rejected. It is a painful and poignant listen. Pecola’s parents garner much of our approbation, until the narrative takes us deeper into their life experiences, and we begin to grieve for them as well. They are too damaged to give Pecola the care that might save her. Her father had been abandoned on a pile of trash by his mother. Her mother can be gentle and reasonable, but seemingly only while working for a white family. She too has bought the idea of the beauty in blue eyes. Three prostitutes are kinder to Pecola, but the dirty secret is that they have abandoned children as well.The novel unfolds with these histories, and the tenderness with which Morrison treats her characters is memorable. The authenticity of the voices, of their narratives and their dialogue – all the sound of poetry in Toni Morrison’s measured voice. Go for the audio.Show more"

Wonderful to notice more of Morrison’s humour (!!!!) this time around. —————Wow. Rest in power, Toni Morrison. Through a series of detailed character vignettes, The Bluest Eye documents the slow horror of Pecola Breedlove’s psychological unraveling. Morrison writes with devastating momentum, portraying characters who abuse, shun, mock, reject, and otherwise inflict irrevocable damage on Pecola’s psyche. But Morrison is not singular or contemptuous toward these characters, and the empathy in her writing is what makes the book feel so heavy, so real. Morrison shows the lives of Pecola’s abusers with realistic clarity — their struggles, their afflictions, their moral inclinations and failures, their rationales, their choices — while maintaining a deep critique of white supremacy.I was bowled over by the skill with which Morrison employed different narrative techniques and wrote in multiple voices and perspectives. At the time of publishing the book, this was extremely revolutionary in pushing back against a racist publishing landscape that dismissed Black vernacular/grammar/speech as “not real literature.” But it is. Has always been. And continues to be. And Toni Morrison is one of the greats paving the way for all that genius to follow.4.5/5Show more"

I wanted to cry, to smash something, to cry...the emotions roused while reading this tale by the divine Ms. Morrison are ones that in some ways come from an understanding of what it feels like to sometimes doubt your worth-especially as it relates to growing up as a black girl in America and the unsubstantiated notions that 'white' is the epitome of beauty. However, in the differences between Pecola's and Claudia's upbringings, we see the importance of involved and nurturing parents. We see the importance- no the necessity- of building our children's self esteem at a young age. Here, the book satisfied, pleased and reassured me as a parent and as a mother.

It is set in 1941 in the small town of Lorain, Ohio, and tells the story of an 11-year-old Negro girl, Pecola Breedlove, who becomes pregnant to her father Cholly. Pecola’s family and environment is such that she is certain she is ugly; so convinced of this is she, that she wishes for blue eyes, believing this is the only thing that will relieve her ugliness. Narrated in part by a 9-year-old neighbourhood girl, Claudia, the perspective of young girls in this situation is novel. Some chapters detail the history of Cholly and Mrs Breedlove, giving some clues as to how this crippled and crippling family evolved. This reissue of Morrison’s first novel includes a new Forward by the author wherein she explains what she was trying to achieve. Some of the prose is quite stunning: “Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe.

This could be a personal thing but I’m very uncomfortable reading pedophilia, child rape, rape, and sexual harassment. And there is a lot of scenes in this book. Also nearly every single guy mentioned in this book has served as some type of villain, which furthers enables the narrates of how black men are seen as aggressive and dangerous.

Pecola is a young black girl who believes she’s ugly and is made to feel that way from family and neighbors. She wishes for blue eyes in the hopes to be beautiful. I enjoyed Toni’s style of writing, but at times I found myself having a hard time following who was talking and would need to stop and figure out what was happening.Show more"

Poetic yet brutal, Pecola’s story forces the reader to confront the role they have to play in this world that tarnishes and devastates a child like Pecola, who, sadly, very much exists. Toni Morrison is a powerful writer with the ability to rattle the bones of her readers as well as write truly beautiful, lyrical prose that is deeply moving. Similar to Their Eyes Were Watching God (Hurston), I tried reading this a few years ago and found myself intimidated--though, now having read it, I can't quite figure out why that is. Having said that, I'm glad I waited as I feel I read this book at the right time and it struck every right chord with me. In my opinion, Morrison's debut is a perfect novel that is so heavily layered and unique I feel I will be returning to it again and again.Show more"

This is still a sad reality for many black kids because society, and sometimes our environment, instills anti blackness into us. Morrison even highlights how this can cause the black community to tear each other down (little black boys teasing Pecola for being black, mixed people disowning their black identity).Trigger warning for those who haven’t read it. There is mention of rape, incest, and pedophilia. This made it difficult for me to continue reading which is why I knocked off a star. However, the rape does tie into Pecola’s story and further displays how black girls are treated and viewed in society. Overall, a great read to invoke thought. Show more"

It focuses on her friend Pecola, who is a victim of abuse and becomes pregnant. The tale moves backward into the origins of her parents in the South, rendering an intergenerational perspective on the sources of internalized racism. Almost as a parable, Pecola dreams all can change if she could only have blue eyes. Throughout the narrative, Claudia's vibrant vision on the joys of life found between the cracks of a hardscrabble existence becomes shadowed by her revelations on the dark fate of those around her.

(Reading it and knowing I was going to see it as a play, I kept wondering how the adaptation would work because the structure here is so specific and so much of the book's power comes from that and from the narrative voice.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3743145-kelly,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 20, 2020",4 likes,0,"Toni Morrison is one of the authors whose work continues to grow and speak in the reader's mind long after the book itself is finished. I sat and thought for quite a while after finishing this one. As I was reading the book, I didn't like it very much. I admired Morrison's writing, as always, but the story itself was difficult for both the way it is told, portioned out into different sections narrated by different people, and for the subject matter, which, in the eye of Morrison's hurricane of poverty and hardship, tells the rape and subsequent pregnancy of an eleven-year-old girl named Pecola by her father.As always with Toni Morrison, there is the imagery, the allegory, and the symbolism to dissect. - The bluest eye. Little Pecola, after being so thoroughly abused and disposed of, goes to the town fortune teller to beg for blue eyes. The new eyes will allow her to be seen by others differently, and will allow her to see herself differently. It is not only how she wants to be perceived by others - as beautiful - but also the fact that she cannot look at this thing that happened to her, cannot look at it in the eye, so needs different eyes, to see different things - beautiful things - that her black eyes in her black face in her black body and with her black soul cannot ever know.- There is so much nature creeping into this story. The cold wind blows through the cracks of the window when our main narrator, little Claudia, is sick in bed. The marigolds refuse to grow, the seeds not sprouting into buds - a winter when so much goes wrong, when childhood is stunted, when a little girl stops growing. The book is even divided into seasonal sections. This invasion of nature, this penetration by nature into the human experiences in this book, and as explicit as the physical penetration of human nature into these girls' bodies and experiences, is perpetuated throughout the book. There is something perverse and destructive about this nature, something twisted, and it is inside of all of these adults and it is creeping into all of these naive little girls' lives.Morrison writes right up to the edge of things and she dares to push over the edge, too. She could have written that Pecola's father, Cholly Breedlove, impregnated his daughter. But she didn't stop there. She wrote out the scene, she made us witness it, she painted it in detail, from his perspective, no less, and she didn't beautify it. She laid it bare in all of its disgrace. There are so many scenes of hardship, so many injustices and wrongs and hurts woven by different voices throughout this book. And then we watch as it pours over into the next generation, as the wounds of the parents bleed onto the children, and the parents open up huge gashes in their children's psyches and in their flesh, and the children are forever changed, the course of their lives veer inexorably into a different future, somewhere over the edge, beyond the picket fences and the neat homes and the blond baby dolls, into the abyss, where real things hide and fester, waiting to eat them alive.If you lived in Lorrain, Ohio, in 1941, in an old furniture shop turned house, with the town whores in the apartment upstairs, and you knew you were ugly and you were worthless even to your own family, and the kids at school tormented you, and your daddy came home when you were eleven years old and washing the dishes and raped you, and then did it again, well - wouldn't you want the bluest eyes, too?Show more"

Mi problema con este libro no son exactamente las escenas horribles y deleznables que están incluidas, ya que que un autor escriba sobre ciertos temas no significa ni que lo esté apoyando o justificando ni que la voz narrativa sea la suya propia (al igual que cuando un autor escribe sobre asesinos en serie nadie puede pensar que al autor le parezcan bien esos temas), sino que para mí no tienen la profundidad suficiente para justificar su inclusión. ¿Por qué Cholly recurre a cometer crímenes sexuales? No lo sabemos. Ninguna descripción de su infancia indica que pueda comportarse así en el futuro, él no ve esos comportamientos en su entorno y no sabemos de dónde los aprende. Este libro intenta demasiado usar eventos traumáticos en la vida de sus personajes (especialmente de Pecola) sin ofrecer ningún tipo de sustancia y tiende a confundir el impacto emocional que ocasiona con que esa escena ""sea buena"". No sé. He leído libros (como My Dark Vanessa) en los que el abuso sexual a la protagonista es una parte fundamental de la historia, y su inclusión, aunque igualmente asquerosa, avanza la narrativa y es necesaria para entender al personaje, sus sentimientos y comportamientos con su alrededor y consigo misma. ¿Qué ofrece a la narrativa mencionar en extremo detalle los abusos de Soaphead a niñas? Nada, porque no son importantes. Esto sólo provoca una respuesta emocional y desagradable y no creo que su mención sea necesaria en absoluto porque se tratan como simples escenas sorprendentes y ya.Aún así diría que hay partes de la historia que sí que merecen la pena y la forma de Toni Morrison de ejemplificar el odio propio y el racismo interiorizado de la mayor parte de los personajes me ha gustado bastante, y sí que se siente genuina y auténtica.Entiendo completamente a la gente que no pudo disfrutar nada del libro, porque las escenas desagradables son MUY desagradables, aunque me sigue pareciendo un error confundir las justificaciones de la voz narrativa con la propia voz de Morrison. Definitivamente, creo que si hubiese sentido que semejantes escenas tenían sentido para la historia no me habría disgustado tanto, pero sigo sintiendo que lo único que quería Morrison era sorprendernos y horrorizarnos pero sin darle mayor trasfondo a los hechos, y eso le quita verosimilitud a la historia y le resta un impacto dramático que debería estar ahí.Show more"

Kısrak canının yandığını söyleyemiyor diye, canı yanmıyor mu sanıyor bunlar?""4/5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Toni Morrison'dan daha önce Sevilen kitabını okumak için elime almıştım ama bir şekilde başında bırakıp rafa kaldırmıştım. Yazardan henüz bir kitap okumamış olmanın verdiği vicdan azabına son vererek büyük bir merakla En Mavi Göz kitabına başladım. Açıkçası yazarı kafamda bir erkek yazar olarak tavsip ettiğim için belirli bir yere kadar o bakış açısıyla okudum. Kadın bir yazar olduğunu öğrendikten sonra da bir bakımdan yazdıklarını sindirmem daha zor oldu. Kaleme alınması çok zor konulara tereddütsüz bir şekilde değinmesi hem tebrik etmemi hem de ürkerek okumamı sağladı. Pedofili, ensest tarzı durumlara her kitapta tanık olmadığım için ve yazarın bu vakaları detaylı bir şekilde yazması beni çok etkiledi. Yazarın güzellik kavramına değinmesi çok acı bir şekilde harikaydı. Zenci ve siyahi arasındaki farkı, bir melezle siyahi arasındaki farkı gerçekten acı verici bir şekilde doğru ifade etmişti. Kitabın içeriğinde birkaç aile hikayesine değiniliyor olsa da ortak noktada iki aileyi birleştiren ana karakterimiz Pecola oluyor. Kendi yaşadığım çocukluğun güzelliğiyle, anılarını hatırlayarak mutlu olan biri olarak dünyanın bambaşka uçlarında gerçekten böyle hayatlar yaşanması empati duygumu zirvelere çıkardı. Pecola'yı okudukça daha da mahvoldum, yazarın gerçekçi dili hem tokat gibi çarparken hem de bu kadar gerçekçi bir anlatımla yüz yüze olmanın verdiği rahatsızlıkla okuyucuyu kendisiyle tartıyor. Yazarın bu kitaptaki kalemini şokla okuyarak diğer kitaplarının içeriğini çok merak ettim. Sevilen adlı kitabı muhtemelen ikinci kitabım olacak, ayrıca yazarın hayatını da detaylı bir şekilde okumak istiyorum.

I read it 10 years ago, as part of the syllabus of an overly ambitious 8th grade English teacher. Back then, I did not have the tools to understand what a masterpiece this was. I did not have the critical mindset nor the maturity to dwell on the details, the writing style, the narrative. When I picked it up for a reread the day of Morrison’s departure from this world, I had entirely forgotten what it even was about.But I hadn’t forgotten how I FELT when I read this. Picture this: a 13 year old girl with small, dark eyes, thinking that if they were wider and bluer she would be prettier. That girls and boys would like her more. Begging her mother to let her have those contacts that changed your eye color. Staring in the mirror imagining how things would be different. If only her eyes were blue. Now imagine this: that same 13 year old girl reading a book that showed just how cruel this desire was. A teacher in a classroom discussing how destructive and harmful the standard of whiteness was.Morrison did not write this book, or any of her books, for people like me — I was and am a guest with the privilege of reading her work. Yet she made an impact to little girls everywhere, her reach extending to everyone who ever thought that whiter was prettier.13 year old me gives this 5 stars but 23 year old me gives this a very strong 4 star rating. While still powerful, it wasn’t as moving as it had initially been, the nonlinear style was a bit hard to follow, and I wished the character of Pecola given more of a voice. Nonetheless, a great place to start for anyone who wants to experience Morrison for the first time.Show more"

The language is lyrical and the narrative is broken up in a way that you should not rush the reading of this raw and beautifully sad story.The summery of this book is weak compared to the actual impact while reading it. It’s about a girl who wants blue eyes, so she can be beautiful. This story doesn’t have a solid plot to move this story forward, other than the breaking down of such an innocent child. The narrative follows many people in this short 200 page book but never at the sacrifice of each ones personality. They all feel like individuals and all real. At the core of every narrative is the breaking of this little girl.I’m going to quote the author’s notes a bit here… This book started out as a character study of “Racial Self Loathing”. The why and the how of it. But soon turned into how “grotesque demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society, a child. The most vulnerable member, a female.” She doesn’t dehumanize the wrong doers, she instead writes them in a way so the reader isn’t “pitying the child for the smashing, but is forced to interrogate themselves for the smashing.” The author claims she isn’t satisfied that her message has come across… So I believe it’s up to the reader to go into this book aware of that message. Which is why I felt it was important to insert it in this review.This book should be read by everyone, period. I’m only giving this 4 stars because it is a more difficult book to piece together.

Some instances were immensely gripping and heartbreaking, especially when it comes to the accounts of things that happen to the young and innocent Pecola. Her wish to have blue eyes is very childlike but also points to the toxicity of racism and unrealistic beauty standards.However, the whole story felt a bit disjointed. It went back and forth in timelines and chapters sometimes started with very cryptic, prose-like descriptions of a scene that was not really introduced to the extent that I could grasp the significance of it easily. Perhaps that was the point and perhaps Morrison was aiming more for the feeling instead of the understanding. If that is the case, this might not be for me.

Her intelligence and deep understanding of human nature translates so beautifully in her work. This book is exquisitely written. The characterization is impeccable. The characters who do unspeakably horrible things are not dehumanized, yet not romanticized either. The way Morrison frames the narrative and develops the characters; shrewdly shifting from first-person to third-person, depending on how active or passive the character whose perspective we are in left me completely astounded by her talent. Furthermore, the emphasis she puts on the toxicity of beauty standards and society's continued insistence to value physical beauty above all else—and the anger that stems and grows and festers in young people when they are unable to meet those standards—is thought-provoking, to say the least. It is glaring in a manner that gives you no choice but to confront it. I will say, though, that as I was approaching the midpoint of the book, I started to get worried about all the perspectives getting too convoluted to follow but the different threads of the story ended up gracefully connecting and were seamlessly tied together by the end. The Bluest Eye, at its core, is a nuanced examination of the extent of internalized racism and the potential, or rather inevitable, violent repercussions of it. And I highly recommend it.Show more"

The prose is dense with imagery and feeling but never shoehorned or forced. Everything is charged and powerful but also mundane and very sad. A very sad book but Morrison's project is clear and so is her vision. There is a powerful lack of ambiguity in her writing. Follows the lives of a black community in Ohio, centring on one family and the 12 year old daughter, Pecola. Often told through the eyes of two sisters around Pecola's age, who witness her and the events of the novel with the powerful honesty and open-minded dignity that young people / children offer the world. They watch the violence of racism play out in their communities and families. Even the characters who commit acts of violence are placed in their context - not redeemed but contextualised, and that feels very important. Racism is poisonous. Would advise people who are interested in reading to check out the content warnings cause it is heavy.ALSO: just remembered. I knew Morrison was a celebrated writer, but I didn't know she was so formally experimental and lit in that way. I absolutely adore how she writes and structures the story.

Morrison has brutiful (brutal/beautiful) powerful prose, and I can appreciate why she is recognized as one of the greatest writers of her time. I had, I believe as she intended, visceral reactions to the subject matter of this novel. I had to skim parts to avoid physical illness. It helped (slightly) to have the flashbacks of Pecola's parents lives, but I was still left bereft at the damage perpetuated by our nation built on racism. I personally am better able to appreciate and digest nonfiction books on this subject, but I recognize the power of this fictional narrative. After all, so many of the primary source voices who could provide us information on what it was like to be black and poor in America during the 1940s were kept silent and illiterate by the system that oppressed them. Thus I see the need for fictional depictions to help us imagine and in some tiny way understand what our country did to black and brown people.

Societal racism is bad enough, but to read the darkest thoughts of a young girl who actually believes she is ugly and inferior because of what white beauty standards have taught her is absolutely heartbreaking. I haven't seen an author write this well about race before.This is not a pleasant read and I doubt it's intended to be. I learned a lot about a new perspective - Pecola Breedlove, the young Black girl who experiences some of the most awful things in life (rape/subsequent pregnancy, abuse, bullying, lack of love). The lengths that Toni Morrison takes to explain the contexts and backstories for all the awful things that occur surprised me - it's deeply disturbing since it humanizes and almost condones these actions. But, she does it to educate the reader about the motivations for why people do bad things, or how the environments they were placed in, cultivate horrible behavior. Tying it back to their upbringing, emotional abuse, and personal traumas. ~Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty.

In her intro, Morrison recognizes that culture begets language and that she must use the English language, as problematic as it is, in order to tell a story that is not congruent for the attitude, audience, or society at the time. I was struck by her use of nature as well- the girls as flowers unable to grow in “bad soil,” the coming and going of seasons and its parallel to character growth, and the way any seed of hope is thoroughly stomped out. The way in which Morrison displayed the naïveté of individuals, two little girls who attempted to wish and pray for Pecola, fighting against a system that’s set up against them from birth, utterly broke me. 4.5 stars (lacks an abundance of dream sequences present in her subsequent novels). “Love is never any better than the lover…there is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover’s inward eye.” “Our limitations were not known to us- not then.” “And the difference was all the difference there was.”“But to find out the truth about how dreams die, one should never take the word of a dreamer.”Show more"

The unending cruelty of her world, the loss of innocence, the self-hatred and feeling of ""ugliness"" put on her by an upbringing in a depressed home and town, in a family that is the product of generational trauma where there was no love or hope for this child...all felt very real and authentic. I didn't feel like I was being taken for a ride or manipulated, rather, this frank and beautifully written (and often disturbing) portrayal of a child's life is a powerful commentary on race and poverty, how children are failed by parents and communities that were also failed by a society lacking in compassion and humanity.Show more"

Toni Morrison explores the complexity of race, socioeconomic status, and gender with grace in this book. Her writing is raw, and oftentimes shockingly frank.

While I wish I liked this more, and wanted to like this more, I found that the book was extremely scattered and depressing. There’s so much sexual violence, domestic abuse, poverty, and racism spreed throughout each of the pages that it made it hard to want to read. Pecola from birth was set up to fail from all the adults that were supposed to protect her. I’m happy I read it and finally finished but wow was that a tough read. Show more"

She has been “accused” of laying language bare, causing her readers to face their individual stance on rape, love, racism, monstrous otherness, and so on. Morrison loves language and that is obvious in this book just as it was in every other one of her other works. The way she builds on this love, however, is challenging. One cannot simply put the book down and start doing the dishes. Too many attempts to define the world are left behind for the reader and, according to the author’s Introduction and Afterword, for Morrison herself. Show more"

This book on an emotional level hurt my stomach, made me feel warmth, and brought me to tears. In the introduction she writes, ""one problem was the weight of the novel's inquiry on so delicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing."" This book shows a full portrayal of the harms of antiblackness in beauty standards. It shows the insidious ways these ideals are crammed down our throats from the literal minute we enter this world and the vast array of ways it continues to be present in our everyday lives (and our complicity in this system to not stop it from entering into our lives!!). As Toni Morrison says, there is a deep desire to just feel anger at Pecola's situation and it's so tempting to just say w0w, I can't believe people are evil. She doesn't let it be that simple though! She takes the evil characters and gives them back stories and personalities and makes them real. She never justifies their actions but that added detail adds a rich layer and shows how there can be so much hurt in this world. Additionally, Toni Morrison crafts the story in such a way that as the reader you do question what is my role in this? How did I negatively contribute to Pecola's life and actively harm her? Ugh, truly fantastic - can't wait to read people's analyses of this book! If you have any....hit me up!Another reason it is a 5 star: Toni Morrison wrote a paragraph on tooth decay that was so phenomenal I just sat there for a while...and yeah idk just wow an author who can do that....a true great!Show more"

The closing paragraph stays with me and is representative of Morrison’s poetic and thought-provoking writing throughout: “I talk about how I did not plant the seeds too deeply, how it was the fault of the earth, the land, of our town. I even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year. This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live. We are wrong, of course, but it doesn’t matter. It’s too late.”Show more"

But, in some ways, it was too late (as Claudia's last lines claim). I had already read the Soaphead Church section. There are disturbing and ugly aspects of life that deserve to be revealed for what they are. There are aspects of life that seem disturbing and ugly that deserve to be exonerated for not being what people think they are. There are people who deserve a voice, people that are crippled, deaf, lame, of the sexual minority, of the racial and ethnic minority, people who can't speak for themselves, people whom others think are ugly or dumb but are really beautiful and intelligent in unique ways. Pecola is one these people; a child molester never will be. I don't want a child molester to be justified; I don't want to hear his voice. I don't want to know why he does it. I don't want to know how he feels about it. I don't care what his backstory is (and I'm using the masculine pronoun because I'm talking about this male character). It will never be justified. It will never be acceptable. Morrison groups Soaphead's sexual release with homosexuality and bestiality. How are those the same as molesting a child? She calls it a ""flaw,"" but then she calls it ""innocent"" and ""clean."" I can't get past that. I wanted to give this book four stars until I read that section.I say it's too late because Morrison wanted us to interrogate ourselves for the ""smashing"" of Pecola. Why am I interrogating myself? Where is my culpability in the ""smashing"" of Pecola? I don't want literature to condemn me; I want it to enlighten me. My author shouldn't expect me to feel guilty. If she wants her reader to embrace self-reflection, she can use her characters and her narrative voice to ease me into it, not to coerce or manipulate me into it. I've read many books about difficult topics, but there is a method of internalization that allows the reader to see and understand without forcing her to feel bad about her watchful gaze. If white people saw black people at a distance and overlooked them or refused to understand them, write to allow them to see truly and without prejudice. Don't write to force all readers, current and future, to feel responsible for the ""grotesque...demonization of an entire race."" I wanted to write about this book in a literary way, to discuss the use of sections from a ""Dick and Jane"" primer as headers for all the chapters, to reflect on the title and its implications throughout the text, to talk about beauty and why black people didn't and don't feel beautiful if their beauty isn't standardized, to examine the narrative structure, and to fully appreciate all that Morrison accomplished in her novel. To discuss Frieda and Claudia, Pecola, the setting, the symbols...but I honestly feel like I can't. I can't rate it or recommend it. It was a book that I almost loved and would have given four stars to and would have highly recommended if it weren't for the Soaphead section and the ""Afterword.""This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

Not because she was absurd, or repulsive, or because we were frightened, but because we had failed her.” What a devastating book. This hurt my heart. As a wahine, I’ve always been intimately familiar with the ways that beauty standards can be internalised and effect our insides - to such an extent that it can bleed into the outside. But I’d never been forced to reflect on how westernised standards - the direct correlation between whiteness and beauty itself - could effect a child of colour. This was pretty hard. This book was difficult for me: it forced me to confront a lot of my own internalised understandings of beauty. Why do I find certain things attractive and others not? Why are some things beautiful and others fetishised? Can I rewire my brain to think otherwise? One element of this book I found particularly compelling was Morrison’s foreword and afterword - where she touches on her attempts to write a narrative that doesn’t evoke pity, but instead asks readers to confront their own internalised white supremacy. In my case, she was successful. A difficult and harrowing read, that was also astoundingly beautiful. 4/5Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65555549-hannah-----on-hiatus,The Bluest Eye,Rating 5 out of 5,"June 27, 2018",4 likes,0,"In a racially divided town still suffering from the ravages of the Great Depression, Pecola Breedlove is born.Ugly. Dirty. Weak. Worthless. That is what society tells her, and so that is what she believes.She is beaten down, over and over and over again, until she finally realizes what she has been craving all along: love and acceptance. Love and acceptance, in the form of two beautiful, blue-sky eyes.
Then Pecola asked a question that had never entered my mind. “How do you do that? I mean, how do you get somebody to love you?” But Frieda was asleep. And I didn’t know.
The Bluest Eye stands out with its unique structure, as it is divided up into four parts, each representing the seasons of the year. My heart continuously broke as I watched Pecola- such a lovely, pure spirit- learn to hate her own skin, hate herself. I think a lot of us can empathize with her desire to become someone else, someone we feel is ""prettier"" and ""better"". But while their society's idolizing of white purity moves characters like Claudia to anger, Pecola’s innocence makes her even more vulnerable to the crushing weight of others’ expectations.
The novel tried to hit the raw nerve of racial self-contempt, expose it, then soothe it not with narcotics but with language that replicated the agency I discovered in my first experience of beauty.
Intricate, almost ""sensory"" writing like Morrison's is usually a hit-or-miss for me. But in this case, each sentence plucked at my heartstrings and haunted me long after I closed the book.Morrison doesn't sugarcoat her descriptions, to the point where reading particular scenes became disturbing. But the writing style is meant to provoke certain visceral emotions; it is meant to make readers uncomfortable, and in doing so, force them to confront real societal issues. Her provocative words contain a raw and terrible beauty that perfectly captures Pecola's gradual diminishing of mind, spirit, and heart.
Adults, older girls, shops, magazines, newspapers, window signs—all the world had agreed that a blue-eyed, yellow-haired, pink-skinned doll was what every girl child treasured. “Here,” they said, “this is beautiful, and if you are on this day ‘worthy’ you may have it.” 
Some may view Morrison's message as overly preachy, but I think that the enormous loss and heartbreak she portrays serves an Important narrative purpose. Through the characters' trials, Toni Morrison reflects the harsh realities of our society’s impossibly rigid notions of race and beauty. In a materialistic society that puts enormous weight behind appearances, a child’s need to conform destroys their sense of self-worth and identity.Essentially, this is a book about Pecola's unraveling. It ends on a bittersweet note that is at once entirely hopeless and oddly hopeful. Despite everything that has been done, Morrison reminds us that maybe, one day, marigolds will finally be able to grow on our soil.
And the lives of these old black women were synthesized in their eyes- a puree of tragedy and humor, wickedness and serenity, truth and fantasy.

I had a plan and a worksheet and the class had five or six options. I used The Bluest Eye as a model, and I read the first pages aloud. We spent an entire period individually examining the options, which included very short and also longer books, and discussing them in small groups and then as a class. Four students wanted to read Morrison's novel and convinced the rest of the class, but I didn't have a classroom set. ""We can't read this one,"" I said. But they voted for it anyway. ""Can't you photocopy it for us?"" So I did. This was the old pre-Nobel version of Morrison's first novel and only 160 pages. I managed to get the entire novel on 20 sheets of blue legal-sized paper. Several students went out and bought it for themselves almost immediately. It should be noted that this was not one of my Honors classes, but students in a ""Regular"" English class.The next textbook adoption year I proposed it and the Board accepted it and for the next 20 years it was the most horrifying and beloved novel I taught. I always did an activity based on the first pages beginning:  Nuns go by as quiet as lust, and drunken men and sober eyes sing in the lobby of the Greek hotel. Rosemary Villanucci, our next-door friend who lives above her father's cafe, sits in a 1939 Buick eating bread and butter. She rolls down the window to tell my sister Frieda and me that we can't come in. We stare at her, wanting her bread, but more than that wanting to poke the arrogance out of her eyes and smash the pride of ownership that curls her chewing mouth. It ends with: ""So when I think of autumn, I think of somebody with hands who does not want me to die."" We talked about that and the humor, the Maginot Line, and the naiveté of children.I always told them they were free to skip pages that troubled them. I told them why. I reassured them we would not dwell on those pages and, ""You know what is happening and you do not need to read it."" I discovered early on that I needed to review how Pecola and the narrator, Claudia, came from similar households in terms of demographics—one working parent, poverty, racism beating them down. One household was based on love, the other on pain and resentment. Corporal punishment in one household, abuse in the other.In the early years, my school was almost entirely white, but in the later years I had POC in my class. Race is a central issue, but what Morrison's first novel really concerns is love, beginning with self-love. It was the novel students were most likely to come back after graduation and thank me for assigning. Often they did this immediately after they read it.I own several copies. This is one of only two books I keep in multiples now that I am retired.......Show more"

I'm hard pressed to think of a better debut novel. Certainly, there's ""Go Tell It On the Mountain,"" too, but there's no sag in the middle with this one. All of the diversions backward, the camera-eye looks into peripheral figures and family histories, gallop along with sore desperation and near-cosmic precision. It shifts perspectives effortlessly, flips back and forth between omniscient narrator and interior monologue, all in the service of total clarity. The main story concerns Pecola, a 12-year old girl in a truly dead-end family. She wishes for blue eyes, just like Shirley Temple, her beloved role model. She wants to be beautiful. She is not considered beautiful. Even among the black people in her town, lighter-skinned black people look down on their darker-skinned brethren. This alone would be a compelling topic for a book, but Morrison goes so much further. She teases out the complexity of friendship, camaraderie among outcasts, alcoholism, pity, rape, superstition, asexuality with pedophilic tendencies, power dynamics in marriage, and so, so, so much more. It shies away from nothing, and it excuses nothing, but it does find the humanity behind every bad deed. It's one of those books that will be despised by people who use words like ""moral relativism"" as a hurled epithet. It dares to see the inner life of a father that's raped his daughter, an old man that's exposed himself to children, a child that's killed his family cat to spite his mother, and dares us to admit that even if we despise everything that's happened, we owe it to ourselves to understand the whys and hows. Just after I finished this book, I thumbed through John Leonard's ""Reading For My Life,"" and I found this line that I underlined furiously a few years ago: ""books are where we go alone to complicate ourselves."" Also, Pecola's mistreatment by people who feel sorry for her mirrored a sentiment I read a few weeks prior in Renata Adler's ""Speedboat"": ""It is not at all uncommon for someone to arrive at the scene of a brutality or injustice and, with a sympathetic murmur or heroic flourish, attack the victim. It happens all the time."" This is the territory in which this book exists.This is a hard book, and you'll want to look away, but don't. Morrison is such a capable guide. She never forces you to stare at horror just for revulsion's sake. She interlocks all of these stories, these testimonies of lives ruined by centuries of institutional racism and imagine things being better much later. For the people in this story, it will always be too late. And for many, it may be too late for some time to come. ""The Bluest Eye"" asks us to work and to fight so that someday, maybe after we are long dead and gone, it might not be too late.Show more"

The searing pain Morrison communicated was baffling to me; her poetry impenetrable. Rereading it for the first time some thirty years later, I find it no less painful; so much ugliness and anger, degradation and self-hatred. It may be more difficult to read because there is now also, a recognition of its authenticity. I have known these people.  When Sammy and Pecola were still young Pauline had to go back to work. She was older now, with no time for dreams and movies. It was time to pull all of the pieces together, make coherence where before there had been none. The children gave her this need; she herself was no longer a child. So she became, and her process of becoming was like most of ours: she developed a hatred for things that mystified or obstructed her; acquired virtues that were easy to maintain; assigned herself a role in the scheme of things; and harked back to simpler times for gratification.She took on the full responsibility and recognition of breadwinner and returned to church. First, however, she moved out of the two rooms into a spacious first floor of a building that had been built as a store. She came into her own with the women who had despised her, by being more moral than they: she avenged herself on Cholly by forcing him to indulge in the weaknesses she despised. She joined a church where shouting was frowned upon, served on Stewardess Board No. 3, and became a member of Ladies Circle No. 1. At prayer meeting, she moaned and sighed over Cholly's ways, and hoped God would help her keep the children from the sins of the father. She stopped saying 'chil'ren' and said 'childring' instead. She let another tooth fall, and was outraged by painted ladies who thought only of clothes and men. Holding Cholly as a model of sin and failure, she bore him like a crown of thorns, and her children like a cross.It is clear that Morrison knows people (her own American people, intimately) and US social history and I think her grasp of personality development and the childhood perspective, the child's interpretation of adult words and adult behaviour is spot on. I think this was one of her earlier books and it is somewhat raw, but no less powerful for that. So, this is a difficult read, but I shall finish it this time, absorbing the medicine in small doses to the end of the course. Show more"

If you'd rather avoid devastating stories that will tear at your heart, this book may not be for you. Morrison is one of our best authors, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature, so, at the least, you might not want to dismiss her out of hand.My suggestion is to read the two brief prologues before you decide whether this is a path you want to walk. The second prologue, in particular, will alert you to the type of content you will be dealing with. Read the second sentence of the second prologue and see if this is where you want to spend however many hours it will take you to read this book.The book was published in 1970, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights movement, and continues to be a relevant story today in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. It is the tragic story of a little black girl, Pecola, who prays that God will give her blue eyes so that everyone will think she is pretty like the blue-eyed little white girls. The narrator is a black woman who was also a child at the time the story takes place, and whose family had taken in Pecola for a time when her family's home was set on fire. The question of racial self-loathing is a guiding theme in the story as the narrator flips back through time exploring the lives of the main characters in order to give us some kind of understanding of maybe not why, but how, such self-loathing can happen.Morrison's first novel is an example of an author finally able to shape into an outward form some great interior torment. A kind of catharsis, or like Hemingway said, and I'm paraphrasing, writing is sitting at the typewriter and bleeding.Morrison chose the most vulnerable member of society, a black female child, to dramatize the plight of blacks in this country heading into the 1940s. What makes this such a powerful and universal book, for me at least, is that The Bluest Eye dramatizes not only the devastating impact of racial injustice on black persons, but the tragedy of human indifference and cruelty that shackles too many of us and keeps us from recognizing the human dignity of each and every person.Show more"

Her first novel, the book came out in 1970, and somehow I missed it. I'm sorry I did, as it would have given me a proper introduction to Morrison's amazing work.The story revolves around an African American community, a neighborhood in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, where the women are poor and often treated brutally by their men. One of the children, Pecola, is growing up in a bad household, her mother neglectful, her father abusive and predatory. Feeling herself to be ugly, she comes to desire nothing more than to have blue eyes, an impossibility that nobody bothers to explain to her, in order to be loved.""Here was an ugly little girl asking for beauty. . . A little black girl who wanted to rise up out of the pit of her blackness and see the world with blue eyes.""Adults in Pecola's world, and that of her friends Claudia and Frieda, rarely give guidance to the girls about how their lives might unfold. They expect rather that a little girl will automatically adopt the reality that black females are the lowest of the low, victims of both racism and sexism, and come to accept it. In this respect the story is a tragedy. Many black women in 1941 saw no way forward to a better life. And when the book was written in 1970, conditions for them were probably no better.The latter half of the novel is a series of flashbacks to the painful upbringings of some the adults in the story. They seem to offer an explanation and/or justification for their abusive behavior, particularly the men's, toward their wives (beatings), daughters (rape), and little girls in general (cruel deception). With these flashbacks Morrison is expressing her belief that people are not born evil; it is their circumstances that make them so.The Bluest Eye portrays black women as denied and devalued, even by members of their own race. Pecola's little friend Claudia, the sometimes-narrator of the story, is the only character who rejects the notion that white people are more lovely or lovable than black ones, and this character injects glimpses of hope for coming generations of black females. With this novel Morrison presents a powerful portrait of resilience and incipient power. The Bluest Eye is a beautifully written landmark book.Show more"

This novel is set in 1940s Ohio and is the story of Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl, who prays every day to be beautiful. She is not at all what the other kids think of as beautiful in 1940s Ohio, mainly because she has dark skin, curly hair, and brown eyes that set her apart, and to be different is to be mocked. She wants to fit in with everybody else and hopes she can do this by having blond hair and blue eyes. Of course, this wish is juxtaposed by the incredibly horrible things that are happening to her at home. Like all Morrison novels, terribly disturbing and heartbreaking this happen, including incest, alcoholism, insanity, child abuse, etc. all set against the backdrop of racism. Obviously, Pecola’s desire to have blue eyes and blond hair is symbolic and is about as subtle as a frying pan to the head.Terribly heartbreaking story, mixed with the usual heartbreakingly incredible writing style of Toni Morrison. One of the more difficult authors I have ever encountered. I initially thought this book might be the most accessible Morrison I have read, but it quickly became the usual Morrison fare with its shifts in perspective and non-linear sequence.I do “get” Morrison and her brilliance and I think she is truly one of the finest authors ever to walk the Earth, but I will admit that I struggle with her books and how they should be rated. There is great value is experiencing the brilliance of her ability and I am not sure if anyone’s books have ever stayed with me more than hers, but usually when I put them down, I am not really terribly excited about picking up another one to read. (Indeed, I had to read a light non-fiction book about college basketball after finishing this one.) I find it this emotionally draining to read her stuff; I can only imagine what it is like to for her to write these works. While it is a great experience to have to read this book, it really is not an experience that I want to try to replicate and I don’t think that is necessarily a compliment.Show more"

Küçük siyah bir kızın, “güzel” ve “beyaz aileler” gibi olabilmek için istediği “en mavi” gözlerin hikayesi. Bu durum bana ABD’de yapılan bir araştırmayı hatırlattı. Küçük çocuklara, bir beyaz ve bir siyah bebek gösteriliyor ve “en güzel” bebeği seçmeleri bekleniyor. En Mavi Göz, 1968 yılında yazılsa da, bu güncel çalışmadan da aynı sonuç çıkıyor. Çocukların hepsi, kendileri siyah bile olsa, beyaz bebeklerin daha güzel olduğunu düşünüyorlar.Bu kitap, aile içi şiddet ve tecavüzü de barındırıyor.

Kitabın anlatıcıları arasındaki diğer küçük kızlar, bu yorumlar arasında kaygı ve keder de arıyor ama bulamıyor. Tıpkı bizim ülkemizde de “dişi köpeğin her zaman kuyruk salladığına” inanılması gibi. İlginç olan şeylerden biri kitapta en beğendiğim noktalardan birinin bir başka pedofilin “Tanrı’ya” yazdığı mektup olması. Pedofil, falcı olarak geçinen ve küçük kız çocuklarına düşkün bir herif tam anlamıyla ve şöyle diyor: “Söyle bana Tanrım, bir kızcağızı o kadar uzun zaman, o kadar yalnız nasıl bırakabildin de, o kız bana kadar gelebildi?

Ne var ki, beni rahatsız etmek yerine, kalbimi kırdı. Evet, bu kitap kalbimi çok kırdı. Yazar, kitabın sonundaki notunda diyor ki: “Romanın sorguladığı meselelerin ağırlığı böylesine narin ve savunmasız bir karaktere yüklemek, bu karakterin ezilmesine yol açabilir, okuru da bu ezilmede kendisinin nasıl bir payı olduğunu sorgulamaya sevk etmekten ziyade, karaktere acımanın konforuna sürükleyebilirdi.

I have been a reader all my life and took so many lit classes in college and somehow I have never had the opportunity to read this book until now.This book begins in 1941 and is the story of Pecola. However, the book changes points-of-view throughout the story. One of the points-of-view is Claudia, the daughter of Pecola’s foster parents. Pecola is placed in foster care after her father burns down their house. Pecola’s circumstances have made her believe that she is ugly and she desires blue eyes. With blue eyes, she will beautiful like the other white girls in her city.This is a relatively short novel, at only 200 pages but it makes its point. This book discusses race, internalized racism, abuse, class, family, and innocence. This novel is tragic. This book shows just how awful and cruel racism is. Pecola is ashamed of her skin and her looks because society tells her that the most beautiful girls have blonde hair and blue eyes. This has an impact on how she views herself and more importantly her worth. This book was published in 1970 and our society still portrays beauty in that way. We need to do better as a society so every girl feels beautiful, comfortable, and worthy in her own skin.There is also the themes of sexual assault. The sexual abuse that Pecola endures is extremely difficult to read. The hurt and pain, along with the shame and loss of innocence is described extremely well.The points-of-view changes did through me off a few times, but they are a necessary part of the story. This isn’t a “light” read. It will weigh heavily on your heart, but you need to pay attention and learn. The prose is outstanding. I can honestly say I have never read anything like it. It flows perfectly. I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend this read and will be purchasing more Toni Morrison books in the future.Show more"

The book is told from multiple perspectives and times, stitching together a quilt of views of the girl, a lost soul who becomes a troubled soul, and the various points of view make it all seem inevitable. Everyone is the way they are, and the way they are leads to one little girl, the least among us, never having anything and losing everything. For this girl there is no community, for the black community is complicit in the crimes against her. Blacks compete with blacks, judge each other, look down on each other; it seems there's more friction than comfort. But then Morrison looks at those complicit, looks at the societal pressures that shaped their lives, the humiliations, shame, anger. She looks at their perspectives, how they too were powerless when confronted with greater forces. Even the little girl's mother prefers the white family she works for, to her own family and children. Then outside that circle of guilt, there's yet another larger circle of hell, of failure. The Bluest Eye says at some point we all have responsibility for what happens in our society, and a responsibility to act. As this was Toni Morrison's first novel she had not acquired the skills that became obvious later, she wasn't quite yet Toni Morrison. Here she's a little clumsier, a little more obvious, maybe a little harsher than she needs to be. But while noticeable, none of that detracts from the powerful story, the important philosophy, and the strong emotions the reader feels. The Bluest Eye is a necessary book for anyone who wants to read great American authors. [4★]Show more"

This is the third Toni Morrison I've read and easily my favorite so far. This novel is about a young girl who desperately wants blue eyes. It examines beauty ideals which are perpetuated through adulthood and rooted in white supremacy. There are scenes in this book that are awful, but written in ways that allow the reader to recognize the talent required to illustrate horrific things brilliantly. Morrison inserts seemingly minute details into scenes that stuck with me for the entire book (ex. the main character scratching the back of her calf with her toe and her rapist is disgusted with the act of the scratching). The Bluest Eye knocked me out and left me with my jaw on the ground.It was their contempt for their own blackness that gave the first insult its teeth. they seemed to have taken all of their smoothly cultivated ignorance, their exquisitely learned self-hatred, their elaborately designed hopelessness and sucked it all up into a fiery cone of scorn that had burned for ages in the hollows of their minds--cooled--and spilled over lips of outrage, consuming whatever was in its path.she went to the movies instead.

It is bleak. Put simply, this is a book about how our inhumane system of racism and misogyny created an environment where a little girl could be re-victimized and re-traumatized over and over again. It is about our failure to care for the most vulnerable, the most marginalized among us. What does it say about our society that a twelve-year-old girl can hate herself so much due to the messages she has received her entire life that her only wish is that she has blue eyes? What does it say that she can measure her worth in terms of her proximity to whiteness?

She is stripped of her voice, her identity. It's no coincidence that Pecola is unable to tell her own story; we are reading it filtered through the lens of the people who allowed this to happen to her.This is a powerful, necessary, and evocative read that will disturb the comfortable.

Toni Morrison crafted an intricate novel about the life of a young black girl growing up in an oppressive environment who yearns for blue eyes. The structure of this novel is different from most. Instead of following a plot from beginning to end, the author decided to structure each chapter around different characters connected to the young girl to give the character's backstory. These chapters are important for the reader to understand the motives of the characters and alter the readers' perspective of the characters. Each of these chapters shifts the readers' perspective slightly. The reader doesn't feel empathy or sympathy, the reader just views the character and their action in a more complete way. And that is what makes this book brilliant.Morrison's writing is absolutely beautiful. Her writing is poetic and lyrical combined with the right amount of bluntness. Her writing seamlessly transitions from first person to third without being choppy or awkward. A big portion of this book's success can be attributed to her writing style. The writing changes as the story and characters change, which creates a more cohesive story.Overall, I really enjoyed this novel and what it had to say.

The Bluest Eye  is a very well-written book, narrated by Pecola's friend both as a child and as an adult. The book is divided into seasons, a sort of ""child time"", and explores the psychology not only of the narrator and Pecola, but of those who harmed her.

This was a powerful book and Morrison’s First. The title, The Bluest Eye speaks of the ingrained hatred black people absorb. Picola Breedlove is considered ugly. She comes from a troubled family and her mother considers beauty, money, elegance to be the highest priority. She is willing to sacrifice her daughter to keep up this way of thinking. The characters in this story are wonderful. Picola is a character you just route for, even though you know her fate. Her biggest wish is to have ‘Blue Eyes’. Then her life will work and bad things will not happen. She will have the perfect life she envisions and thinks other white girls have. Then she will be good enough. However, what life has in store for her is much different even when she is convinced she has beautiful blue eyes. This book was originally written in 1970. The story is supposed to take place in 1941. Much has changed since this time, and much remains the same. For women of different colors to see their beauty and others to value it, is still not fully at that point. I read this for Banned Book Week. I will read Beloved by Toni Morrison, too.

It is immensely emotional, tragic and haunting. “Begun as a bleak narrative of psychological murder, the main character could not stand alone since her passivity made her a narrative void.” One might ask why Toni would want to write this story.Her response was:“The origin of the novel lay in a conversation I had with a childhood friend.” Her friend wanted blue eyes. That made Toni angry.“This novel was Toni’s way of saying that beauty is not something to behold or wish for, but it was something one could do.” She wondered how one learns self-loathing. “Who had looked at her and found her so wanting, so small a wight on the beauty scale? The novel pecks away at the gaze that condemned her [Pecola].”“I focused, therefore, on how something as grotesque as the demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child; the most vulnerable member: a female.”This story also highlights the seemingly unbreakable cycle of generational damage, including physical, emotional and psychological. One of my favorite lines from nine-year old narrator Claudia is:“I destroyed white baby dolls.” I laughed out load because I had done the same thing, but for different reasons.

And owning them made her part of the world, and the world a part of her.""-Even though I have a pretty decent collection of Toni Morrison books, I hadn't read any of them until today. I picked up The Bluest Eye and didn't put it down until I finished it. I just felt that her legacy is owed that. For us all to explore the beauty and wisdom and pain in each of her books. I'm glad I didn't read these when I was younger, as I would have missed so much. I know she herself admitted that this wasn't a perfect book, but it captivated me. The language, the characters, the depth of understanding of human nature were all phenomenal. I love that she didn't write for white people. I love how fiercely she stood in truth and refused to deny it. All of my love to her and the wonderful gift she left us in her art. I will be reading the rest of her books this year in publication order.Show more"

Morrison is a master of the written word, and her prose manages to be both lyrical and unpretentious, allowing the reader to truly sink into her tale as if they were there whilst also being taken over by the flow of language. She brought the tales of the Breedlove family (and others surrounding them) to life in a way that made me feel sick, confused, and sad all at once.I can't say that I particularly enjoyed the reading experience of this book, as it was so utterly depressing and the ending felt devoid of any hope. I think I threw this book at my friend who suggested I read it as a joke, I felt so mixed upon closing the covers. However, this has not deterred me from reading more of Morrison's work - rather, it has made me see what a terrific writer she is, and I am eager to check out more of her work. I'll just prepare myself for more dark and depressing subjects.Show more"

It took me a while to get into, but I was painfully immersed in it soon enough. I have never read about race and identity the way Morrison writes it. There is complete devastation in her story, and complete beauty in her writing. Her subject is 11 year old Pecola Breedlove, who grows up believing she is unlovable due to a total lack of nurturing from her parents, and becomes the perfect target for society to further push her into obscurity. Through Pecola, we learn about internalised racism. Through her abusers, we learn that people can be cruel by circumstances. Morrison refuses to dehumanise those who contribute to Pecola's collapse, showing us their own sorrows, which is perhaps what astonished me the most. That we are a sick society is known to most of us, but once in a while, there are writers who make us acknowledge it in a chilling manner, and this author is one such for me. 4/5 for this mirror no one wants to look into.Show more"

The world viewed through the eyes of a young girl is a fascinating perspective for a middle-aged man, I suppose. She makes the story come alive with all its attendant unpleasantness. The truth is African Americans are seldom treated as they should be, with the same respect and regard we should have for all human beings. It is uncomfortable to be reminded that we still haven't reached the place we should be in society. Actually, it is a place we should have reached long ago. Morrison's prose draws the reader in, but be warned, there are adult situations. They are described as a young person might understand them, however. A classic.Some further fumbling thoughts may be found here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World.Show more"

Or more like, I’ve struggled to even digest them and come to terms with what I read in the book.Pecola is a young Black girl who wants blue eyes, just like Shirley Temple. Her desire for them is so great that she believe it will completely change her fortunes. The chapters alternate between different timelines and we learn about Pecola and her parents, the harsh realities they face and the absence of stability in their lives as racism, both overt and institutional, keeps them in a state of persistent deterioration and chips away at them until the unthinkable happens.I said before that this was a painful read. The immense poverty overlapping with misogyny and racism makes it an indescribably troubling book. Most disturbingly is the presence of paedophilia and how the paedophile chooses to justify it in his twisted way. I didn’t like The Bluest Eye. Because it’s not a book to be liked.

I was enjoying this story in the general way that I thought Toni Morrison is an incredibly talented writer, able to create multiple voices that are nuanced, and complex characters that you feel you really know, despite how short the book is. Then the last part kicked in, and I struggled... struggled because she did it too well. She made me understand characters I despised, which made me uncomfortable and left me searching for a way out of these characters' heads. I both love and hate this kind of writing -- sticking you with the characters you don't want to be with, and doing so it so damn well.I think this book needs to sit with me for a while before I really understand my thoughts and feelings, but I am definitely going to be picking up another Toni Morrison soon.Show more"

The grotesque imagery she uses suits the subject matter. The Bluest Eye is about a girl named Pecola who is raped and impregnated by her father. She wants more than anything to have the bluest eyes. Suprisingly, most reviewers refuse to mention the disturbing subject matter in Morrison's works. Why the silence? Especially in our trigger warning culture, you'd think that more people would mention the vulgar themes in Morrison's books. I don't generally go for such themes, but I enjoyed (if I can even use that term) The Bluest Eye for its beautiful prose and its unpredictable story-line. Morrison writes in the afterward that she wanted to put the reader ""on edge"". She definitely succeeded. I recommend The Bluest Eye, but be warned. It's one disturbing novel!Show more"

The authors note was really insightful and I hope anyone who reads this book also makes sure to read the authors note. The story centers on Pecola who wishes for blue eyes as she believes that this white feature will make her pretty. Throughout the book her ugliness is reinforced by those around her and she accepts it as fact. Her dysfunctional family Makes her reality even worse. Probably the most important takeaway is how society has taught young children to think of themselves as ugly because they do not possess Caucasian features and that these beliefs can have such profoundly negative affects in young children who do not ever grow out of it.

Because there's barely anything from Pecola herself, for example. And at the end, after describing how badly Pecola's life was impacted by what her father did, we get a line that says that he loved her in his own way.

Yet, since I am perceived as white, and treated by individuals and society as white, I am therefore racialized as white. I acknowledge this and all the reckoning that follows. I say this because reflecting on this work invites a reader's double consciousness. Before I go further, I break tone here to note that it is my intention to read every gift Toni Morrison has left to American letters. While I agree with the self-assessment Morrison leaves in her afterword, I'm less critical of the work than she. In the end, I was both touched and moved. This was my second of hers, after Song of Solomon. I quote here from her afterword (1993) so that this scribbling will be more self-reliant. One problem was centering: the weight of the novel’s inquiry on sodelicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers intothe comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves forthe smashing. My solution—break the narrative into parts that had to bereassembled by the reader—seemed to me a good idea, the execution ofwhich does not satisfy me now. Besides, it didn’t work: many readersremain touched but not moved.  The other problem, of course, was language. Holding the despisingglance while sabotaging it was difficult. The novel tried to hit the raw nerveof racial self-contempt, expose it, then soothe it not with narcotics but withlanguage that replicated the agency I discovered in my first experience ofbeauty.The role of white racialization on a first read of this textA unbroken series of life experiences that results in racialized whiteness informs my reading of this work. So, for example, my white childhood was privileged from the perspective of not being aware of being racialized. I was taught not to engage in active racism. I was sure that I heeded this moral imperative. Nonetheless, I experienced my whiteness as a neutral and generalized. If I had come upon this work without the experiences, conversations, readings that have since disrupted such naivety, I feel quite certain that I would have fallen into Morrison's ""centering"" problem. (This is not to pat myself on the back--a true commitment to anti-racism will require constant vigilance, interrogation, conversation, criticism, allyism, etc. over the course of the rest of my life). I would have, likewise, been ill-equipped to handle Morrison's ""language"" problem--though increasingly, I'm coming to understand racial self-contempt.Show more"

That should be obvious. And yet, I think the book makes stereotyping a tempting thing to do.There are sections- Pecola at the candy counter, the Breedloves' apartment, the prostitutes talking, any scene of a group of women talking- that are so immersive that they feel real. You feel like you are getting insight into forbidden territory. Because it is so vivid, it runs the danger of drowning out any other perspective you may have on African American culture. I think that may have been an oversight on the author's part.This being Morrison's first book, she probably wrote it more for herself and her immediate community than, for example, me. There is a certain amount of cultural and language information that the reader is assumed to have. (I had to look up the word ""trifling"" on urban dictionary.*) Part of the assumed knowledge is enough perspective on African American life to prevent overgeneralization.Structural experimentsIn the forward, Morrison refers to structural experiments that were not fully successful. I agree to a degree. The Dick and Jane interludes were not well connected to the rest of the text. The Soapy Church segment was told in three different ways when one would have been more powerful. The shifting perspectives in the Spring portion were a little ragged, and the narrative bogged down as a result. None of these things are deal-breakers, though, and they are easily worth getting past to benefit from the heart of the book.The endingYou know how this book will end from the first page. However, Morrison's literary techniques, beginning with Soapy's letter and continuing through Pecola's conversation and the final monologue, are so powerful and effectively constructed that you are swept away. The last few pages of this book are the most symphonic display of figurative language and symbolism that I can think of.*trifling (adj.)- morally or physically unclean and therefore worthlessShow more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51306330-april,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"September 18, 2022",3 likes,0,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫""The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison was very insightful. Thankfully, my book club discussion today was just what I needed to help process this powerful read. Although the novel is quite the masterpiece in regards to such visceral, genius, and poetic writing, it was heavy. It was oftentimes uncomfortable and not easy to read. Please note that there are many triggers such as racism, sexual assault, child abuse, alcohol abuse, animal abuse, and mental health struggles.Despite the many topics of concern, “The Bluest Eye” is still a must read (for those capable of handling such content). One member mentioned reading it “should not be done in isolation” - as in, have someone nearby to discuss the book after. I agree with this sentiment. This is likely why our discussion felt necessary and helped me process the story. It’s easy to understand why so many readers love Morrison’s books. Her writing was quite bold, while pointing out brutal issues that need to be analyzed--as they should be.By using various points of view, Morrison forces readers to experience the plot in a very purposeful manner. Oftentimes the narrative is told through the innocent eyes of a child, and other times told through third person to help humanize the inhumane characters. This tool caused a lot of mixed feelings, but stirred more contemplation. I don't quite know how to explain how it was both nauseating to read, but also making connections as to why such morbid events occurred. Readers are encouraged to examine their own ideals of beauty, privilege, self-worth, and that of others within society - especially in the Black demographic. Other emotions or topics prominent within the novel were empathy, compassion, shame, guilt, self-loathing, love, poverty, wealth, and many more. Honestly, this book was more emotional than I expected, but I'm thankful to have read it. Looking forward to reading more by Morrison, but will definitely need to mentally prepare for the work that goes along with the reading.Until next time,Happy Reading! 📚Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana,The Bluest Eye,Rating 5 out of 5,"July 2, 2015",3 likes,0,"With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison brings us into the world of Pecola Breedlove, a young girl whose self-concept/ego is stunted from developing, whose psyche is essentially murdered, by a combination of an internalization of negative societal images (of blacks, and of women) and a lack of a network of support. Morrison weaves narratives of people whose life spheres intersect with Pecola’s, because, as she explains in the preface, Pecola’s ego is too damaged to cohere its own story. In the end, the violent violation of Pecola by her very flesh (her father) is too much for her fragile, barely-formed ego to handle, and it disintegrates, leaving Pecola in a permanent state of oblivion and senility. The Bluest Eye explodes the “Dick and Jane” ideal, in which the values of the “West” are used as a measuring stick against which all other cultures are judged. In their very essence, Western ideals are hierarchical: they rely and ground themselves in a demarcation of spheres of inferiority and superiority. In this way, Western ideals are built through processes of exclusion (and inclusion).Morrison explores how such a culture, in which only one ideal is accepted as superior, in which a hierarchy dictates how individuals think about the worth of things, can damage the soul/ego/person of individuals who are on the lowest rungs of the hierarchy, for their gender, race, and class, and how some individuals defy this ego-death. Through the intertwining stories of two sisters who are socially and economically in the same position as Pecola, but who have additional means of coping with the oppressive environment (such as intimate relationships with each other and with their parents, for example), Morrison shows how it is possible to make meaning and develop agency in spite of oppression. Primarily, Morrison implies, such resistance is made possible through the strength and resilience of social, personal, and familial networks.The picture Morrison paints is not ultimately one of bleakness and social death. In fact, most characters in The Bluest Eye find ways of making meaning in their lives in spite of societal conditions. Pauline, for example, affirms herself by claiming her pain in childbirth as valid, her body just as sensitive as white women’s: “I hurt just like them white women…. What’d they think? That just ‘cause I knowed how to have a baby with no fuss that my behind wasn’t pulling and aching like theirs?” (125). Claudia’s mother, on the other hand, learned to cope in ways similar to whites, yellows, browns, and all others: “she developed a hatred for things that mystified or obstructed her; acquired virtues that were easy to maintain; assigned herself a role in the scheme of things; and harked back to simpler times for gratification” (126). Claudia and her sister coped within the bounds of their intimate relationship with each other, and more or less understanding that despite their mother’s fits of wrath and their father’s absence, essentially they were loved, provided for, and protected. They had a home, they were not ‘outdoors’, like Pecola.At the core of the novel is a reliance on relationships to tell the story of Pecola, as Morrison explores the web of influences within which Pecola suffers her tragic ego-death. Each relationship manifests itself as some sort or expression of love. Pecola’s rape is instantiated by an urge in her father to recreate with her what he had had with Pauline long before their marriage had disintegrated into endless fighting. Cholly glances tenderly at Pecola’s foot wrapped around her calf and is reminded of a time when he felt loved, and loved deeply. Soaphead’s perversion also begins in love: he describes with affection his affinity for little girls. They are, essentially, the only ones around whom he feels perfectly safe, because he does not feel violated by them—their bodies don’t offend him. He is not “a pervert” in that at heart, he craves the bodies of little girls. However, his instinct for love and its transformation into action has been perverted. Taking solace in the only type of body that could not possibly hurt him, he hurts back, he becomes the oppressor. Thus the colonized/oppressed becomes the colonizer/oppressor. Soaphead mimics the oppressive conditions by which he feels violated in replicating the power asserted over him into power asserted by him onto little girls. Although oppressing conditions have the power to pervert manifestations of love, The Bluest Eye is not only a story of perversion, it is also a story of transformation. “Love is never better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe” (206). And, it should be added, good people love deeply and unselfishly. Claudia’s father, for example, protects her from manly conquest, her mother nurtures her, while her sister loves her openly, honestly, and deeply. And so Claudia understands what anyone might arguably recognize as a constructive image of love: on Christmas day, for example, Claudia imagines her ideal present—sitting in mamma’s kitchen, her daddy playing the violin, her senses fully engaged, enveloped in love. Pecola, who feels no such stability from her mother because Pauline’s home is essentially her white employers’, also receives no support from her brother, who is often missing, and is not only not protected by her father in the face of manly aggression, but is violated by him. As such, it is perhaps not surprising that she does not seem to understand love, how to ‘get it’: Pecola constantly asks others, “How do you do that? How do you get somebody to love you?” (32).--------------------------------------------------------------I am shocked at some of the insensitive reviews this work has received (especially on Amazon, to complement some of the reviews on GR); from individuals who write with vehemence that this book is ""pornography"" to those who think it's too unrealistic or depressing, I wonder at the privilege and whiteness expressed on these forums, at the entitlement and hierarchical understanding we harbor deeply in our psyches, and at the insecurity we have for admitting the openness this book exposes us to into our lives.(PS: I am white, female, and privileged--I have a bed, food every day, and even internet, to write on here. I am very grateful to Morrison for bringing me out of my bubble, one word at a time).Show more"

It took me nearly the entire month to get through this book but I felt it was important to really take my time and consult outside sources.There is A LOT to unpack about this story but I’d like to focus on the tragic effects of colorism on Pecola Breedlove. From the very beginning, we learn that Pecola, a dark skinned girl with dark brown eyes and curly hair, is repeatedly verbally abused because of her skin. She wishes to have blue eyes if only to ease the burden of her skin and to stop the people of her small Ohio town for hating her because of it. Pecola finds her greatest comfort with a group of sex workers that live above her family home because they are some of the few people in the entire town that do not despise her. Pecola is shunned by all of the other children in the story too, leaving her friendless and isolated. She is utterly powerless in the world she inhabits and her own father, recognizing her powerlessness, violently and selfishly abuses her. This abuse acts as the final straw in Pecola’s destruction and we are forced to watch a once innocent little girl tumble down a path of no return, all of which is rooted in her skin and the way she is treated because of it.The unique perspectives of the children in the story, especially Pecola, make it raw and heartbreaking. Speaking as a POC who was once an innocent child, I was fortunate enough to never have to consider the ways in which racism and colorism might affect my day to day however, this is the single most prevalent problem in Pecola’s life and the foundation for every single event that pushes her over the edge.This is Miss Morrison’s first novel and she was 39 years old when it was published. In the author’s note, she mentions not loving her style in this book however I couldn’t find a single flaw with it. For now I will be rating all of her books as 4⭐️ until I complete her catalog. I will then edit the ratings against the quality of her work as I feel that that’s the only fair way to go about it. I’m starting Sula next month and I couldn’t be more excited.Show more"

I mean, how do you get somebody to love you?” but Frieda was asleep. And I didn’t know.The hardest thing in my opinion is to give reasons as to why you love certain things and to say that “I just you do”, is not enough. When asked, one is forced to dissect the very thing they love and in the process, probably end up killing it. I’ll not do that. I won’t tear The Bluest Eye open in my search for reasons. I will just leave it like one does the feel of a cool wind on one’s skin, unbothered about its origin but simply glad to have been touched.Having read Beloved last year and finding it quite impenetrable especially in the beginning (and also the last few pages), I was in the mindset that this too would be in the same line. But to my surprise it’s one of the easiest books out there if only one pays just the right amount of attention. There’s no doubt that Toni Morrison could conjure sentences like no other, that reading them one can’t tell the difference between poetry and prose, so thin and delicate the line. In Bluest Eye, Morrison examines the birth of self-loathing, public gaze and desire to be as beautiful in the eyes of others. Through different stories, Morrison solidifies the journey of Pecola, the “ugliest” black girl” in the search of beauty which means and aligns with Whiteness. What Pecola wants are blue eyes, the bluest of blue. Like Beloved, this too is a heartbreaking story, done more so with the innocent narration by Claudia. I’ll end on a line with which the book starts, “Quiet as it’s kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941.” Show more"

I had forgotten how utterly bold and brave she was to tell the story of poor black girls who lived in an almost parallel universe to the DICKJANEMOTHERFATHER world that America portrayed itself to be. Their existence was an anathema to world that the ruling majority convinced themselves represented the American Life. Poor black girls who fought the urge to despise their blackness and to aspire to an ideal they could never attain—whiteness. One who lost the battle. One who loathed the white doll she was supposed to adore. One who was overtaken by the uncertainty of her blue eyes. This book was a masterpiece in it’s time—and still is—because it dares to tell the story of ordinary lives lived under systemic subjugation and the bitter sweetness of half freedom. This was a book for black people and about black people that goes deep into the heart of complicated love that is always battling self-hate.Toni Morrison was once asked by an interviewer if she maybe shouldn’t start writing about white people: as If—and this is my interpretation—you are a brilliant writer. So why don’t you start writing about the people who matter. Tony looked at this woman and said, “ You have no idea how profoundly racist that question is, do you?

The sentence structure and the way words were framed really lingered in my mind and had me compelled to read out sections.The Bluest Eye is the novel I had originally wanted to read from Morrison, however I got to Sula first (reading vlog: https://youtu.be/GtuaSmwogXk), of which I was left a little underwhelmed, so not to put me off, I snapped up this book as soon as I found a copy and I'm so glad I did.This was a really sad story, focusing on a trio of young girls, and their observation of the world around them really, but centering more specifically on Picola, who has so much internalized racism to herself and self hatred of her blackness and, apparently by default, ugliness. She becomes obsessed that the only way to be beautiful by societal standards is to have blue eyes, like many of her white peers. There is also displays of colourism within the black community, which really shows how deep this internalized racism goes, within history, that one can believe them better than others due to the lighter tone of their skin and the stereotyping of others. There was actually a really horrible scene, with animal abuse, that, if you know me, know that really effects me but the whole point of it was to show another example of how cruel people can be to other beings, but this example was so the character that abused the animal could put the blame on Picola as well as humiliate her. In this case, the other character was from a family who believes that lighter means better and it really just impacted me and made me feel so incredibly heavy.It is so sad because you're presented these feelings through the eyes of a child, and for them to have learned this so young is heart breaking, but also is, unfortunately, still a reality, even today.However, despite the difficult topics, it was so moreish, and I found myself (at one point) staying up until 2am reading it, not even realising how much time had passed.Originally, I had thought it was just going to be the story of Pecola, through her girlhood and all the things that troubled her as she struggled to find her place in a world that found her less than anything, mainly told through the perspective of her two neighbours/friends (Claudia and Frieda), but, much like Sula, we go back throughout the family history, learn about individuals of the household's past, and how they came to be in the present of this narrative. This was something I enjoyed from Sula, and despite The Bluest Eye being Morrison's debut, I actually think it was done better in this novel. It was easy to read, had me absorbed, but didn't lack on the beauty of the writing, even if it was writing about hard and horrible times.This book really moved me, not as close to tears as I thought it could, but just enough. The afterword was very interesting to see inside Morrison's head a bit, in terms of where she wanted this story to go, but the foreword could have done without because it was pretty much an abridged version of the afterword.Overall, I'm glad I read The Bluest Eye and I'm looking forward to reading more Morrison.Pick it up, give it a go and enjoy! >(^_^)<GénShow more"

I'm finding it difficult to gather my thoughts on this book, so please excuse in advance what will inevitably be a deficient review. This book is intense, full of symbolism, and a whirlwind of sorrow and life. Each section of this book threatens to shake the world beneath your feet. So wonderfully written, Morrison's prose is already striking here in her debut; beautifully constructed and repugnant when it demands it to be so. An excerpt I particularly enjoy because I think it speaks for itself:""My daddy's face is a study. Winter moves into it and presides there. His eyes become a cliff of snow threatening to avalanche; his eyebrows bend like black limbs of leafless trees. His skin takes on the pale, cheerless yellow of winter sun; for a jaw he has the edges of a snowbound field dotted with stubble; his high forehead is the frozen sweep of the Erie, hiding currents of gelid thoughts that eddy in the darkness. Wolf killer turned hawk fighter, he worked night and day to keep one from the door and the other from under the windowsills. A Vulcan guarding the flames, he gives us instructions about which doors to keep closed or opened for proper distribution of heat, lays kindling by, discusses qualities of coal, and teaches us how to rake, feed, and bank the fire. And he will not unrazor his lips until spring.""It's a shame this book is being banned, but its power explains why. As one of my classmates noted, people don't want to look at the truth--and that's all this book is. Show more"

The Bluest Eye, which is as painfully relevant today as it was in 1970, contains excerpts that genuinely push you as a reader, and force you to consider attitudes and mindsets that you may find intolerable, or unfathomable; however, through Toni Morrison’s prose, these passages strike at a truth in humanity that should not go ignored. The only other novel I’ve read by Morrison is Beloved, which was instantly one of my very favourites. The Bluest Eye similarly experiments with perspective, form and tense, in a way that can feel slightly jarring here in a way that it did not with Beloved. As this book is so short, the constant shifting in time period and narrative perspective at times kept me at too much of a distance from the characters and their tragic experiences. I found myself wishing that the novel would slow down and stay still; really, I think it could have been a hundred pages longer and been better for it.Morrison’s writing is so strong that this is only a minor issue with the novel, especially considering how impressive a debut it is. The last few chapters build up to a final paragraph that hits you like a train, and perfectly summarises everything Morrison grapples with in the book. I could see myself reading it again years from now and finding it perfect after all. Show more"

The Bluest Eye is a great representation of the effects of generational trauma and the toxicity that manifests in people's desires from that trauma. As the book moves between each complex character, we are transported into different years. Though this time movement may not ideal for some people, I thought it was the perfect way to reveal the important history that leads to Pecola Breedlove to desire blue eyes.Morrison does not hold back in the slightest and looking up the trigger warnings is important. This book had me sobbing. ""He does not see her, because for him there is nothing to see. How can a fifty-two-year old white immigrant storekeeper with the taste of potatoes and beer in his mouth, his mind honed on the doe-eyed Virgin Mary, his sensibilities blunted by a permanent awareness of loss, see a little black girl?

With her everything feels (and is) deliberate; descriptions are sensual and poetic and still necessary. Certainly a writer that does not need to hide behind flowery diversions or frivolous distractions; her skills are so strong in both plot and prose that the work sings for itself.Once again an interesting cast of characters. What I liked about Pecola was that she was so real. Compared to some other literary victims, she is not stylised and warped by narration like Dolores Haze or idealised and martyred to the point of ridiculousness like Yanagihara's Jude. What happens to her is made all the more awful because she is truly a little girl with dirt around her ears stuck in the transitional period from blissful ignorance to knowledge. The people in her orbit are also treated so tenderly but not gently. The story is narrated by two other little girls which was a good decision as it gives it an intimate immediacy (if a sort of short-sightedness). The suffering is awful but not cloying.Sometimes I don't like how the same word is repeated twice in a sentence even though it makes sense and is utilitarianWill think about this for a long timeShow more"

I must admit that this was probably going to be a 4-star read for me until I got to the afterword. Morrison’s analysis and critique of her own work years later as well as her intentions made this story even more meaningful for me.Racial oppression and the oppression of women are the two biggest intermingling themes of this book. Young Pecola is taught early that whiteness is the standard of beauty and that she will therefore never be beautiful. This is reinforced through a story of, not just her life but of, those who came before her.This book is heartbreaking. The family dysfunction, aggression, systemic self-hatred, and history of trauma that is embedded in the Breedlove family DNA all tug at you with Morrison’s beautiful prose.This isn’t a straightforward read. Although it’s short, the storyline can feel a little disjointed.

I'd forgotten about how depressing sections of the book could be, however. (I couldn't finish the chapter about what happens to a cat belonging to one character. I don't doubt things like this happened: my father used to tell stories about the horrible things he and his friends would do to cats they'd caught on the farm c. 1930s. But after four years of seeing heartless cruelty broadcast on the news, I just cannot deal with it in my leisure reading.) Morrison is exquisitely good at capturing the emotional and physical trauma inflicted by racism and poverty. Her compassion, even for her most heinous characters, warms scenes that would otherwise be gut wrenching to read. I'm glad I had the opportunity to go back and read what once was merely a college assignment lo these 40+ years ago. I also understand now why 19-year-old me didn't like the novel.

The parts of the book I have trouble processing are those in which we saw actions of abuse/pedophilia through the eyes of various abusers.

Morrison explores nuisances of the wider issue of internalised racism and asks the reader to evaluate their part in such a phenomenon. What has the privileged white media/society done (and what does it continue to do) to perpetuate the myth that white is synonymous with beauty, whereas black is the antonym?

It is one of the most heartbreaking, well-written pieces of literature I've ever encountered. But I rate based on enjoyment and due to the nature of this story, while I was intrigued and it kept me reading, I can't say that I (or anyone) should /enjoy/ the last 1/3-1/4 of this book. I feel I should still rate it the highest it can be for the quality of it.I can't, and personally won't, list out all the ways this novel has affected me and my knowledge and experience with racism, classism, sexism, and the ways modernity has & has not improved these conditions (both in ways I personally understand and others that I merely attempt to). One of the reviews on the back cover notes this story is ""one black girl's entire universe"" and that is the only possible way to describe it. It took me to a world and a mindset and a time that I never had insight to before, opened my eyes to a lot.Who should read this book? While fiction, lovers of historical accounts/memoirs may enjoy this post-depression era story. Or people seeking to understand deeper intricacies of racism (the author herself cites ""internecine racism"" as one of the main purposes for writing it).

Maybe this was just a personal issue, maybe the execution wasn't done well. It's Morrison's first book after all. Her writing style is just phenomenal though, I've rarely read anything this poetic. The book is not a light read, it made me angry, depressed, anxious even. I know this is the reality for a lot of people.

I have no doubt it helped some people say ""hell no"" and simply not continue reading it, and it helped prepare me for it when it did happen. (Although she didn't warn about abuse to an animal, dammit.)If not already obvious: this is an uncomfortable novel. I don't think there's any male character in it who is a ""good"" person, and a lot of the women (both adult and child) are flawed. But she provides some backstory vignettes for almost every character, which certainly doesn't excuse their actions, but at least gives some suggestions as to where things went wrong --although even that's really hard to pin down aside from poverty, just one downstream result of racism. And several characters illustrate that Religion is not a solution, it's just another tool which empowers abusers and encourages passive-aggressively pushing down others while attempting to raise your social status.I'm really selling it, huh? So why read this? The writing is incredible. period. I almost had trouble believing it was someone's first book, let alone written in 1977.

This is not an uplifting read. But the characters, and the very real feelings and circumstances they represent, are powerfully drawn. There is an explicit rape scene which is awful to read, but really drives home the devastation of this wishful, innocent girl who cannot, because of the culture that surrounds her, see her beauty.Show more"

Toni Morrison te grita al oído en esta novela. Te revuelve las entrañas. Pero no ha conseguido engancharme a la narración, de ahí las 3 estrellas. Tuve que leer el primer párrafo de esta novela varias veces ya que me parecía que no podía ser lo que estaba yo interpretando. Pero si, la vida de Pecola, una niña negra de 12 años en 1941 era un horror ya en el cuarto renglón del libro. La autora nos explica cómo rompen en pedazos la vida de una ni��a inocente su propia familia, sus vecinos, sus amigas, todo humano que la rodea. Ella nace con la idea de que tener la piel negra es algo horrible y su máxima en la vida sería tener los ojos azules que son los correctos, los buenos, los bonitos como lo son las niñas blancas que ella ve en los anuncios. Eso es lo que le transmite el mundo a Pecola. La autora quiere reivindicar la belleza racial, el orgullo de raza y lo hace desde el lado opuesto, mostrándonos a donde puede llevar el creerse y hacer que creas que eres menos que otras personas por tu piel, por el color de tus ojos, por tu religión, costumbres, tradiciones.

This novel is chock-full of difficult content but is well worth reading, in spite of - and also because - of it. The difficult content is central to the novel's exploration of internalized racism. I am especially struck by this novel being Morrison's first published work. It sure is a definitive way to begin one's literary career.

Scenes involving abuse were always delivered from the 3rd person perspective of the abuser, or otherwise very indirectly… the pain at the center of the book, and the person feeling pain, is so intense that it has to be circled around for the entire text.

I think now, because we live in a different age, beauty in a dark skinned black woman is not as strange, and our esteem is 1) less likely to be killed when young 2) more likely to be regained when older, that we (I at times) look at black women without that esteem (especially when it’s shows up as contempt for traditionally black features, and desire for white ones) with annoyance. I forget, maybe because I grew up in a Black country, with a mother who called me “duduyemi” (translates to dark skinned beauty) that the self loathing is not unwarranted. What Toni Morrison did with this book show that. She took us through all the incremental moments in the ultimate internal destruction of a dark skinned girl. Every event, whether “small” or “big” added up in a way that unfortunately made total sense. I understood all the characters, as much as I didn’t want to at times, as much as I wanted to curse them for not doing right by their daughter/friend/sister.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71074115-aya-mohammed,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 6, 2019",3 likes,0,"توني موريسون، الكاتبة الأفرو – أمريكية و المعروفة بكتاباتها التي لا تخلو من محاكاة العنصرية، و ما يقاسيه الأفرو – أمريكان في المجتمع الأمريكي، لم تتساهل أبدا مع سؤال كان قد طرح عليها، عن إذا ما كان بإمكانها تخيل الكتابة دون اقحام العنصرية فيما تكتبه، مما يعني، كتابة عن البيض، عن السود، دون تضخيم الذات الأمريكية كجلاد و حصر الذات الزنجية الأمريكية في قالب الضحية. و في ظل تاريخ من الهجوم لكتاباتها، هي لا تستيغ هذا السؤال، بل لا تفهم المغزى منه، و لا تجده سؤالا أدبيا حتى، فنحن لا يمكننا سؤال كاتب ما عما يستطيع كتابته أو لا، فالمخيلة الأدبية لا تتعلق بمقدرتنا على الكتابة بموضوع ما، أو من عدمها، هي سجينة الرغبة، و موريسون ما كان يهمها في الأدب، هو ما يتداعى منه. شخصية عدا كونها تتسم بلغة شعرية و ضلاعة روائية، فأكثر ما يجذبني نحوها هو قوتها، صلابة يمكنك استشعارها في عمق الألم. كََون تناول “العنصرية” كثيمة أساسية في أدب موريسون، هذا لا يلغي تجسيد المجتمع الزنجي، لا كضحية فقط تحت مجهر التمييز العرقي و إنما كشخصيات تخلو من المثالية، كإنسان مثلنا مثله، شخصيات هي الأخرى لها تعثراتها، تساهم بفعالية في خراب حياتها. و هذا ما تلاحظه كقاريء في أولى رواياتها “العين الأكثر زرقة” أسرتين كل منهما تتخذ موقفا مغايرًا للتعايش مع طبيعة الحياة و قسوتها، فبينما تستمر إحداها في المضي، متحدة كأسرة، تتحطم عائلة بريدلوف، تتشقق، بل على الأحرى تموت.تعود بنا كلوديا، إلى خريف عام 1941، بولاية أوهايو، و ذلك حينما كانت في التاسعة من عمرها، عندما أودعت السلطات الطفلة بيكولا بريدلوف عندهم، حيث أحرق والدها السكير منزلهم، خريف هذا العام، كان متقشفا رغم الأمل، لم تنبت بذور القطيفة و بيكولا الحامل من أبيها، مات طفلها عند ولادته، لم يجري شيء على ما يرام كما آملت كلوديا و أختها فريدا. بأسلوب درامي مُحكم، تقحمنا توني في مصيدتها الروائية، و التي اعتدمت على تشتيت ذهن القاريء و شده في آن واحد، فالرواية مروية بثلاثة أصوات عدا الكاتبة، تقودنا بمنظور الطلفة كلوديا و تفسيرها لعالمها، و أيضا تستبطن وعي تشوللي و بولين بريدلوف، و كل هذا يُروى بمسارات مختلفة من حيث الزمان و المكان. كلوديا، هي أكثر الشخصيات حيوية، و بدرجة كبيرة تؤثر في فهم القاريء لخلفية الحدث العامة، حيثُ يفقد الفقر الشديد صواب الجميع. تتقبل كلوديا فكرة رجلها الذي سيحبها قبل أن يهجرها، بناءًا على أغنيات أمها العذبة و المحببة لديها، و تستمتع بالمضي نحو غرفة المستأجر هنري و تفتيش مجلاته النسائية، رغ�� أن فريدا ترفض هذا الاقتراح، و في غمر ذعر شقيقتها من محاولة هنري للاعتداء عليها، تسألها إن كانت قد شعرت بشيء ما، لكنها لا تفهم بتاتًا انبهار قريناتها بشيرلي تمبل، بل حتى في أن يهدي��ا الكبار بعيد ميلادها دمية بيضاء، بعيون زرقاء، و شفاه ملونة، و من ثم يعتريهم الغضب عند تهشيمها لها، فهي عندما تقوم بتهشيمها، إنما تحاول اكتشاف جمالها و كونها مرغوبًا فيها، مالذي يجعل زملائها يتوددون إلى مورين بيل أو “ذات الناب” كما تلقبها، ما يجعلها جديرةً بالاهتمام، و تتساءل عن السبب الذي جعلها جميلةً و لم يجعلها كذلك.يتفق الجميع على كون عائلة بريدلوف، صورةٌ متكاملة من القبح، و كذلك يؤمن كل من أفرادها بأنه الأقبح، العائلة محطمة، لا تلتقي، إلا في شيء واحد و هو تحطيم بعضها البعض، و أيضًا تجسيدها للقبح بطريقتها، فتشوللي يبالغ في سكره و لامبالاته بمصير عائلته، عاطل عن العمل، أما بولين فهي لا تتردد أبدًا في الشجار معه أمام الأطفال، بغرض خلق المعنى، في ظل الجمود الأسري، و تتقمص ببراعة دور الأم البيضاء لطفلتها الشقراء، عند العائلة التي تعمل لديها، حيث تناديها بولي، في حين أن بيكولا و سامي يلقبانها بالسيدة بريدلوف. بيكولا مطوية بمكان ما يجعلها غير ظاهرة في الصورة، أما سامي فيعبر عن قبحه بترهيبه للآخرين، و هروبه المتواصل من المنزل. الأجواء مشحونة بالقسوة و العنف، لكن الشخصيات، تشوللي و بولين، تروي لنا تاريخ قبحها و أسبابه، بطريقة لا تستدرج تعاطفنا، إنما هكذا تحدث الأمور، انه أمر لا تختاره و لا تحاول تغلبه، فتشوللي، ابن زنا، لم يرى أمه مطلقًا، و في طريقه للتفوه باسمها عند لقائه الأول بوالده، لم يتذكر اسمها، و كان بالنسبة لوالده، شيء مجرد من القيمة، أكثر من لعب الورق، و لا تغيب عن باله، ذكرى ذُلت فيها رجولته بسخرية من البيض، لذا فثورته الشيطانية هذه، تشعره بكينونته المسرفة في السكر و الجنس و اليأس. أما بولين، فقد بدأ كل شيء، منذ لقائها بتشوللي، أو لنقل زواجها منه، و عند انتقالها معه إلى أوهايو، و على غرار كنتاكي، تمتلأ أوهايو بالمجاهر العنصرية، تتساقط أسنانها تدريجيا، و معها تدفن أجزاءًا من شخصيتها الحالمة. استخدام موريسون لسردية “ديك و جين” التعليمية للأطفال،في بداية الرواية وتكرارها لها في مقاطع عدة، لم تأتي من فراغ، هي تقلب الطاولة، لترينا بدلا من الصورة المثالية للعائلة السعيدة، صورة مُشوهة، وليدة الدونية.بيكولا صامتة، و لا نلحظ لحظة انفجارها إلا في الرمق الأخير من الرواية، لحظة صلاتها بأن تكون لها عيون زرقاء، ليراها الآخرين حقًا، فهي تظن بأنه حينها لن تكُون مهمشة، لن تكون مستبعدة في الفصل الدراسي، ربما كذلك ستحبها أمها، سيصبح كل شيء على ما يُرام، هي عند دخولها للمشعوذ العجوز، تمنت من أعماقها بأن تكون بعيون أخرى غير عيونها، لا من أجلها، بل من أجلهم هم، و هذا يفسر كرها ذاتيا مبنيًا على كُره الآخرين، ليس بالمعنى الحرفي، لكن تأثيرهم الواضح عليها سلبًا، هي تسأل: كيف تجعلين أحدهم يحبك؟نظرتنا للذات تتخلخل، عندما ننظر إليها بعيون الآخرين “سلبًا”، هذا يحدث، و السؤال الأكثر غموضا و وضوحا، ما هو الجمال؟ ما معاييره؟ و أيضًا إلى أيّ مدى من الإيمان بنا نحتاج، لكيّ لا نطمس ذاتنا، بسبب الآخرينالترجمة ممتازة و أفضل من ترجمة فاضل السلطاني، لكن عنوان الرواية الأصلي ""The Bluest Eye"" و فيه رمزية مفتعلة و لها أكثر من تفسير، لذا من المفترض أن يكون العين الأكثر زرقة، هذا شيء و الشيء الآخر هو غلاف الرواية.. كارثي لم يعجبني.Show more"

I struggle in reviewing this one—it has parts of it that are masterful and brutal and relevant, but where I struggled was the lack of plot, really, and how a lot of it felt like summaries instead of stories that were shown and immersive. I found myself often bored. But, the opening chapter—and how it was included throughout the chapters—was a masterpiece. The message it presented—becoming obsessed with fitting society’s standards of beauty and acceptance has a cost that sometimes is irreversible—is something timeless and what we do need to explore more as a society.

Toni Morrison En Mavi Göz'ü 1960'lı yıllarda yazmış. Kitabın trajik kahramanı Pecola ve çevresindeki karakterlerin anlatılarıyla zenginleşen sert bir kitap ve Morrison 200 sayfaya onlarca öykü, tema sığdırmış.

Son sayfada, kitapta sıklıkla araya giren anlatıcı Claudia'nın sözleri her şeyi özetliyor: ''Hepimiz, Pecola'yı tanıyan herkes, çöpümüzü onun üzerine atıp temizlendikten sonra çok sağlıklı hissediyorduk kendimizi. Bacaklarımızı açarak onun çirkinliğinin üzerine bindiğimizde çok güzel görünüyorduk. Onun yalınlığı bizi süslüyor, suçu bizi temize çıkarıyor, acısı yanaklarımıza renk katıyor, sakarlığı da bize mizah duygumuzun olduğunu düşündürtüyordu. Tutuk oluşu güzel konuştuğumuza inandırıyordu bizi. Yoksul oluşu bizi eli açık yapıyordu. Uyanıkken gördüğü düşleri bile karabasanlarımızı yatıştırmakta kullanıyorduk.

First, Is Morrison attempting to delegitimate hegemonic or “White” standards of maternal performance? Conversely, is her intention to castigate the African American matriarch for her inability to get it right, even, and especially, in the face of oppression? Certainly, the pattern of seemingly sarcastic references to the Dick, Jane, Mother, and Father family model suggests both. Her side by side depictions of the Breedloves and the Macteers illustrates important differences between the effective Black family and the defective Black family. After all, Mr. MacTeer protects his child against the very sexual violence which Pecola’s own father perpetrates against her. Moreover, the repeated juxtapositions of the archetypical American family unit with the broken and unnatural Black family could be read as a rhetorical device, one designed to convince black audiences to consider, for the sake of the children, conforming to more appropriate, and more American, codes of familial conduct. However, Christopher Bollen of Interviewer Magazine writes “The author’s journey through the literary landscape has always been one of defiance” (n.p). He continues, “It goes without saying that Morrison’s literature tackles the national themes of racism and sexism, but her work also resists many of the pervasive liberal dogmas of her time, particularly the Black movement’s interest in only presenting positive portrayals of Black characters and second-wave feminism’s tendency to diminish the significance of motherhood” (Bollen). More specifically, her purpose in writing is not so much to reproduce reductive, gilded images of the Black family. Nor is it to perpetuate narratives of Black victimology. Nor, in fact, is she advocating for the addition of the Black woman to the neoliberal feminist clubhouse. While the novel makes occasional references to white racism, most especially where matters of physical blackness are concerned, the stories focus almost exclusively on African American complicity in their own difficulties.	This is most evident in her complex, and even unflattering characterization of the Breedlove Family. Deborah Werrlein’s “Not So Fast, Dick and Jane: Reimagining Childhood and Nation in The Bluest Eye” explores the relationship between internalized notions of inferiority and un-Americanness and the matriarch’s attitudes toward her natural duties as a mother. Of Mrs. Breedlove, she writes, “Pauline feels no patriotic obligation to nurture the offspring that, to her, reflect her own ugliness. Instead, having learned that a White family's servant wields far more power than a Black family's mother, she spends all her time working as a domestic for the Fishers, where ""Power, praise, and luxury were hers’” (Werrlein 60). More importantly, Werrlein situates Pauline between two hostile ideological spaces. At home, she is mother to the products of a union with an impotent drunk who neither loves nor respects her. At work, she subsists on the metaphorical crumbs that fall from a hegemonic family’s table. This depiction comes in defiance of critics like Larry Neal. The assertion is that rather than charging black matriarchs with responsibility for Black male impotence, Black patriarchs ought to accept responsibility for their wives’ emasculating defection to the “luxury” of the White men’s households.	Morrison is also critical of Black efforts to conform to “White” standards of familial conduct. Geraldine, an appropriately performing matriarch who submits to her husband and adheres to hegemonic behavior codes, appears to emblemize both Neal’s and Moynihan’s concept of the ideal wife and mother. Yet her function in the novel is to illustrate one of the more problematic archetypes of black womanhood. Guilty of the very treachery which Neal addresses in his explication of the wrong-headed, White-minded black matriarch, Geraldine harbors White hegemonic aspirations and values which result in a mal-adjusted, and certainly emasculated, son, one to whom she is a mere wire-monkey maternal figure. While Morrison is silent on Jr’s future, the implication is that his mother’s emasculating devotion to domestic matters other than him will culminate in the very violence which Neal describes as symptomatic of the black man’s emasculation. What I love is Morrison's simultaneous, take no prisoners attack on racism and on the ugliness that characterizes the black experience.Show more"

It’s just the way it is, and we have to accept it. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart. It crushes you, and just when things are picking up, you’re obliterated.

A sad that will never lessen. My heart aches, not for these characters, but all the others, the people Morrison knew, and the sadnesses they had, that caused her to put this sad on paper, so we all could share it. But would that make the sadness any better? Not for those people, maybe not even for their descendants, though one could hope that several generations down something will change. I hope so. But hope is not found in this story. Recommendation: When you finish, read page 3 again.Quotes that caught my eyeIt takes a long time for my body to heat its place in the bed. Once I have generated a silhouette of warmth, I dare not move, for there is a cold place one-half inch in any direction. (6)So when I think of autumn, I think of somebody with hands who does not want me to die. (7)Their conversation is like a gently wicked dance: sound meets sound, curtsies, shimmies, and retires. Another sound enters but is upstaged by still another: the two circle each other and stop. Sometimes their words move in lofty spirals; other times they take strident leaps, and all of it is punctuated with warm-pulsed laughter—like the throb of a heart made of jelly. The edge, the curl, the thrust of their emotions is always clear to Frieda and me. We do not, cannot, know the meanings of all their words, for we are nine and ten years old. So we watch their faces, their hands, their feet, and listen for truth in timbre. (9-10)Outdoors, we knew, was the real terror of life. The threat of being outdoors surfaced frequently in those days. Every possibility of excess was curtailed with it. If somebody ate too much, he could end up outdoors. If somebody used too much coal, he could end up outdoors. People could gamble themselves outdoors, drink themselves outdoors. Sometimes mothers put their sons outdoors, and when that happened, regardless of what the son had done, all sympathy was with him he was outdoors, and his own flesh had done it. To be put outdoors by a landlord was one thing—unfortunate, but an aspect of life over which you had no control, since you could not control your income. But to be slack enough to put oneself outdoors, or heartless enough to put one’s own kin outdoors—that was criminal. There is a difference between being put out and being put outdoors. If you are put out, you go somewhere else; if you are outdoors, there is no place to go. The distinction was subtle but final. Outdoors was the end of something, an irrevocable, physical fact, defining and complementing our metaphysical condition. Being a minority in both caste and class, we moved about anyway on the hem of life, struggling to consolidate our weaknesses and hang on, or to creep singly up into the major folds of the garment. Our peripheral e3xistence, however, was something we had learned to deal with—probably because it was abstract. But the concreteness of being outdoors was another matter—like the difference between the concept of death and being, in fact, dead. Dead doesn’t change, and outdoors is here to stay. (11)From the clucking sounds of adults I knew that the doll represented what they thought was my fondest wish. I was bemused with the thing itself, and the way it looked. What was I supposed to do with it?... I had only one desire: to dismember it. To see of what it was made, to discover the dearness, to find the beauty, the desirability that had escaped me, but apparently only me. Adults, older girls, shops, magazines, newspapers, window signs—all the world had agreed that a bule-eyed, yellow-haired, pink-skinned doll was what every girl child treasured. … I could not love it. But I could examine it to see what it was that all the world said was loveable. (13-14)I destroyed white baby dolls.But the dismembering of dolls was not the true horror. The truly horrifying thing was the transference of the same impulses to little white girls. The indifference with which I could have axed them was shaken only by my desire to do so. To discover what eluded me: the secret of the magic they weaved on others. What made people look at them and say, “Awwwww,” but not for me? (15)Each member of the family in his own cell of consciousness, each making his own patchwork quilt of reality—collecting fragments of experience here, pieces of information there. From the tiny impressions gleaned from one another, they created a sense of belonging and tried to make do with the way they found each other. (25)… a sofa that started off split, no good, and humiliating—you couldn’t take any joy in owning it. And the joylessness stank, pervading everything. The stink of it kept you from painting the beaverboard walls; from getting a matching piece of material for the chair; even from sewing up the split, which became a gash, which became a gaping chasm that e3xposed the cheap frame and cheaper upholstery. It withheld the refreshment in a sleep slept on it. It imposed a furtiveness on the loving done on it. Like a sore tooth that is not content to throb in isolation, but must diffuse its own pain to other parts of the body—making breathing difficult, vision limited, nerves unsettled, so a hated piece of furniture produces a fretful malaise that asserts itself throughout the house and limits the delight of things not related to it. (26-27) But the unquarreled evening hung like the first note of a dirge in sullenly expectant air. An escapade of drunkenness, no matter how routine, had its own ceremonial close. The tiny, undistinguished days that Mrs. Breedlove lived were identified, grouped, and classed by these quarrels. They gave substance to the minutes and hours otherwise dim and unrecalled. They relieved the tiresomeness of poverty, gave grandeur to the dead rooms. In these violent breaks in routine that were themselves routine, she could display the style and imagination of what she believed to be her own true self. To deprive her of these fights was to deprive her of all the zest and reasonableness of life. (30-31)Anger is better. There is a sense of being in anger. A reality and presence. An awareness of worth. It is a lovely surging. (37-38)They had extemporized a verse made up of two insults about matters over which the victim had no control; the color of her skin and speculations on the sleeping habits of an adult, wildly fitting in its incoherence. That they themselves were black, or that their own father had similarly relaxed habits was irrelevant. It was their contempt for their own blackness that gave the first insult its teeth. They seemed to have taken all of their smoothly cultivated ignorance, their exquisitely learned self-hatred, their elaborately designed hopelessness and sucked it all up into a fiery cone of scorn that had burned for ages in the hollows of their minds—cooled—and spilled over lips of outrage, consuming whatever was it its path. They danced a macabre ballet around the victim, whom, for their own sake, they were prepared to sacrifice to the flaming pit. (50)Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap. She forgot lust and simple caring for. She regraded love as possessive mating, and romance as the goal of the spirit. It would be for her a well-spring from which she would draw the most destructive emotions, deceiving the lover and seeking to imprison the beloved, curtailing freedom in every way. (95)Far away somebody was playing a mouth organ; the music slithered over the cane fields and into the pine grove; it spiraled around the tree trunks and mixed itself with the pine scent, so Cholly couldn’t tell the difference between the sound and the odor that hung about the heads of the people. (105)Then they were old. Their bodies honed, their odor sour. Squatting in a cane field, stooping in a cotton field, kneeling by a river bank, they had carried a world on their heads. They had given over the lives of their own children and tendered their grandchildren. With relief they wrapped their heads in rags, and their breasts in flannel; eased their feet into felt. They were through with list and lactation, beyond tears and terror. They alone could walk the roads of Mississippi, the lanes of Georgia, the fields of Alabama unmolested. They were old enough to be irritable when and where they chose, tired enough to look forward to death, disinterested enough to accept the idea of pain while ignoring the presence of pain. They were, if fact and at last, free. And the lives of these old black women were synthesized in their eyes—a puree of tragedy and humor, wickedness and serenity, truth and fantasy. (108-109)He was aware, of course, that something was awry in his life, and all lives, but put the problem where it belonged, at the foot of the Originator of Life. He believed that since decay, vice, filth, and disorder were pervasive, they must be in the Nature of Things. Evil existed because God had created it. He, God, had made a sloven and unforgiveable error in judgment: designing an imperfect universe. Theologians justified the presence of corruption as a means by which men strove, were tested, and triumphed. A triumph of cosmic neatness. But this neatness, the neatness of Dante, was in the orderly sectioning and segregating of all levels of evil and decay. In the world it was not so. The most exquisite-looking ladies sat on toilets, and the most dreadful-looking had pure and holy yearnings. God had done a poor job, and Soaphead suspected that he himself could have done better. It was in fact a pity that the Maker had not sought his counsel. (136-37)Nobody paid us any attention, so we paid very good attention to ourselves. Our limitations were not known to us—not then. Our only handicap was our size; people gave us orders because they were bigger and stronger. So it was with confidence, strengthened by pity and pride, that we decided to change the course of events and alter a human life. (150)And the years folded up like pocket handkerchiefs. (162)We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. (163)Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover’s inward eye. (163)Show more"

Influenced, I am sure, by Faulkner, she tells her stories in fragments, jumping around in time and from one voice to another, creating something that can perhaps only be understood as music: jazz, the blues, or something more dangerous still:
The pieces of Cholly's life could become coherent only in the head of a musician. Only those who talk their talk through the gold of curved metal, or in the touch of black-and-white rectangles and taut skins and strings echoing from wooden corridors, could give true form to his life. Only they would know how to connect the heart of a red watermelon to the asafetida bag to the muscadine to the flashlight on his behind to the fists of money to the lemonade in a Mason jar to a man called Blue and come up with what all of that meant in joy, in pain, in anger, in love, and give it its final pervading ache of freedom.
I find myself wanting to go on quoting, since Morrison's language is so superb, but the story she tells is one of squalor and tragedy. Cholly Breedlove's freedom is that of a man who has nothing. Taken from his mother, rejected by his father, he rattles around for a few years, marries a woman called Pauline, and fathers two children. But marriage does not suit him, he takes to drink, and the Breedloves settle into a relationship of abusive codependency:
If Cholly has stopped drinking, she would never have forgiven Jesus. She needed Cholly's sins desperately. The lower he sank, the wilder and more irresponsible he became, the more splendid she and her task became. In the name of Jesus.
The almost-mute central character of the book, however, is the Breedloves' daughter, Pecola, a charmless child who gets teased at school and is the butt of everybody's jokes. She is convinced that everything would be better if only she had blue eyes like the white girls in her reading primer (the book begins with a stunning deconstruction of a passage from Dick and Jane). The closest she comes to having friends are the whores that live upstairs and the two girls of the MacTeer family, who take her into foster care after Cholly has burned down their apartment. Chloe, the younger of the two, alternates as narrator with Morrison's own omniscient voice. Although also black and poor, she is there as the touchstone of a normal childhood, going to church and school, getting into scrapes, selling marigold seeds to save for a second-hand bicycle. But hers is a curious voice, looking back across a thirty-year gap, the rawness of childhood jostling against the experience of a mature woman, nowhere more startlingly than in her opening lines:
Nuns go by as quiet as lust, and drunken men and sober eyes sing in the lobby of the Greek hotel. Rosemary Villanucci, our next-door friend who lives above her father's café, sits in a 1939 Buick eating bread and butter. She rolls down the window to tell my sister Frieda and me that we can't come in. We stare at her, wanting her bread, but more than that wanting to poke the arrogance out of her eye and smash the pride of ownership that curls her chewing mouth.
Not quite her opening lines, actually. There is a short prelude in which she already reveals the denouement: Pecola became pregnant with her father's child, losing it when it is born too soon.
Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. [...] There is really nothing more to say—except why. But since Why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in How.
And so the story begins, a jazz riff of jangling voices, but not without beauty: beauty in the normal childhood of Chloe and Frieda, even the young love of Pauline and Cholly. Yet hope turns to tragedy. Slipping sideways into her story, Morrison indeed shows us How; the Why we must answer for ourselves.Show more"

Also, technically part of the BookTube #ToniMorrison2020 voxer chat, where we will read Morrison’s novels sequentially, month by month.Morrison’s command of language shines through even in her debut. My rating feels more biased than anything else, regarding what I might personally find moving enough to merit a 5. There’s no denying this is quality literature.Morrison follows a variety of Black characters throughout the early to mid 20th century, largely dealing with poverty, racism and violence. Perhaps there is some archetypal language in describing some groups, like light skinned black women Geraldine, who works hard to distance herself from “negative” Black stereotypes and pours all of her love into caring for her cat. But it’s ridiculous to ignore that there are some trends in cultural behavior, and more to the point, it’s effective as a work of art.The biggest trend Morrison explores is how “white” is seen as the paragon of beauty and how that affects Black children. The main character, Pecola, is consumed by the wish for blue eyes. Her supposed ugliness causes her a lot of harm by family, neighbors and herself.While Pecola turns that inclination inwards, our first person narrator and Pecola’s foster sister Claudia, is able to vent some frustration at these racist ideals. She destroys her white dolls, and otherwise comes from a stable family where she can feel some self worth.Other characters struggle with their place in the world. Pecola’s mother, Mrs. Breedlove, turns to movies and fantasies until her body starts to fall apart on her, a sign that she doesn’t belong in that world. She starts caring for the (beautiful) white family she works for more than her own. Pecola’s father, Cholly, grew up with abandonment, poverty, and a sexual awakening tinged with an act of racism. It turned him angry and violent.I can’t really recount things here that will speak to the power of Morrison’s language. Just pick up the book! Some things people in the voxer chat noted: the similarities between what Morrison is probing, and a James Baldwin speech about realizing how the country he’s been taught to feel patriotism towards doesn’t see him as a full (read: white) citizen. Someone else was haunted by Cholly’s father’s rejection of him, after the bereaved boy traveled by bus to come and find him in another city. One thing that really stood out to me were the scenes between Pecola, Claudia and the prostitutes. Morrison dabbles into various forms of diction befitting of characters with various backgrounds. The scenes with the gregarious prostitutes in particular made me feel like I was in the room with them. And it was nice, in a way, how these “fallen women” were so comfortable in their lives and with their choices. And in a story where Pecola was often on the outs, they did their best for her.Show more"

Waiting to be opened and beckoning me to find Toni Morrison. For some reason, I always thought this book will be all about beauty and sunshine... little did I know that I was right but in the wrong sense. This book is about beauty..it's about waiting for beauty to arrive in some way or the other. For the marigolds to bloom and sunshine to creep into lives. A little girl thinks having blue eyes is the only kind of beautiful. Black lives are trivialised. In fact, so many of us are so privileged that we forget so many lives in this world go waste. Trying to find something to hold on. Trying to make a life and trying to find a life.Her characters make me sad and they live in a sad world. It is fiction but I can't help but wonder about the Pecolas and Claudias of the world. And Morisson gives a voice to these people who will otherwise lead a life that no one else will think about twice. She knows exactly how to write about these things. Her writing is like a dialogue between the reader and the writer. Only the reader can't do much except sigh in frustration and the writer will do anything to bring out the truth of so many lives. Once you read this book, it stays with you for a while. It will take time to digest the truth about lives especially black lives and more importantly, Toni Morrison's truth. The last lines of this book are enough to give one a glimpse into the kind of fight that Morrison takes up on behalf of a race that is still fighting to find their identity.  ""The soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers.

I will explain why I stopped later in this evaluation.Toni Morrison is an incredible writer; her grasp of language and its use is quite exquisite. There times that the story became nearly poetic. She is obviously extremely intelligent and gifted with a phenomenal ability to tell a story. Her ability to grasp and examine human nature at its most basic elements was at times illuminating and at others nauseating. Her characters cover the spectrum of any community and any era. There were times that I played back what I had heard because the picture was so vivid.Loraine, Ohio, every heard of it? No? Most folks haven't. I lived in Ohio and I do remember hearing of it but like most of Ohio, most towns aren't exceptional unless they make national news - by the way, I had a much older brother, who lived and attended THAT SCHOOL that became famous but never mind about that. This story is connected by a thin thread -all the main characters know each other and they all are African Americans barely getting by in the 1970's but truly the timing is not the key relevant factor, it is about surviving. Few have enough money to pay the necessary bills and there never seems to be any left over for even the smallest pleasures unless your daddy likes the licker. I was at a disadvantage because I don't know how many chapters there were. Some stories were significantly longer than others. We start out hearing about Pecola Breedlove, she is pregnant, we don't to much about her but her Mrs. Breedlove works for some white people and seems to like them better than her own family. Mrs. Breedlove's husband is often drunk. There are several other children in the family. Eventually, we find out Pecola has lost the baby. Pecola is nearly obsessed with having blue eyes and blond hair, which she prays for every night. Eventually, she gets a doll with those features which she treats very poorly. The Breedlove's live in an abandoned store and the upstairs has three women residing, who mainly entertain at night.As the story progresses, we hear the story of Pecola's friends, her neighbors and her parents, who grew up in the deep south and how each came to live in Loraine. One of the stories, Pecola is playing with her friends when suddenly blood is running down her legs, she believes she is dying but her friend's mother tells her otherwise with the most limited information and sends her home. Other stories include maiden Aunt Jimmie, who rescues her niece's infant son from a garbage can and raises him as her own kin in Alabama. When she dies, Charles Breedlove now 14 leaves the night following her funeral looking for the man he thinks is his father. When he finds him, he is so intimidated by the situation, he soils himself and runs away. At times, Ms. Morrison gets graphic. It is no mystery when she discusses certain types of meetings between men and women. Frankly, I would skip some of the explicit and detailed telling, I felt like I was listening to porn. It was not necessary to include incorporate this into the story in my opinion. While listening to disc 6, we get a description of Charlie Breedlove's first awareness of his sexual interest in his newly crawling daughter, Pecola. It achieved its goal of making me physically ill. I can't drive under such conditions, nor do I need to visit that place as I have for many years in my dreams. I am not judging Ms. Morrison's inclusion of this very picturesque scene, I just don't think it needed to be quite so graphic.Ms. Morrison is incredibly clever. Her talent has been recognized, perhaps not as much as it should be or could be. Is that a function of the fact that she is a woman? Or a function of her skin tone? Or could it be that she makes people face their own ugliness? All of the above?Show more"

Trata-se de uma das leituras essenciais para compreender sua obra assim como “A Canção de Solomon”, atualmente esgotado, e o clássico “Amada”, que dispensa apresentações.Tendo como cenário a cidade-natal da escritora, Lorain, localizada no estado Ohio, o romance remonta a 1941, ano que os Estados Unidos entraram na Segunda Guerra e ainda sentiam os efeitos nocivos da Grande Depressão. Sua protagonista é Pecola Breedlove, uma menina negra, de onze anos, feia e vulnerável, cujo sofrimento resulta da violência que é exposta.Resumidamente, oriunda de uma família disfuncional, pai alcoólatra e mãe negligente, ela deseja unicamente ser amada e, sem sucesso, seu refúgio passa a ser a fantasia. Pecola acredita que, se tivesse olhos azuis, mudaria tanto a maneira que os outros a veem, como a realidade que é forçada enxergar.Em suma, ela considera que a beleza difundida pela mídia e associada ao padrão estético europeu é o passaporte para alcançar poder, virtude e felicidade. Aliás, o adjetivo “bluest”, do título em inglês, cai feito uma luva, pois além de designar o “azul mais intenso”, também significa “mais triste ou infeliz”, aspecto indissociável à Pecola.Quanto ao gênero, o livro é considerado uma ficção modernista, pois emprega o fluxo de consciência, exibe diferentes pontos de vista e temas correlatos a esta escola, por exemplo, o colapso familiar, a dissolução da comunidade e um crescente ceticismo em relação à religião. Entretanto, sua narrativa também se distingue pela presença de elementos afro-americanos, desde o emprego do dialeto usado pelos negros (Ebonics ou African-American Vernacular English) na edição em inglês até as letras de antigos blues.Marcado por inúmeros diálogos e dividido em prólogo e mais quatro capítulos (Outono, Inverno, Verão e Primavera), “O Olho Mais Azul” exibe uma polifonia de vozes narrativas bastante sofisticada, marcada especialmente por um narrador onisciente, que auxilia na construção da experiência de Pecola, como também pelo testemunho de Cláudia Macteer, uma colega da menina e alterego da escritora, O prólogo foi inspirado numa cartilha de alfabetização muito conhecida, utilizada entre 1930 e 1970 nos Estados Unidos. Os irmãos Dick e Jane, os protagonistas, eram membros de uma família feliz, composta unicamente por pessoas brancas de classe média. Este estereótipo sempre foi muito criticado, à medida que não representa a grande miscigenação que forma o país e, sem dúvida, trata-se de uma contradição num romance que gira ao redor de uma família miserável da comunidade negra. A bem da verdade, esse é um artifício engenhoso utilizado por Morrison, pois, a desconstrução dessa pequena história no parágrafo final, indica o que o leitor terá pela frente, ou seja, a desconstrução identitária de Pecola, conforme seu drama ganha forma.Como todo livro da escritora, “O Olho Mais Azul” não poupa o leitor, pois toca em assuntos difíceis, como o racismo internalizado, abuso infantil e a violência doméstica, inclusive, já houve várias tentativas de proibi-lo em escolas e bibliotecas públicas norte-americanas. Também vale registrar a isenção de juízo, em nenhum momento, justifica-se as ações deste ou daquele personagem, elas são somente expostas, levando o leitor a formar uma opinião.Encerro com Morrison: “Eu amaria escrever sobre os negros sem ter de dizer que são negros. Exatamente como os brancos escrevem sobre os brancos.”Nota: Optei pelo e-book e recomendo.Show more"

Years from now maybe I'll stumble across this place-holder and think, ""I can't believe I never got back to that.""A couple quick notes, random connections, and thoughts:Morrison's quote on 72, reminded me so of a quote I just read from George Saunders. I'll put Morrison's first:""He was aware, of course, that something was awry in his life, and all lives, but put the problem where it belonged, at the foot of the Originator of Life. he believed that since decay, vice, filth, and disorder were pervasive, they must be in the nature of things. Evil existed because God had created it. He, God, had made a sloven and unforgivable error in judgment: designing an imperfect universe. Theologians justified the presence of corruption as a means by which men strove, were tested, and triumphed. A triumph of cosmic neatness. But this neatness, the neatness of Dante, was in the orderly sectioning and segregating of all levels of evil and decay. In the world it was not so. The most exquisite looking ladies sat on toilets, and the most dreadful looking had pure and holy yearnings. God had done a poor job...""And here's the Saunders' quote“I have a sense that God is unfair and preferentially punishes his weak, his dumb, his fat, his lazy. I believe he takes more pleasure in his perfect creatures, and cheers them on like a brainless dad as they run roughshod over the rest of us. He gives us a need for love, and no way to get any. He gives us a desire to be liked, and personal attributes that make us utterly unlikable. Having placed his flawed and needy children in a world of exacting specifications, he deducts the difference between what we have and what we need from our hearts and our self-esteem and our mental health.”...Really, there are two Saunders quotes. Here's the other one:“Maybe the God we see, the God who calls the daily shots, is merely a subGod. Maybe there’s a God above this subGod who’s busy for a few God minutes with something else, and will be right back; and when he gets back will take the subGod by the ear and say: Now look. Look at that fat man. What did he ever do to you? Wasn’t he humble enough? Didn’t he endure enough abuse for a thousand men? Weren’t the simplest tasks hard? Didn’t you sense him craving affection? Were you unaware that his days unraveled as one long bad dream? And maybe as the subGod slinks away, the true God will sweep me up in his arms, saying: My sincere apologies, a mistake has been made. Accept a new birth, as token of my esteem.”There was much injustice in the book. Little injustices - that could have been the name of the book. Little Injustices. I'm talking about buying a torn sofa, the death of the cat, -even the death of the dog: can you imagine living with that? the injustice in believing blue eyes = beauty.Of course, adding them up equates to great injustice. And there were some very, very large injustices perpetrated throughout the book as well. (I think that goes without saying, but I'd better say it just in case.)There was irony throughout the book - I'm looking at you, Breedlove family. And even with such a name, it never felt on the nose.Again. This isn't a review. Just some organizational thoughts before we meet.Show more"

Considering her a new insta-buy, also good thing I have material for days to catch up on. Lucky those who come up last for they will be having those feelings, that joy, in the present 🤣🤷‍♀️Anyway, to the book, I had seen so many reviews out there that left me thinking this book was unreadable, packed with only tragedy, unnecessary details, the darkest of stories, something of that sort... All I saw was truth, life itself, and so many things we need to work on as a society and as human beings.Toni Morrison managed to capture the feelings of so many girls that grow up into a pre-set standard of beauty that society inflicts upon them through all means possible (magazines, television, toys, etc). She helped us understand how a life can bend under the eyes and influence of so many people, the turns our stories can take in the long run, how happiness and hope can wear off with time, how we can let a change of plans consume us, break us, how we ourselves can harm our own to favor strangers, and how we are guilty of misjudging everything more times than not. This book is packed with so much! It also made me think of myself, of my tender years. What if I'd have felt prey of bullying? If I'd have believed everything I was told or made fun of for? What if I'd have never grown out of most insecurities? What if I'd never found a way to love myself as I am? - Most girls don't get to be this lucky, to find a way out of the lies and the constant ""reminders"" of how we should look or what we should strive for... I don't even know how I managed, since everything/everyone around me was trying hard to break me when I was most vulnerable and self-conscious, as a teenage girl. When everyone from schoolmates to family (inadvertently, although you don't know that as a kid/teen) is making fun of your looks, on how you should have a thinner nose, all about the tricks to pinch it several times a day and how they will work so hard to get you plastic surgery someday, on how your skin is such a mess and you are just 10-11 years old, girl you are already doomed!, on how your clothes are all unsuitable rags, even if you couldn't care less about what you have on, and what you're trying to call ""your style"" is just a lack of one, etc. The only thing I do remember throughout all of that is this little voice, that never faltered, telling me how everyone was missing out on how funny, creative, smart and witty this soul of mine was, and thanks heaven for that little voice. I wish no one would ever have the need for it, that voice, that the world was a kinder/safer place, but whilst we work on it I am hoping that voice to scream louder than the outside noise inside all of those girls and boys who are today facing these issues.Someone is trying to make us forget about what is truly important, it is so easy to get caught up in the stuff you can see, so easy to dismiss someone based on looks over brains and personality, most times than not we humans are lazy like that. So let's focus on the health of our inner selves and on improving our relationships with others and the world.There's still so many aspects of this book worth exploring, but I am leaving it at that. I do hope you guys pick this one up and discover those other elements that remain untouched by this already long attempt of a review 😋😅.Show more"

We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father's baby that the marigolds did not grow . . . It never occurred to us that the earth itself might have been unyielding. We had dropped our seeds in our own little plot of black dirt just as Pecola's father had dropped his seeds in his own plot of black dirt. Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. . . Cholly Breedlove is dead; our innocence too. The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too.""Autumn The opening of the narrative is sudden and vibrant, like the first shock of red leaves in late September; at once beautiful and mysterious, and so even more startling. The point of view changes from chapter to chapter, but the main character is always Pecola. More than from her own perspective, her character is given shape by the experiences of the people around her: their poverty, their resentment, their struggle for survival; her ugliness, her unlovable skin, her wretched self-image and subsequent worthlessness. Never are any of these characters justified nor vilified - only dissected and examined. Winter Pecola's life is cold and unforgiving. Each narrative treats her with cool indifference, chilling in how skillfully the author leaves her no pity. She is just one more poor little black girl with an unbecoming family reputation and an ugly demeanor; no sensible stranger would readily bestow on her loving warmth or care. Their affection is reserved for the white and the light-skinned, as they learned to convert their hatred of their own skin into enthusiastic idolatry of the privileged long ago. But Pecola is young and innocent still, too innocent to know what privilege is, why she is lesser for her skin, only knowing the distaste in the gaze of the people who look upon her. Spring Many of them were innocent too, in their youth, if not happy then at least not unhappy. But Pauline withered, her romanticism uprooted and discarded like a weed that did not belong; Cholly crumbled, his despair sprouting like new greenery in the cracks of a sidewalk; and by their touch, they corrupted dear Pecola, preemptively poisoning her, giving her no chance to bloom at all. ""This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture . . . and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live."" The Bluest Eye is that kind of story - one of an unfortunate seedling born in hostile soil. Summer And what becomes of the little seedling that did not sprout? Sadness, for a short while, and maybe guilt - but the memory will pass with the serenity of the breeze after an intense summer storm. The people will use her misfortune to upholster themselves, then forget her. This is not a happy tale. But neither is it unrealistic, and it is powerful in the way it shows the effects of racism, poverty, and discrimination on the underprivileged.Show more"

Morrison did a great job of giving us the back story of most of the characters in this book and showing us how they got to be in the current state that they are. Sometimes our dealings as children end up being our own worst enemies later in life. What we resent most in life is sometimes inflicted upon others to help ease our own pains.

The story was intense and gripping with rich details. A minor example of its fresh language is on Page 77: ""...I had heard too many black and red words about her, seen too many mouths go triangle at the mention of her name..."" (Wish I could write that well!)The book was written from 1965 to 1969 and published in 1970. Her afterword was added in 1993 and covered some of her own critiques, including some changes she wished she had made. The afterword had me thinking more deeply about the book, especially about the opening.The title brought back a memory. In the 50s/early 60s, I attended an all-white elementary school. We were middle-middle class but lived near a wealthy neighborhood, whose families sent their blonde kids to public school. The rich blonde girls in the class were not mean, but they were the bosses and knew it, as did everyone else. The school put on Christmas plays. Only the blondes could be angels. Since my hair had turned brown in 1st grade, I could not be an angel. But my eyes were blue so I was allowed to be a backup angel. I accepted my lot and didn't think much about it. Though now I look back with astonishment.This story is certainly not about real racism that non-whites have to endure. But it's an example of the color hierarchies we all live with -- skin, hair, and eyes. My brown daughters, without ever being mocked, have absorbed this hierarchy from the culture, which I've been trying to counteract for years, including with non-white movies and music. And I tell them I'm proud to be part African (though it doesn't show) and proud of my mulatto great-grandmother in New Orleans. Her pictures are awesome and I wish I'd known her. Her white husband (yes, they married illegally) died just before I was born. So close!Our society has made some progress but we have a long way to go. For example, I'm tired of seeing news anchors with blonde hair and dark roots. Why do they do that? Are they trying to move up the hierarchy and be better than brunettes? I'd like to see them refusing to bleach their hair and, instead, celebrating their own natural color. Would they keep their jobs? (Mine's no longer brown, it's gray, which I celebrate and refuse to dye.)Whoa... that was a long tangent. Back to the book -- it was wonderful and highly recommended!

This was my second time reading this book, and even though I loved it the first time, I loved it even more this time. I just read Morrison's The Source of Self-Regard not too long ago, so now I had some background behind why she crafted this story in the setting of Lorain, Ohio, which was her hometown. I also truly enjoyed reading the author's note at the end, for Morrison felt unhappy with the final product, and felt as if she did not clearly create what she set out to do. I tend to disagree with her, except for maybe the fact that I wish this book had been longer, the stories told a little more in depth. But otherwise, this is a novel that stands the test of time, and is still so painfully relevant. I had forgotten how much the stories and narrators change, but held on to every word even more than I had the first time I read this back in college. I could see so much more of Morrison in every page after reading her speeches and essays, and felt like I understood more of what she was trying to say, and the feelings she was trying to evoke in the reader. These characters are so real, so fragile but ridiculously strong at the same time, trying to overcome the hurdles of their lives while trying to just live. Pecola's story is absolutely heartbreaking, but seeing it told from so many different perspectives helped me to understand how things got so bad and how they ended up the way they did. I found it interesting that the ""main"" narrators are Frieda and Claudia, but as adults, for their story only intertwined with Pecola's and everyone else's very infrequently. But, in the same way, it just showed a town where things happened that everyone knew about, whether they had been present or not. I definitely enjoy Morrison's fiction more than her nonfiction as I've found out, but I'm looking forward to getting more into her work as the years go on.Show more"

Tão sutil quanto verdadeiro. Toni Morrison consegue ser tão sucinta e tão profunda, que o brilhantismo desta obra é a sua dicotomia. Versões distintas de uma só realidade: a sofrida vida de Pecola, ou talvez a da própria autora. Lembrando que T. Morrison foi a primeira escritora negra a ganhar um Nobel, em 1993.Encontra-se longe quem crê que é um livro essencialmente sobre racismo. Vai além, versa sobre a construção de uma sociedade engendrada por arcabouços morais. Vaga pelas vicissitudes da vida. Traz o desconforto de existir, percorrendo as profundezas humanas mais capciosas.Pecola é uma menina negra que é abandonada à própria sorte após seu pai atear fogo na casa em um acesso de raiva e alcoolismo. Logo, o serviço social de Ohio a instala em uma casa onde ela passa a conviver com uma família composta somente por meninas brancas – suas novas “irmãs”. A história é contada por uma destas meninas, Claudia MacTeer, por quem tem profundo apreço, mas que sente pena de sua vida. A inocência de Pecola contrasta com seu maior sonho: ter olhos azuis. “Toda noite, sem falta, ela rezava para ter olhos azuis. Fazia um ano que rezava fervorosamente.” (...) Levaria muito, muito tempo para que uma coisa maravilhosa como aquela acontecesse. Lançada dessa maneira na convicção de que só um milagre poderia socorrê-la, ela jamais conheceria a própria beleza. Veria apenas o que havia para ver: os olhos das outras pessoas.” Em sua convicção, todas as mazelas se resumem a não possuir olhos claros, estigma do culto à beleza. “Além da ideia de amor romântico, foi apresentada a outra – à da beleza física. Provavelmente, as ideias mais destrutivas da história do pensamento humano. Ambas se originaram da inveja, prosperam com a segurança e acabavam em desilusão. Ao igualar beleza física com virtude, despiu a mente, e foi acumulando desprezo por si mesma.”Segunda a escritora no posfácio, o conceito impossível de querer herdar uma característica não congênita foi proposto por ela para que haja reflexão acerca da (pré) condição, ou preconceito, de não pertencer a uma norma de beleza preconcebida. Essa aversão ao feio, à cor da pele, está arraigada na própria escritora. Será que Pecola ou T. Morrison se nutriria do mesmo sentimento se tivesse nascido de olhos azuis?Show more"

I don’t know how I ever forgot because it is the most gorgeous bone chilling narrative of “psychological murder” as Ms. Morrison herself puts it in her introduction. She set out to see what rejection does to a person, and she picked the person most likely to accept such rejection, to internalize it, and you might guess what kind of person this would be. A little black girl in America.“It was their contempt for their own blackness that gave the first insult its teeth.”People far smarter than me have reviewed The Bluest Eye, and so I won’t go on too much. Ms. Morrison gives life to everything. Even the coal stove has a personality. She wanted to write something that was “indisputably black” and she does this with pitch perfect dialect and setting, character and plot. And throughout the book is her immense and unfailing command of heart breakingly beautiful and precise language. “I was physically revolted by and secretly frightened of those round moronic eyes, the pancake face, and orangeworms hair.”I also loved how deep she delves into the characters, the abusive father, the brittle mother, the brutal and brutalized child. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never known anyone like this, if you’d never want to, you know *why* they are, what horrible and mundane combination of circumstances, got them there. It’s characterization at its finest. Ms. Morrison is a genius and the fact that this is her first novel is even more astonishing. “How, I wonder, can it be so neat and nasty at the same time?”It was just recently International Day of the Girl (October 11), and if you know a little girl or were one, this is a book to show just how harrowing it was and still is for many little girls just to survive.

There has been no other author I’ve come across, fiction or non fiction, who gives such an intrinsic view of racism and the meaningless prejudices embedded deep within the minds of society.This novel originated from a conversation Toni Morrison had as a child with her friend who fervently wished for blue eyes. The Bluest Eye was Morrison’s effort to say something to society as a whole. Why would a child pray for something so radical an alteration? Who made her feel so wanting, so negligible, so trifling on the beauty scale? The novel pecks away at the gaze that condemned her. First published in 1965 to a rather lukewarm response, it took 25 years for this novel to get the reception it deserved.The negative reviews of this book all say that there isn’t any hope in this story.Yes. That is completely true. This book is completely bereft of hope. No, not even a faint glimmer.But you tell me.A story of a poor black family in 1940’s Ohio, racism at its rampant peak, a young black girl who fervently prays for blue eyes, bent under the convoluted image of beauty, and finally succumbing to a collapse from the collective trashing of people and circumstances around her.Can there be hope?In the Afterword, Toni Morrison states,""The assertion of racial beauty was not a reaction to the self mocking, humorous critique of cultural/racial foibles common in all groups, but against the damaging internalization of assumptions of immutable inferiority originating in an outside gaze. I focussed, therefore, on how something as grotesque as the demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child, the most vulnerable member: a female.""The Bluest Eye is unforgiving, but necessary; it’s unapologetic, but honest; it’s relentless, but sublime; it’s brutal and yet tender.4.5/5Also, I'd recommend the audio format as it is narrated by Toni Morrison and its brilliant.Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6915394-kristy-miller,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"August 7, 2017",3 likes,0,"In Ms. Morrison's first book, she tells the story of Pecola Breedlove, and her community in pre-World War II Ohio. The story is hard to describe, as it is told from multiple points of view, and gives the background and story of multiple characters. It does focus on Pecola Breedlove, events in her life and her tumultuous family situation. Pecola has known her whole life that she is ugly, and that this is why other people treat her so badly. Her dearest wish in life is to have beautiful blue eyes. We see her life some from her point of view, but also from the point of view of her parents, Pauline and Cholly, her neighbors and friends, Claudia and Frieda McTeer, and a few others in the neighborhood. The main catalyst in the story is a traumatic event in Pecola's life, and how she and those in her life respond to it. This is a hard book, for multiple reasons. It covers hard topics, such as child rape, incest, abuse, self hatred, racism, and mental health. Never easy topics to cover. It is also told with roving/omniscient narration, which I often have trouble with. Often times, a new section would start and I wouldn't be able to figure out who was talking until halfway through, and I would have to go back and re-read it. It's a book that requires effort, and concentration, and it's one that I think I will come back to again.Ms. Morrison wrote this in the late 1960's and it was published in 1970's. Prominent African American authors and thinkers were writing being proud and beautiful African Americans. While uplifting, she didn't want people to forget the struggle and hurt that comes from racism, that comes from children growing up and desperately wanting to be anything else, that comes from believing you are ugly. This is a message that resonates deeply today, as we look for representation in literature, in film, in music, in media, in government. Representation matters.Show more"

Having now read all her novels, it’s interesting what I took away from The Bluest Eye this time around. Aside from the technical aspects (the writing is extremely assured for a debut and her knack for creating a specific time and place is beyond compare) it’s the overarching themes of identity and self-actualization that are present in Morrison’s total body of work that are evident here and serve as a kernel for the main ideas and problems she was interested in solving and writing about.As she proves time and time again, Morrison has the rare gift of making us identify with even the most flawed characters in this book, Cholly and Soaphead Church, while coloring in the environments that have allowed these flawed characters to become so complicated. Yes, this is about Pecola Breedlove and her desperate wish for blue eyes, but this is not her story. Morrison doesn’t even give her her own voice, a deliberate choice that forces the reader to examine the world that we live in and how that world and it’s beauty standards impact generations of other Pecolas. My edition has a foreword by Morrison and it’s interesting to hear how she thought The Bluest Eye was not a success in execution, citing that many readers were “touched, but not moved”. I’ve now read this book twice and I don’t know if I can place my emotional response to the book in either of those categories. Anyways, this is an American classic for good reason. If you haven’t read it (or if it’s been awhile) it’s very worthwhile and still resonates despite being published 50 years ago. I’m sticking with a 4.5/5 rating, simply because Morrison would go on to eclipse herself in future books. First read, August 2015: My first Morrison! She accomplishes so much in 200 pages it's almost scary. What a mind. Looking forward to Sula! 4.5/5Show more"

It begins with a shorty ditty (not sure that is the right word, but has the feel of a nursery rhyme you should know but don't). And this forms a theme throughtout the novel and introduces many characters. For me, it looks at how black have viewed themselves and the idea of beauty. Morrison wants us to be moved and introspective. And I'm not sure how successful this goal will be. After reading, this book, which is so sad and poignant, I still am unsure if I have gone beyond being moved. Beauty is so abritary and yet the infuences she uses make me pause. As a black woman, do I see myself as beautiful? Honestly, not all the time. I would still recommend this book to all women. There is trigger warning: there is sex and sexual violence in this book. It's not graphic or gratuitious. It is part and parcel of what Morrison is trying to state with beauty and worth.Second reviewI’m reading this again almost three years later. Knowing a bit more about the time in which this book is set helps me to better frame the novel. Toni Morrison tackles the weighty topic of beauty. There is a proverb that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But Morrison takes that concept and smashes it with race and gender roles in Lorain Ohio. Pecola is the target for the view on black beauty in 1941. And she is incapacitated by this view- her own self esteem, family, school and wider community. Told from the point of view of a feisty childhood friend, Claudia MacTeer. Claudia is an adult who still tries to grapple with the events in 1941 from autumn to summer 1942. The rating increased as I’m more familiar with literary fiction. But this remains a disturbing narrative which remains quite relevant today. Show more"

And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. All of us - all who know her - felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her.”
The Bluest Eye is a beautifully written account of some of the reprehensible aspects of society. The writing is incisive and raw and makes you see the world with more clarity. This is one of the very few books that has grown with me and made me understand life a little better with every reading. The Bluest Eye centers around Pecola, an 11-year-old girl, who society deemed ‘ugly’ and treated her as such. To mitigate this, all she wanted was blue eyes like the baby dolls. Set in the four seasons, we met Pecola and the people she encounters and their lives - from her mother, Pauline Williams Breedlove, her father Cholly Breedlove to the shopkeeper Mr. Yacobowski who sells her candy but does not see her or even want to touch her and Soaphead Church (Elihue Micah Whitcomb), the misanthropic ‘cinnamon-eyed West Indian’ (Jamaican) charlatan grants her the wish of blue eyes. The Bluest Eye is a commentary on so many things. Picking up this book in my early teens, Toni Morrison gave me the language to understand colorism and its influence on people who are affected by societal norms. In my 20s, Claudia MacTeer’s character taught me that strong opinions and empathy are not mutually exclusive. In my 30s, through the many vignettes of the characters, I learned to remember that everyone we may encounter brings their past experiences with them to the present moment.This book is worth the read, especially love the last two pages. It wraps the sentiment of the book in a concise way.Show more"

She is constantly reminded by everyone around her of how ugly she is. All she really wants though, is to be loved. But who would love an ugly girl like her? With the logic that could only stem from a child's mind combined with society's perception of beauty, Pecola wishes for blue eyes with the hopes that it would solve all her problems.This book tackles important themes of westernized beauty standards and internalized racism. I also thought the writing was quite beautiful and poetic at times. Unfortunately, I wasn't too fond of the disjointed narratives and method of storytelling. Each narrative was like a puzzle piece that the reader has to put together and analyze in order to understand what was going on in Pecola's life. I think the constant change in narratives was meant to exaggerate and highlight Pecola's ugliness and misfortunes, but it only made me feel even more detached from Pecola. The author herself made note of this in the foreward - that the execution of the story, by breaking up the narratives, may not have been the most effective way of delivering Pecola's story. I completely agree with this and can only assume that most of the negative reviews are either associated with the storytelling layout, or with the trigger warnings listed below.

The way she weaves words together is nothing short of magic. Despite her stunning prose, this book is TOUGH. It is tough to read, tough to teach, and tough to write about. The problem, of course, is the rape of Pecola. Rape is never an easy thing to read, teach, or write about, but when it regards a little girl, it is even tougher. In a Morrison novel, rape is never just about a rape. Rape is never the point. If you read this novel and get nothing from it but that a little girl was raped, you have entirely missed the point.I said those words in the class I taught this novel in. There always seems to be at least one student who cannot get past the rape. They think the novel isn't about race or class or gender. When in actual fact, that's exactly what it's about. The rape is a direct result of the racial/gender/class dynamics of the novel. There wouldn't be a rape without all that. To write off Cholly as simply ""crazy"" and that's why he raped his daughter is to excuse his behavior and to excuse society for creating such toxicity and for allowing it to thrive. It's like saying ""boys will be boys."" Cholly isn't crazy. Cholly knew exactly what he was doing.Rant aside, this novel is an important work of literature that is banned because it's uncomfortable. It's tough. It forces people to reckon with white patriarchal social norms that are absolutely toxic to everyone. And it shows the product of such toxicity. And it is a tough book to teach.

From girlhood I loved everything about her. Riveted and mesmerized by her presence in the film, I decided to reread all of her books. I want to immerse myself in all things Toni. That evening I went to my bookshelf only to find that all of my Toni Morrison hardback books were already neatly horizontally stacked waiting for me. I checked my paperbacks and there was the Bluest Eye. I can now begin from the beginning. Halfway through the Bluest Eye the Great One died. I am not ready for her departure. But then again maybe I am. Her work molded me as a young girl. Thrilled me with the idea that I could be seen in the world. There I was boldly represented in the pages of Toni's books. I compulsively read every thing of hers I could find. A seed was planted that maybe one day I could shape words to move people like she did.In my quest I just finished rereading my paperback copy that I purchased for $2.95 as a teenager. It's a masterclass in descriptive writing. It's only 160 pages and I thought I would fly through it, but it is too rich to rush. So many beautifully constructed sentences, that I stopped to take note of, I savored and reread every one. Her words elicited such strong emotions, feelings bubbled up unbidden. My heart broke for poor Pecola who has decided she is ugly. Therefore everyone treats her that way. The story told from the point of view of a ""plain brown girl"", is made just for me.

Then when I read the likes of Toni Morrison I find myself thinking that it's best to leave the job to the talented. Dan Brown, couldn't you have read Toni Morrison at one point in your life and come to the same conclusion? No tree was ever wasted on printing her work.On the surface, the main themes of this book (whiteness as beauty, the tragic consequences of racism and sexual violence, etc.) are not that provocative to any contemporary grown human being with nerve endings. But what I think makes it special is that beyond her great prose, Morrison can still touch on these subjects so thoughtfully. The evil characters and evil acts are humanized without being pardoned. That said, I didn't find myself moved in the same way as when I read ""Beloved"". This book reads and feels more like poetry than narration in most parts (not to sound critical).I should also point out that I read this with my girlfriend, and we took turns reading aloud to each other. I realize this sounds a little saccharine-sweet, but believe me, the sweetness is tempered quite a bit by the fact that we were, in fact, reading about brutal rape and incest and depravity. Still, I thought it was a great book to read aloud if for no other reason than the fact that when I read her words and heard it coming out of my own mouth, I kind of felt smart and articulate.

In that way, Toni Morrison’s writing reminded me of what I love about Joan Didion. Characters are introduced and given meaning through fractured, nonlinear poetic chapters. The Bluest Eye is a story about Pecola Breedlove, an exploration into one family in Loraine Ohio and how beauty and love shaped their story. Through the unique story of the Breedloves, Morrison asks us to reflect on the consequences of our own assumptions and beliefs about love and beauty. The story is nonlinear, because the fractions and elements of life that make up our definitions of beauty and love are nonlinear. They are fragments of moments spanning generations.Every fraction or vignette of a character's story serves to offer a full portrait of Pecola, coaxing the reader into finding ourselves within Pecola. Every word of Morrison’s writing carries so much. It is not a book to be read in one sitting, but a book to be read slowly, with time to process each vignette. All good novels are meticulously plotted and planned, but only in a truly great novel is each word chosen with such tender care.The Bluest Eye was a heartbreaking and eye opening read that will (hopefully) stick with me, forever forcing me to examine my own assumptions about beauty about love and about what it means to love and be loved.

The humanizing of the more villainous characters in the novel, that allowance of their humanity to seep into the pages that would otherwise be stained with the pitying of the victimized, is a feat: one that is done well. In her afterwards, Morrison states, ""One problem was centering: the weight of the novel's inquiry on so delicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing."" Exactly this. The novel is uncomfortable, for it is uncomfortable to bear witness to the duality of human nature; to the duality of ourselves. In forcing the reader to see the ""victimizers, evil-do-ers, and sinners"" as complete beings, she pushes the reader to examine the capacity in all people (even ""good"" people) to commit heinous acts against one another.A gripping, enchanting, and thought-provoking work; Morrison comforts the reader's spirit with her elegant, lyric prose, while simultaneously challenging the mind to look beyond words in order to see the pain, rawness, and perils that come with our conceptions of beauty and the lengths that we will go to to be loved.Show more"

On a weekend in November I read The Bluest Eye.

Pecola and her wish for the bluest eyes is haunting and nerve wrecking. For in a world where we chant be yourself, love yourself, accept yourself, that there is not really any set standard of beauty. A fragile entity of an already oppressed community, a little girl is made to feel ugly by the world. Morrison explores through this work internal racism and the plight of black women in the society of 60s. An already important and relevant work becomes even more brilliant with her poignant writing and beautiful, beautiful descriptions of character and situations. And not overlooking the psyche of the oppressors of Pecola, Morrison ensures that nothing is proclaimed black and white in this world. It's the grey that we also need to accept.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111782-b-sarv,The Bluest Eye,Rating 5 out of 5,"July 14, 2019",2 likes,0,"This is a dual review of two of Toni Morrison’s novels: Sula and The Bluest EyeA few years ago I read Toni Morrison’s novel Tar Baby and I fell in love with her writing. So I was pleased when I picked up her novel Home, a gift from my daughter (see my review for that book at Goodreads www.goodreads.com/review/show/2885585992 ). I enjoyed reading that novel so much, I decided to clear my shelf of the other Morrison novels I had earmarked (or eyemarked?) for reading. To that end I read Sula first and then The Bluest Eye. I’m going to attempt a joint review of these two novels.Both of these novels touch on unique experiences in small communities set in Ohio. Each of them deals with very difficult subject matter. Sula takes a look at the subject of death in great detail, with several characters experiencing death and ending in a mass death at the end of the story. In a frightening passage a little boy drowns while Sula and the other principal character, Nel, stand by – frozen in fear. But there are other passages of murder and death by fire of two people close to Sula as well. In The Bluest Eye, the topic of incest-rape is introduced early and foreshadows the horrible event. Morrison writes the scene, in all of its horrifying detail, and frighteningly captures the state of mind of the rapist. This novel is not for the faint-hearted. Having said so, part of being an adult in the world we live in is learning about trauma that is not our own – experienced through the eyes of others. It is the power of her ability to tell this kind of story that makes Morrison’s writing so moving to me. I am reminded of the James Baldwin quote, “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.” I know I can count on Toni Morrison to bring this realization to mind with her work. I appreciate it for its honesty.I want to share some of my favorite passages from these novels as well, because like Baldwin, Morrison’s turn of a phrase can be compact, magical and profound all at once. In Sula she explains, “The purpose of evil was to survive it and they determined (without ever knowing they had made up their minds to do it) to survive floods, white people, tuberculosis, famine and ignorance.” The beauty in this quote is self-evident. I was drawn to it for this very reason. It is beautiful, it is self-evident, but I had never seen it placed in this light.In describing Sula she says, “In a way, her strangeness, her naiveté, her craving for the other half of her equation was the consequence of an idle imagination. Had she paints, or clay, or knew the discipline of the dance, or strings; had she anything to engage her tremendous curiosity and her gift for metaphor, she might have exchanged the restlessness and preoccupation with whim for an activity that provided her with all she yearned for. And like any artist with no art form, she became dangerous.” And in the end, it was her dangerousness that provided equilibrium in the community. The consequences of this external cause of equilibrium can be seen – but for that you’ll have to read this novel.The Bluest Eye dealt with more than just a child’s rape by her father. In fact, while it is central to the climax and conclusion of the novel – other themes thread into the events surrounding the tragedy of the story. One of the main themes is the impact of white supremacy on the self-concept of beauty. “You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and that they had each accepted it without question. The master had said, “You are ugly people.” They had looked about themselves and saw nothing to contradict the statement; saw, in fact, support for it leaning at them from every billboard, every movie, every glance.” In this passage, Toni Morrison captures with power and subtlety the truth about the way the dominant culture impacts African Americans – which is unfortunately still true today.The futility of the assimilationist perspective is prevalent in modern society. In speaking of the society of the mid-1900s, Morrison shares the following, “They go to land-grant colleges, normal schools, and learn how to do the white-man’s work with refinement: home economist to prepare his food; teacher education to instruct black children in obedience; music to soothe the weary master and entertain his blunted soul. Here they learn the rest of the lesson begun in those soft houses with porch swings and pots of bleeding heart: how to behave. The careful development of thrift, patience, high morals, and good manners. In short, how to get rid of the funkiness. The dreadful funkiness of passion, the funkiness of nature, the funkiness of the wide range of human emotions.”And this message is also powerful, for what else could result in all the misery brought about in the white supremacist society if it were not blunted souls of the oppressor; the suppression of human emotion. It is a menace that Morrison brings out in this passage.Finally, there is the indictment of adults, deadened to the lives of the children around them. The narrator, referring to the reactions to the pregnancy of the raped child says, “….I believe our sorrow was the more intense because nobody else seemed to share it. They were disgusted, amused, shocked, outraged, or even excited by the story. But we listened for the one who would say, “Poor little girl,” or “Poor baby,” but there was only head wagging where those words should have been. We looked for eyes creased with concern, but saw only veils.” And this passage affected me, because I have overheard conversations in my life much like this one: where the child is blamed for the actions of the adult. Toni Morrison writes this truth but many people live it; they are the head wagging people who ought to be ashamed. She captures that attitude so well it is penetrating.And between Sula, and the character of Pecola Breedlove (the victim in this story) one other theme comes out: the need for a community to have a scapegoat. There is a need to have someone to point fingers at and claim some superiority over. It is the way of lifting up oneself by a self-righteous perspective of someone else that is the human characteristic Morrison brings out here.A novel, fiction, is supposed to make you feel. The ability to feel, to connect and move through these stories with all their tragedy, horror and strength, is what makes reading them worthwhile. I recommend them both.Show more"

Pecola lives with her family - her brother Sammy, mother Pauline and drunken father Cholly - in a poor neighbourhood of 1940s Ohio. The past and the present of Pecola’s family intermingle with the stories of her childhood friends, Frieda and Claudia, to provide a thought provoking perspective on internalised racism and poverty.Morrison’s writing is sensitive and poetic, switching between lively dialogue and descriptive narration, so that the stories of her characters are pieced together like a jigsaw. This is a bleak story in many ways, particularly for the inevitability of Pecola’s self loathing and the heartbreaking way she accepts the horrific treatment she receives. A glimmer of positivity is represented by Claudia, who instinctively rebels against the standards of beauty others insist on, but even she learns the wisdom of keeping her rebellion quiet and under the radar.There is a lot packed into this fairly short novel, and it would certainly reward rereading over again.

I wish we (the readers) got to spend more time with Pecola but her community denied us that privilege, since they never saw her except to make themselves feel better. Morrison was very successful in indicting Pecola’s community and by extension, us. We are bystanders while Pecola was getting hurt, and there was not a single thing we can do to prevent the abuse. That begs the question: What can, or would we do, for the Pecolas in our lives??I think Morrison is asking us, in part, these questions:- Do we (parents and adults) deserve the children born into our communities? Are the adults in Pecola’s life worthy of raising her? - What traumas and unresolved generational/personal issues are we passing down to children?- How do we treat THE most vulnerable and marginalized people: young, poor Black girls?- Despite being oppressed, who are we also oppressing?Just a really powerful and tbh life-changing book that I will not be forgetting.Show more"

El experimento que hace Morrison (lo llamo experimento por ser un n=1) muestra las consecuencias de cuando el ser más vulnerable de una sociedad, una niña, aprende desde muy pequeña que es fea y que, para poder encajar, tiene que ser como los demás - blancos - a fin de ser apreciada y querida, rechazando algo que está fuera de su control: su color de piel. Además, Morrison hace una exploración de cómo estos aprendizajes fomentan un endoracismo que busca a la protagonista tener ojos azules, los más azules, para que dejen de verla fea, pero ¿tener ojos azules te hace más bella/o? o ¿es un ideal impuesto?. Me parece que la historia de Pecola merece ser leída a fin de empatizar, mas no comparar, con experiencias que algunos de nosotros nunca viviremos y por lo tanto, al hablar de ellas, solo partimos de un imaginario de cómo son en lugar de leer/escuchar aquellas voces que lo viven en primera persona y en su propia piel.

I am not satisfied with it at all, nor am I touched, only disgusted and disturbed by many things. I believe the subject of internal racism and racial loathing was better handled by Zora Neale Hurston in There Eyes Were Watching God by a single character who wishes to be white more than anything else. That character made me cry. I did not cry for Pecola. I don't appreciate Morrison's observations on the black community here, especially her characterization of black men and that's because most of the men represented were all abhorrent in nature. She also speaks crudely of sex at times to the point it's as if humans are no more than animals and I did not find this poetic, only disturbing. I'm not a fan of this work. I must remind myself it is her first novel, and I must say I enjoyed Sula better. I'll read more of her, but I am surprised by how much I did not like this novel.I believe this subject, internal racism, the hating of one's self could be better explored and has been.Show more"

I was tempted toward a 5, because it’s such a heartbreaking portrait of growing up poor, black, and female and it’s beautiful writing, but the incest and abuse and graphic yet grotesque sex that Morrison always seems to NEED to include make it difficult to give it a full 5.

The way she tells a story is so lyrical, as she has a way of wrapping you in the words and lifting you into another world similar but more intense than your own. For that, the book deserves at least four stars.All that said, this book was a hard read for me. As a woman who’s endured a certain amount of violence and colorism, it hit a little too close to home. The little girl in this story went through more than anyone should ever have to at a young age and her story is nothing short of heartbreaking in every way. I did like that the book shone a light on the pervasiveness of white beauty standards, and the insistence of men and women, black and white, to uphold those standards even in the black community. It also examined the various forms of child abuse and excuses society makes to blame the victims when the community doesn’t understand what’s happened. Really great, but super sad story.

Ya solo que rellene la primera frase de la novela de tanto significado es ❤️ y el planteamiento es tan suyo, tan único como el de sus libros posteriores. Que la protagonista del suceso no sea la de la historia y que ni siquiera tenga voz (y cuando la tiene es consigo misma) es una elección tremenda, así como la disposición de los capítulos.

The character of Pecola was based on a girl Morrison knew growing up who prayed for blue eyes and decided God didn’t exist when he didn’t give them to her. Morrison also said she wrote the book, simply because she wanted to read it. Morrison’s writing is beautiful and gripping. She captures the vulnerability of children perfectly. As well as consequences of adults not communicating with children and the consequences of our pasts. All of the characters in The Bluest Eye are so very human. Even the most vile, horrible characters who we want to envision as real life monsters, Morrison writes them simply for who they are: human. A concept that’s truly hard to wrap ones head around.

There are too many descriptive, repetitive, and boring details about things irrelevant to the story. All sauce; no meat. Plus the author seemed to care more about describing child rape, molestation, and incest as well as sex between adults than the actual development of the characters. I realize tough subjects like rape and incest must be written about but the degree to which they were described in this book was atrocious and unnecessary.

My instinct in describing Morrison’s novels is to note how “hard” they are to read, but this feels almost inappropriate with how little it serves to describe the reading experience. This book is not an Easy Read, rather it, as Morrison almost always does, goes beyond asking and demands that you, the reader, sit with the uncomfortable, the tragic, and the perverse, in order to then witness the high-soaring poetry that she has mastered into a prosaic form. This book has at its center Morrison’s careful and deliberate handling of children and adolescence; the children in her narratives are given a standard of attention and respect typical to adults, while still allowed the pity and sympathy reserved for youth.

Cutting, yet innocent. Written with a sort of reverence for common life and common lives. I liked how the chapter structure started with the back story of a different character every time. In the Afterword Morrison says she does this in part to address that ""the weight of the novel's inquiry on so delicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing."" She feels that she didn't succeed in this because ""many readers remain touched but not moved.""

Although Morrison provides no answers, only contrasting views regarding most themes, her questions about race, gender expectations, class, parental impact, and the effect of one's past are extremely powerful and even necessary to consider now.

Not only dealing with colourism and how beauty was defined in 1940s America, it also examines how love and the lack thereof can define a person. The narrative style has a childish innocence to it which draws you in - abuse and rape is always more tragic seen through the eyes of a child - but what was most interesting about this book was how, for a brief moment, you almost understood a rapist, for a fleeting instant the pedophile was almost human. The characters leap off the page, their virtues and flaws giving them life.This review cannot express how much I loved this book and I am desperate hoping that all of Morrison’s other work is just as strong. For now, here’s some of my favourite quotes :)“Guileless and without vanity, we were still in love with ourselves then. We felt comfortable in our skins, enjoyed the news that our senses released to us, admired our dirt, cultivated our scars, and could not comprehend this unworthiness. Jealousy we understood and thought natural—a desire to have what somebody else had; but envy was a strange, new feeling for us. And all the time we knew that Maureen Peal was not the Enemy and not worthy of such intense hatred. The Thing to fear was the Thing that made her beautiful, and not us.”“Nobody loves the head of a dandelion. Maybe because they are so many, strong, and soon.”“They had extemporized a verse made up of two insults about matters over which the victim had no control; the color of her skin and speculations on the sleeping habits of an adult, wildly fitting in its incoherence. That they themselves were black, or that their own father had similarly relaxed habits was irrelevant. It was their contempt for their own blackness that gave the first insult its teeth. They seemed to have taken all of their smoothly cultivated ignorance, their exquisitely learned self-hatred, their elaborately designed hopelessness and sucked it all up into a fiery cone of scorn that had burned for ages in the hollows of their minds—cooled—and spilled over lips of outrage, consuming whatever was in its path. They danced a macabre ballet around the victim, whom, for their own sake, they were prepared to sacrifice to the flaming pit.”“To find out the truth about how dreams die, one should never take the word of the dreamer.”“Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap.”“He wondered if God looked like that. No. God was a nice old white man, with long white hair, flowing white beard, and little blue eyes that looked sad when people died and mean when they were bad. It must be the devil who looks like that—holding the world in his hands, ready to dash it to the ground and spill the red guts so niggers could eat the sweet, warm insides. If the devil did look like that, Cholly preferred him. He never felt anything thinking about God, but just the idea of the devil excited him. And now the strong, black devil was blotting out the sun and getting ready to split open the world.”“Sullen, irritable, he cultivated his hatred of Darlene. Never did he once consider directing his hatred toward the hunters. Such an emotion would have destroyed him. They were big, white, armed men. He was small, black, helpless. His subconscious knew what his conscious mind did not guess—that hating them would have consumed him, burned him up like a piece of soft coal, leaving only flakes of ash and a question mark of smoke. He was, in time, to discover that hatred of white men—but not now. Not in impotence but later, when the hatred could find sweet expression. For now, he hated the one who had created the situation, the one who bore witness to his failure, his impotence.”“Our manhood was defined by acquisitions. Our womanhood by acquiescence.”“All of our waste which we dumped on her and which she absorbed. And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. All of us—all who knew her—felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even her waking dreams we used—to silence our own nightmares. And she let us, and thereby deserved our contempt.”“Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover’s inward eye.”“And now when I see her searching the garbage—for what? The thing we assassinated? I talk about how I did not plant the seeds too deeply, how it was the fault of the earth, the land, of our town. I even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year. This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live. We are wrong, of course, but it doesn’t matter. It’s too late. At least on the edge of my town, among the garbage and the sunflowers of my town, it’s much, much, much too late.”Show more"

A conversation that continues to this day. Novels like The Bluest Eye are not for our comfort, but for us to see with better clarity the invisible and insidious systems that surround us - as well as the damage left in their path.Show more"

This story is more simple than some of there others, which makes it more accessible and the message more obvious.

Call it the Streisand Effect, but as I tweeted at the time , ""if I hear someone wants a book off the shelves of a school library, I'm more likely to check it out myself. There are books that are beyond the scope of children. But I can't very well know if I don't read myself, too.""Last night I finished reading it. It's not the first book I've read by Morrison; I've also read  Beloved, though it has been some years. I do not recall being overly enamored with it, and in fact, I rated it at one star. I'm not proud of it, especially since I never provided an explanation, but there it is. As I refresh my memory, scrolling through other reviews of the book on Goodreads, I see fives and ones...people really love it, or they really hate it, with one reader calling it 'brilliant' and another just a few reviews lower calling it their ""least favorite book,"" and another saying ""I hated it.""It kind of reminds me of that scene in The Pirates of the Caribbean when Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow is accused of being ""quite possibly the worst pirate I have ever heard of.""""Ah,"" says Sparrow. ""But you have heard of me.""Indeed.And did I just compare Toni Morrison to a movie derived from a Disney amusement park ride? Oy...My point is, it's not hard to see why readers are myopic about her books. Toni Morrison writes with deceptive beauty that yanks at the emotions of anyone with a heart. The imagery of her language is a bright rainbow, a feast for the reader that will allure and entice. It's absolutely beautiful. Like a beautiful meal, the reader can't help but desire to feel and take in the emotions of the story.And what stories.Perhaps this is also why it evokes such negative reactions. The stories are mired in scenes I often cringed to read, depicting abuse, prostitution, rape, and incest, voyeurism, and bestiality. Violence is regular, and references and descriptions of sex are frequent. That they are integrated into such heartbreaking stories, full of pathos and raw emotion only makes me feel conflicted and torn about the value of the novel.Reading The Bluest Eye (and Beloved), it's hard not to believe--and I do believe--that the stories reflect a dark and sordid past of a people in their time oppressed and abused by the laws and majorities of this country, and in turn, they abused and hurt each other. One abuse begets another, and the cycle of pain continues and is passed on. That Morrison dreamed up these stories and crammed them all together into her novels...well. It's a dark imagination, or maybe it's a cautionary note about the past that some might want to forget.To be clear, because perhaps I'm waxing a little contemplative, or maybe I'm overthinking it, or maybe I'm way outside of my bailiwick (after all, I did read a solid four epic fantasy's in the last quarter of 2020 where the worst thing any of the protagonists had to face was a BBEG trying to take over the world, so nothing quite so nuanced or emotional as interpersonal relationships of a historically oppressed people), I do not think this belongs in the junior high library, and maybe not even the high school library. And yes, I recognize I'm a socially conservative personality, and I may be more cautious about what my kids read than many.But don't read this as a suggestion that it shouldn't be read. Maybe there is a place for it in a curriculum when guided by the attentive and careful teacher, a student, especially an older student, might gain some appreciation for its value. Without that guide, I suspect the story is alternately horrifying, confusing, grotesque, and disturbing. And don’t tell me that it “shows the real world,” because this is not the real world as it is for most people today, nor do I think that children—whether young, pre-teen, or adolescents—necessarily are edified or educated by steeping them in scenes that are so dark and depressing.If I had a philosophy of what I think children should read, I think it is not dissimilar to C.S. Lewis's comment here: “Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.” Young readers should be brought along and prepared to face those dragons, prepared to defeat them, then later be brought along to see just how terrible those dragons really are. Whether racism, familial and sexual abuse, misogynism, or even just degrading nature of poverty, there are dragons in this world, and children will one day become adults who face these monsters, or at least they should become such. But the age at which they grapple with these through the writing of Toni Morrison is not lightly and casually approached. They shouldn't be beaten down with those dragons before they have the strength to face them, and then, when they have that strength, they will understand what and why those dragons must and should be slain.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,The Bluest Eye,Rating 5 out of 5,"November 17, 2020",2 likes,0,"Like Morrison, I grew up in Northeast Ohio, so the places in this book are deeply familiar to me. Lorain. The lake. Elyria. Oberlin.And yet— the world Morrison paints is one diametrically opposed to the world of northeastern Ohio that I’m familiar with. So it was incredibly bizarre to me, this juxtaposition of the personally familiar and the strange. And that underscores in a very specific way the extreme division of race and culture in America— that you can live basically down the road from someone and live in an entirely different world. Premise: protagonist Claudia and her sister Frieda, meet a new friend Pecola (with the disturbingly on-point surname of “Breedlove”) whose, at the age of 12, is raped by her father and becomes pregnant with his child. In contrast to Claudia and Frieda’s tough-but-true-loving family, Pecola’s family is deeply dysfunctional— the parents are vicious to one another, her older brother is a budding sociopath, and Pecola is (on a good day) ignored. Ashamed of her own existence, wishing she could disappear from the world, she idolizes the visual opposite of herself: blonde, blue-eyed girls (particularly Shirley Temple), considering them the only form of beauty and thus despairing that she would never have blue eyes. (Narrator Claudia, by contrast, is deliciously sadistic, and prefers to maim the blonde babydolls she’s given as gifts, and fantasize about doing the same to their real-life counterparts). It’s a fantastic examination of the construct of beauty. And, more generally, as always, Morrison’s writing is b e a u t i f u l and immersive.She doesn’t just write “I was sick and my mother took care of me.” No. She gives you the full experience of being sick, of the tough love of worried yet bracing parents. The sight, smell, visceral feeling of being sick and being taken care of. “It takes a long time for my body to heat its place in the bed. Once I have generated a silhouette of warmth, I dare not move, for this a cold place one-half inch in any direction. In an hour or two my mother comes. Her hands are large and rough, and when she rubs the Vicks salve on my chest, I am rigid with pain… but was it really like that? As painful as I remember? Only mildly. Or rather, it was a productive and fructifying pain. Love, thick and dark as Alaga syrup, eased up into that cracked window. I could smell it— taste it— sweet, musty, with an edge of wintergreen in its base— everywhere in that house. It stuck, along with my tongue, to the frosted windowpanes. It coated my chest, along with the salve, and when the flannel came undone in my sleep, the clear, sharp curves of air outlined its presence on my throat. And in the night, when my coughing was dry and tough, feet padded into the room, hands repinned the flannel, readjusted the quilt, and rested a moment on my forehead. So when I think of autumn, I think of somebody with hands who does not want me to die.”Goddamn. Right? Goddamn. Also she’s FUNNY. I’ve read a good amount of Morrison novels but this one seemed funnier than most. Laughed out loud a few times at the dialogue. “He ever been married to anybody?” “No.” “How come? Somebody cut it off?” Boy classmate, during a fight: “You want a fat lip?” Claudia: “Yeah. Gimme one of yours.” Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"January 12, 2019",2 likes,0,"Toni Morrison is not only a good storyteller, she excels at deconstructing the nexus of race, color, class, and identity. Moreover, in The Bluest Eye, Morrison thoroughly delves into how these elements can make us value (or devalue) ourselves and others, both at interpersonal and societal levels. This introspection is most clearly exemplified with the character Pecola. She is the daughter of poor parents, and her whole family is considered ugly in the eyes of her community. Pecola is painfully aware of how everyone in town looks down on her. She wants to be valued the way white, blonde, blue-eyed little girls are, and she longs to have the bluest eyes. When the young girl endures horrific trauma, she further internalizes her shame. This is not unlike her mother before her, which demonstrates the generational nature of this tragedy. “Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap” (121).Much of this tale is told from the perspective of Claudia. In many ways Claudia is also an underdog being a young black girl growing up in post-Depression era Lorain, Ohio. She has to beware of bullies, including the popular and light skinned Maureen. Claudia does not consider herself especially exceptional, but she does have the support of a loving family and stable household. All too often in life, especially in America where the construct of the rugged individual is so deeply ingrained in the national psyche, we tend to compare ourselves to those doing better than us. We are the underdogs of our own stories. And in the Bluest Eye I think the reader is supposed to identify with Claudia, I know I certainly did. She is what we would consider a typical underdog, protagonist to be. The kid has her struggles, but given her support system, she still has a sense of agency and self-assured identity, as shown with her rejection of the blue-eyed dolls. Still, even those struggling to feel valued can themselves derive value (inwardly and outwardly) from those deemed valueless. Despite being one of the few in her community who sympathizes with Pecola and her plight, Claudia falls in line with society’s condemnation.“We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor… We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength” (205). The tragedy is that while Claudia struggles, she is able to be an underdog because Pecola is a pariah. Claudia compares herself upwards, but still benefits from the same superficially derived superiority that she resents when imposed on her in turn. This narrative is dark, but I think an important self-reflection when making sense of trauma, identity, and the human condition. Overall, this is an amazing book and I definitely recommend it. If you are interested in reading about similar themes in a modern context, I would also recommend Push by Sapphire, the book adapted into the Oscar nominated film Precious.Show more"

This was my first book by Toni Morrison and also Toni Morrison's first book (published in 1970; received Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993). I came across this infographic last year:and decided to set a goal of reading at least one Toni Morrison novel in 2023. Not sure why I picked this one--maybe the title piqued my curiosity? How does one write a review for this book?? I 100% agree the level of ""Craft"" of writing is unlike anything I've read. The electronic edition that I read included a foreword by the author in which she simultaneously explains and questions her use of narrative. This was the first time I heard the phrase ""psychological murder"" and it has really stuck with me. I didn't quite understand the opening ""Dick and Jane"" prologue...but after finishing the book, I went back and read it and it made much more sense. Also in the prologue, the author tells you what's going to happen:Quiet as it's kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father's baby that the marigolds did not grow. ... We had dropped our seeds in our own little plot of black dirt just as Pecola's father had dropped his seeds in his own plot of black dirt. ... The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too.The following pages describe how this all came to pass. We will never fully understand the ""why"". In uncovering the ""how"", the author asks us to reflect on what is ugliness and what is beauty. All humans can identify with feelings of being disliked or even rejected, and when a young Black girl is reminded, over and over, how unlikable she is, her vulnerability leads to collapse of her character. She believes that if someone could magically transform her eyes into blue eyes, she would be worthy of love. This was not an easy read. It was painful, sad, and depressing. It did not instill a sense of hope. But the honesty and creativity of presentation left an impression on me that makes me glad I read it, and I would recommend it to others who wish to better understand the themes presented, as well as anyone wanting to read one of the most banned books in America. The American Library Association (ALA) placed it on the Top Ten Most Challenged Books Lists for 2006 (5), 2014 (4), 2013 (2), and 2020 (9). Ultimately, it became the 34th-most banned book in the United States 1990–1999, the 15th-most banned book 2000–2009, and the 10th-most banned book 2010-2019.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,The Bluest Eye,Rating 4 out of 5,"March 5, 2021",2 likes,0,"The futile wishes of small, powerless thingsToni Morrison burst on the literary scene in 1970 with her first novel, ‘The Bluest Eye’. Like many first novels, it draws from autobiographical material, in this case, a little girl and her sister in World War II era Lorain, Ohio. What Morrison depicts in very minute terms is how it feels to be a little black girl in a low-income neighborhood just emerging from the Depression. The novel’s depiction of racial prejudice and deprivation is portrayed through the focus on the most powerless members of the most poverty-stricken segment of society, its children. The opening and conclusion are narrated by Claudia McTeer, a nine-year old who runs around and plays and argues with her ten-year old sister Frieda. When their mother decides to take in an even more impoverished eleven-year old girl, Pecola Breedlove (a very ironic surname), they put aside their trivial squabbles and lavish attention on the quiet, traumatized little girl who, though a year and two years older, seems even more timid and unsure of her footing in a rough world than either of the McTeer girls.Much is made out of the Breedlove’s ugliness, as if that is one more insult to injury:‘Except for the father, Cholly, whose ugliness (the result of despair, dissipation, and violence directed toward petty things and weak people) was behavior, the rest of the family—Mrs. Breedlove, Sammy Breedlove, and Pecola Breedlove—wore their ugliness, put it on, so to speak, although it did not belong to them.”Pecola had been living with her brother Sammy, mother Pauline, and father, Cholly, a drunken, abusive, frequently out of work factory worker who beats his wife and children when he’s not too drunk to pass out in an oblivious stupor. Sammy has run away multiple times and Pecola cowers in a frightened state. After Cholly burns their house one night and is taken to jail, Pecola is taken by social workers to stay temporarily with Claudia’s family. Claudia and Frieda observe Pecola drinking milk from a Shirley Temple cup. While Claudia hates Shirley and mostly cares about little white girl dolls only to the extent that she can dismember them as if to somehow find the much-valued beauty in them, Pecola loves little blue-eyed white girls and utters the wish to someday be granted blue eyes like them, bluer than any of the rest. Only then will she not feel ugly. Much of the novel is seen through the child Claudia’s point of view. She and her sister don’t understand what is happening when Pecola suddently starts bleeding between her legs. They also don’t truly absorb that their boarder, Mr. Henry, likes both the company of prostitutes (when Claudia and Frieda walk in on them he says they’re from his Bible study group) but Claudia finds Frieda crying and finds out that Mr. Henry has fondled her breasts. They tell their parents, who wait for him to come back and then threaten him with a rifle. They wonder if Frieda will be “ruined” as their mother told them the prostitutes were. Because they are at the cusp of awareness of some harsh realities, we can observe this behavior from a position of objective innocence.Morrison proceeds to delve into the back stories of both of Pecola’s parents. He mother impaled her foot on a nail when she was a girl and walks with a limp from then on. The perception of ugliness is imparted to her self-concept early on until she meets Cholly. His background is then revealed. Unsurprisingly, he was abandoned by his parents, thrown into a trash heap by his mother, then rescued and raised by his aunt. His first sexual experience was tainted when some white hunters came across him and a girl in the act and forced him to continue. Cholly internalized their hatred. Unable to direct it back against them, he lashed out at the girl, which set the pattern for how he related to black females of any age from then on.By presenting the back stories for Pecola’s parents, Morrison has presented an origin of their behavior and has traced how repressed hostility gets misdirected from black men and women to anything less powerful than they are, namely, their children. When Cholly comes home drunk in the afternoon to find his daughter washing dishes:‘he became aware that he was uncomfortable; next he felt the discomfort dissolve into pleasure. The sequence of his emotions was revulsion, guilt, pity, then love. His revulsion was a reaction to her young, helpless hopeless presence…She was a child—unburdened—why wasn’t she happy? The clear statement of her misery was an accusation. He wanted to break her neck—but tenderly.” At this point in the novel, Morrison switches the scene to a West Indian immigrant named Elihu Micah Whitcomb who, after pursuing the ministry and psychiatry has abandoned his studies and fashioned himself into a Reader, Adviser, and Interpreter of Dreams named Soaphead Church. He is actually a misanthrope who hates human touch except the flesh of young girls. At this point, Pecola comes to him and asks him to give her blue eyes. He persuades her to feed his landlady’s dog, which she does, unaware that he has poisoned its food. The dog dies and Pecola runs away. This character’s sequence is, in my view, an unnecessary and unconvincing plot device. We understand what led to Pecola’s parents becoming what they were, but this external character appears to be brought on merely as a plot device to further deceive and debase Pecola, although he proudly states in a letter to God that he did not molest her but actually bestowed on her if not the actuality of blue eyes, then at least the belief that she did have blue eyes.Claudia and Frieda learn that Pecola has been impregnated by her father. They don’t understand the incestuous taboo that this act has flaunted and, unlike the others in the town, they want her baby to live, going so far as to plant some marigolds and offering a prayer that the baby will live. The baby has a stillbirth, Cholly dies in a workhouse, and Pecola is taken by her mother to the edge of town. Pecola is thoroughly delusional now, walking flapping invisible wings, now immune from any of the ugliness that the world has dumped on her. She may have received Love of a sort but Claudia concludes that, ‘Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly.”‘The Bluest Eye’ is an outstanding first novel. This is the work of an author who is already in command of her fictional tools and bears none of the marks of a novice. However, I think I have to agree with Morrison in her afterword, written many years later, that it was ultimately flawed by her decision to “break the narrative into parts that had to be reassembled by the reader…many readers remain touched but not moved.” I am not exactly sure what she feels the difference is between being touched and moved but I think that the construction of the novel, circulating around Pecola, and told largely through a child’s point of view, keeps us detached from really feeling what Pecola feels. It is perhaps that difference between being touched but not moved as we would be inside Pecola’s head. The conclusion reflects the author’s own assessment rather than something a nine-year old would make although a grown person such as Morrison, who may have been a child much like Claudia at one time could and is presenting this adult retrospective view. There are so many things that she does in this novel that are right and powerful that the weaknesses do not invalidate the impact the novel has for any reader interested in the work of Toni Morrison.Show more"

Sometimes she lives with other families as her family struggles.Pecola is universally considered an ugly child. Pecola wants nothing more than to have blue eyes like Shirley Temple because she is convinced that blue eyes would make her pretty.The narrative goes round and round and moves back and forth in time, often re-telling certain aspects of the story from different perspectives that fill in the gaps as the reader proceeds.

The Handmaid's Tale

Jim Crow era life for African-Americans was its own dystopia.In 
The Handmaid's Tale
, the rules are enforced by religious elite (or, elite that twist religion to serve themselves). In 
The Bluest Eye
, the rules are enforced by a mostly unseen white society (white characters, even the mention of white characters take up only a few minutes of this 7 hour audiobook). White culture sets the standard of beauty for black culture (as demonstrated by Shirley Temple and Pecola's envy), it sets the rules about where black people can live, where they go to school, how long they can go to school before they have to leave to work, what types of jobs they can have and more.

Graphic depictions of incest, r*pe, sexual assault, racism, death, child abuse, and paedophilia. Themes/mentions of miscarriage and alcohol abuse. What fascinates me the most about this novel is the beautiful writing. Every single sentence in this book sings. Morrison is a master of words, each sentence flowing perfectly into the next. You can feel how considered every word is, nothing seems out of place or pointless—even the most mundane description is bought to life through beautiful sustained metaphors and lyrical prose. Morrison tells the story of one young Black girl through the voices of those around her, each narrative being interwoven to create an intricate web of stories. She speaks on beauty and specifically its intersection with race. A lot of traumatic experiences are woven into the book, which are handled brilliantly by Morrison. The depictions are not sugarcoated, forcing readers to sit with their own discomfort and uneasiness. Some readers perceive their own discomfort or disgust as a reason to dislike the book - while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I would argue books are not always intended to be comfortable. It is books that make us feel uncomfortable or unsettled that often make us think the most. If you are reading a book about a child who is abused and you dislike feeling uncomfortable, I'm not sure what to say to you. I would argue the children experiencing that feel a lot more uncomfortable, and we must face the reality of these situations if we hope to do something about them. Morrison herself addresses the extreme nature of the trauma her main character experiences, saying that 'in trying to dramatize the devastation that even casual racial contempt can cause, I chose a unique situation, not a representative one. The extremity of Pecola's case stemmed from a crippled and crippling family - unlike the average black family and unlike the narrator's. But singular as Pecola's life was, I believed some aspects of her woundability were lodged in all young girls.'Morrison fictionalises a heightened, individual experience in order to speak on the universal experience of young girls. Morrison hopes that readers will not ease into the 'comfort of pitying [Pecola] rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.' I certainly feel I am walking away from this novel with a lot of self-reflection to do. This book is as brilliant as it is disturbing. It is an unsettling yet beautiful read, full of heart and commanding of attention.Show more"

Her long life was a gift to literature and to arts. That her death comes after two days of media coverage surrounding back to back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton makes a kind of literary sense in that Toni Morrison was ever a critic of our culture and the often banal cruelty inflicted on minorities, women, and children. In The Bluest Eye, Morrison set out to detail and chronicle the destruction of innocence in the literal break down of Pecola, a twelve year old girl who, by the end of the novel, has suffered cruelties minor and grievous resulting in her complete psychotic break. And the language Morrison uses to describe this degradation, its smooth flow and lyrical beauty can make you forget that you are reading something abjectly terrible.“Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion.” ― Toni Morrison, The Bluest EyeWhen you pick up a Toni Morrison novel you better be ready for your heart to break in ways you didn't know existed. That the Bluest Eye was the first such novel in a series of ever sharpening craft, that she was actually disappointed in later years at her inability to create a more seamless piece of art, is a testament to the growth and skill she acquired as she toiled at this work. And Morrison was ever sure of herself and the place in the literary universe where her novels lived. I once saw a interview an Australian morning show did with her where the journalist asked Toni if she would ever consider writing books about white characters. Toni looked this woman dead in the eye for an uncomfortable amount of silence for TV purposes and asked if the journalist had any idea how racist such a question was? That such a voice has left the literary world is no question a loss, but we can be grateful for the body of work she leaves behind. Show more"

Toni Morison has a way of portraying culture and identity with language in a way that we seldom see. In our lifetimes, we’ll only see perhaps a handful of author’s who are not only good with words, but are using their work to give representation to those who need it and doing it in a way that is pioneering. This was an emotionally difficult read. It hits at childhood rape, absent parents, alcoholism, poverty, racism (including internalized racism), and sexism.The overall theme showing how our society teaches black children to see themselves and their counterparts as ugly for their blackness was poignant, to a chilling degree. Parts of this novel made me very uncomfortable to the point where I was convinced I didn’t like it at times (Cholly and Soaphead Church were especially hard to read, for example).Digesting that this was her first novel and reading her forward really helped me see the full perspective. This is one where you’re doing yourself a disservice not to read the foreword. I liked that she mentioned that she wasn’t satisfied that the disjointed perspectives made “many readers touched, but not moved.” That was to some extent how I felt. Perhaps it was my ADHD, but I had trouble digging into the feelings of each character because the story would shift to a new perspective by the time I was easing into one. That said, I love when authors don’t follow the typical formula we’re all accustomed to and acknowledge that we all put far too many expectations on new authors and the weight of those expectations is even heavier for the pioneers, women, and POC. Toni was a new black female author when this was published in 1970. I choose to critique it as if I was reading it then. In which case, this was wildly adept use of a novel to weave a tragic story with beautiful, literary language interspersed with authentic colloquialisms and AAVE to give us a glimpse at the African American experience. Definitely made me eager to read more of her work.I’ll leave you with my favorite lines: “This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live.”Show more"

This is not the first book I am reading from her, but this is her first book, the debut novel. I would not have picked this one, out of all her books to read, if not for one of my classes` assignments. I mean, I still have Beloved on my “Currently Reading” shelf. I did not need this one.What I am trying to get at is that I was acquainted with her writing style and the subjects she approaches—and I knew that I would not be prepared for it, no matter how much I would brace for it. The subjects that she tackles are…powerful.
And it hit me straight in the guts.
The book is disturbing. It shows Morrison`s skill in writing and it foreshadows the powerful voice that she would unleash upon the American literary field through the decades that followed (this book was published in `70). But, god dammit.It is a book written in the third person, following two or more perspectives, but the one perspective that predominates the narration is that of a black girl.
   “A little black girl who wanted to rise out of the pit of her blackness and see the world with blue eyes.”
Her story can be summed up in the following line: she lives in a violent world. And I am not saying it lightly. The causality in which that violence is displayed makes it threefold worse.I mean, it was 1970 in the US. You did not have to create Star Wars-like scenarios to put in scene the struggle of black girls. The bad guys were as Darth Vader-ish as possible. Believe me (and if you don`t, read the book, but don`t say you weren`t warned)

The themes in this book were tragic yet very real, and to see people comment about it using tragedy as shock value really missed the mark. I also just don’t agree with the comments saying the disjointed narrative wasn’t compelling or didn’t work (even tho Toni Morrison says the same). I would argue that it is never to serve as some sort of “apologist story”, or explain why the pedophiles do what they do and the rapist acts how he does, but rather highlights how these tragedies are systemic and historical within black and brown bodies. I don’t think it takes one backstory to give a rapist or pedophile any sympathy, and the point of such a backstory (to ME at least) is to convey the lineage and ancestry of white idolization and black hatred. I found Claudia’s POV to be interesting in how we don’t realize up until the end she may have been an untrustworthy narrative all along. Only when she realizes what happened to Pecola does she admit her own wrongdoings throughout and how that skewed her perception of Pecola. Pecola ☹️. I’ve seen lots of mixed reviews and thoughts about her, and while I don’t agree with most I can see how their concerns are valid. I mean, Toni Morrison writes in her forward that this story was meant to showcase a “unique situation, not a representative one” in how the “demonization of a race” and idolaztion of another might affect “the most delicate member of society: a child; the most vulnerable member: a female.” Morrison also explicitly states how she explored “social and domestic aggression that could cause a child to literally fall apart.”From the start, Pecola was a device to showcase something grander, and the reviews complaining about her individuality being robbed were so close yet so wrong. It was never about seeing a POV from Pecola for empathy, because you find that for her regardless. To take from Claudia, “public fact becomes private reality…”I felt Pecola’s experience was obviously not meant to be universal nor the standard, but there was truth and reality in her story and wounds.Heartbreaking read 😭 10/10This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

Perhaps it wasn't inspired the way Pecola's imaginations did, with the pretty blue-eyed dolls she saw young children play with or the classmates who were the most popular in the schoolyard, but growing up with Disney princesses like Cinderella and Shirley Temple movies, I was often resigned to dress up as less ideal characters; there was even a school performance where all the blondes were made Shirley Temples in pretty white dresses and blue ribbons in there curled hair and those who did not fit that mold ended up as Pinocchios with brown overalls. Immediately, The Bluest Eye spoke to a deep-seated grudge I had with the way society forces young girls to conform to a standard that is out of their control from birth. “You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.”Morrison explores the way we normalise what should be beautiful and cherished in society. She examines how cultural expectations and beliefs create opportunities for others and clearly relegates others, in this case, the black community, to conform and struggle to be valued and sometimes even just recognised. Some people are able to work around it, but the most vulnerable few, sadly, can never fight the shame and trauma. Her writing is beautiful in this debut novel and the message is powerful and clear. However, I did struggle to fully connect with the characters and plot. And while the novel had so many of the right elements, I was just not as invested as I hoped to be. For me, this sits at around a 3.75 stars. But, again, I need to emphasise that the themes of this novel and Morrison's writing make it absolutely worth reading.Show more"

My heart breaks for Pecola, it breaks for those who want to help her but are too immature to do so, it breaks for all the little boys and girls who hate themselves because they believe Black is to be hated and dirty. It breaks for the adults they become who bring their childhood traumas to adulthood and make those traumas their legacy. My heart breaks for those who are angry and take it out on the innocent - it’s unfair to the innocent, preventable by the angry. My heart breaks for those who had no one to help them, who looked in the mirror and hated what they saw, who were blamed for the acts of ignorant adults and horrible human beings. Ms. Morrison did a wonderful job of making Pecola’s plight pitiful for herself and inducing anger at those around her. How could people speak to or treat a child like that? All she needed was a hug and some love. I know the world has a long way to go but it gave me hope after reading this story to walk into a bookstore and find dozens and dozens of children’s books about ethnically and culturally diverse children, classes, genders, and careers. More and more children are going to grow up understanding that Black is beautiful, Asian eyes that kiss in the corners are beautiful, girls are scientists, a physically disabled individual can play sports, and adoptees are family. The blondes and blue-eyed whites are beautiful too. The differences help make the world go round.Rate Procedure:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - I loved the book so much I would reread it again and would recommend to a friend.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Thoroughly enjoyed the book, could not put it down, would recommend to a friend, but do not need to read again.⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Probably a good book that I enjoyed but there was something about it I did not love (e.g. The writing style, the POV, etc.).

It feels like I am fangirling - I see Toni Morrison, I give 5 stars. But this book was once again so good!Toni Morrison weaves magic with her words. Something about her writing just pulls you in to the scene immediately. The first time I came across Toni Morrison was when I was listening to an audio version of this book. I was in about 15 minutes and I knew I had to stop and get the actual book and read it in order to properly savour it. I am very glad that I did that. Some of her descriptions had me going back again and again. This was especially strong in the first chapter and later in her chapters featuring Pauline and Cholly Breedlove.The version I read comes with a Foreword and Afterword by the author. She says her aim was for people not to pity Pecola, but to question their own participation in the culture that allowed her to be brought down the way she was. She feels she hasn't achieved this, but I think I disagree. By making us hear the stories of not just Pecola but also the people surrounding her who were the direct instruments that brought her misery, we get to know about the whole environment and the toxicity that pervaded it. The same racial elements still exist and multiple other beauty standards have been added on. This book does make you question them and allows you introspect your participation in these things (if the general debate on body positivity hasn't already made you, that is).There are some missteps. This novel isn't as tightly knit as her other works. There were moments where I felt like she was telling us about the characters instead of just showing us. Surrounded as it is by text that really works, these stick out a little. I also found the final chapter to be in a different note. It did not have the same texture and tonality that the preceding ones had. Of course, these things don't take away from my 5-star rating or just how good this book is. A definite must-read.Show more"

When I discovered her writing, I felt a whole new world was opened to me, a world I had never experienced or knew. Yes, I knew about black history- more than most as a history major who focused in black and women's studies, but this was different. This was a novel that made history real, a social historian's dream. Additionally, the writing was like nothing I'd ever read- lush, melodic, powerful. The Bluest Eye was my first Morrison book, and since then, I've read most, but not all, of her other novels. 2021 is the year I am re-reading or reading ALL of Morrison's work, beginning with The Bluest Eye, which I had not read for at least 3 decades. I found a book called The Toni Morrison Book Club, a discussion of The Bluest Eye, Beloved, A Mercy and Song of Solomon, so each month, starting in January, I'll be revisiting one of Morrison's book, beginning with the four in this book. I couldn't wait to get started, so I began with my first introduction to Morrison as a way to close 2020. The book did not disappoint on its second read. I always recommended this book to my students as the first book to read if you haven't read Morrison yet. Pecola will always stay in my heart, and remind me to be kind, to be compassionate, to make a difference in the lives of children who don't have anyone else to love them, support them, and see the beauty in them. One thing I had forgotten about this book is Morrison's genius in writing dialogue and monologue. The rant that Claudia and Felicia's mother goes on when she discovered the girls drank all the milk made me smiles in a book that does not give you much to smile about- and will resonate with every child, or mother, who has ever gone off on their children over a transgression. The whole book is just perfect, and it's hard to believe this is Morrison's first novel. Can't wait to re-read all of her works in 2021.Show more"

They always seemed to be there plus the book was written way before I was born so I might as well get to it when providence will allow me. I vaguely remember picking this book when I was either 17 or 21 or both ages, my memory is a bit fuzzy, and then abandoning it after a few pages, I couldn't recall the reasons why I did that but now after finishing it I have my suspicions.Toni is a talented author, her prose paints a picture rich in color and in vistas but the story is wanting. Initially I was on board with her idea of portraying life lived in poverty as grim and an antithesis to human dignity, I have always been suspicious of writers who romanticize poverty, but as the book progressed and we are served more of the same ghoulish stuff in graphic detail and to what end? There was no clear answer to that question. This is where she lost me, I consigned her to those writers who traffic in the macabre and crass whose shock factor scares readers into searching for alien themes in those stories. I would like to believe human nature is diverse and what she presents is a card board cutout when a 3-D model was needed. May be am wrong. I intend to read Song of Solomon to see if there is a pattern here but...My views of the book aside, I respected Toni as a person and was glad that in her life time she got the credit she deserved. She inspired generations of authors especially black women who are now making a name for themselves. Tayari Jones comes to mind and her moving tribute of Toni in Time Magazine was personal, inspiring and divine. Our native son Binyavanga Wainaina did not get the same treatment and it has been a sore point for me lately. He was the other author whose watch ended this year and prodded me to read his works. I hope that privately he had personal satisfaction and later generations will vindicate him.Our time on this earth is simultaneously short and long. We do what we can with the hand we are dealt and hope that we leave a mark on this pale blue dot. That we lived, that our days were not wasted in mindless paper pushing drudgery and the never ending descending staircase of consumerism... We lived.

I mean, how do you get somebody to love you?”We find ourselves grappling with that question everyday, especially dark-skinned Black girls who are reminded everyday why they aren't worthy of love and adoration. Reminded everyday why they are the standard or the desirable. As a dark-skinned Black woman myself, I've seen what that can do to someone. I've seen what can happen if there's no one around you to tell you, remind you that you are beautiful in every way. Pecola, unfortunately, was left to wither out in the sun. Watching the downward spiral of Pecola, especially at the age she was, was like watching your younger sister suffer in silence. It felt like I trapped in a glass-box. I saw everything that was going on. Everything that was effecting her and belittling her. I saw everything that was making her feel like she would never be beautiful and yet I couldn't save her. I couldn't protect her from the harsh winter, the boiling summer, soft autumn or the delicate spring. All I wanted to do was reach out and let her know that she was enough. She was everything I'd hoped she'd be. My sweetest dream. My biggest wish. The warmth of a thousand suns and the cool breeze of the wind. She's love and passion. Anger and sorrow. Pain and redemption. Kindness and grace. She's all the things. She's beauty. However, this isn't just Pecola's story. This is a story of generational trauma. This is a story of European beauty standards forcing its way into the homes of those who never fit the mold and setting them ablaze with doubt and insecurity. This is a story of loved ones battling their own demons without realizing the repercussions. This is about a girl who wanted to be good enough. A girl who wanted to be beautiful.

Morrison tells this allegory with a focus on a deprived girl, Pecola, who is so ashamed of her blackness that she wishes for blue eyes. Pecola, a young black girl who is the victim of incestual rape, perhaps is the most disadvantaged possible, or, as Morrison puts it in her foreword, “the one least likely to withstand such damaging forces [of contempt and self-loathing] because of youth, gender, and race.” Because of Pecola’s extreme psychological damage, her passivity renders her so weak that she doesn’t have enough to drive the story as the main character. Resultantly, her story and the steps that lead to her plight are told through the lenses of those in her life. With “The Bluest Eye,” Morrison delves into the reclamation of racial beauty and the struggles non-whites faced when seeing beauty as something unique to one race. Morrison’s finely selected language tells a multi-faceted story of depth, although I found it a bit distant at times. Pecola’s story is told in an almost dehumanized way that made me feel pity for her, but not be deeply moved. Morrison admitted some dissatisfaction with her solution to telling the story of such a vulnerable character through narrative blocks that must be recombined by the reader. However, her story-telling is powerful and extends well beyond Pecola. While there are many quotable portions of this book, the final paragraph is one of the most poignant and all-reaching. I’ll leave it out of this review to avoid spoiling the narrative, but I highly recommend reading this novel or one of Morrison’s others.Show more"

Her words are gorgeous magic woven together with the far-too often ugly truth and when those two come together it truly creates art. The Bluest Eye is a story of internalized racism, as well as structural racism, and their terrible consequenses. It's also Morrison's debut novel, something that I'm completely amazed by.Pecola Breedlove is a girl who more than anything wishes to have blue eyes, to be as the white girls everyone thinks are so pretty. She wishes to be just like all other eleven-year old girls. Instead, she is stuck with two abusive parents and a brother who leaves her alone with them more times than not. I'd like to put out a triggerwarning for abuse, animal abuse, incest, pedophilia and rape. This is a tough book to read, one that was prettily written but then leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. There is much to unpack, but Morrison does an incredible job of showing how self-hate and european/white beauty standards can deeply penetrate all aspects of a life, carving it out and infecting it to the core as well as how it can manifest as generational trauma. Even if the writing sucks you in and flows easily, it's an extremely heavy book, but one that should be read. “You looked at them and wondered why the were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question. The mast had said, ""You are ugly people."" They had looked about themselves and saw nothing to contradict the statement; saw, in fact, support for it leaning at them from every billboard, every movie, every glance. ""Yes,"" they had said. ""You are right.” I truly adored The Bluest Eye, as well as the other book by Toni Morrison I've read, God Help the Child, that has a similiar theme.

As a sidenote, you know people get you when they ask what you are reading rather than what you are watching (books >> tv). I noted I am usually reading some Stephen King book (just look at my Goodreads) but I’m currently reading a Toni Morrison book.Now, Stephen King is my favorite author. And I will defend him as a legitimately great writer against the cultural snobs who discount him from their ivory towers (I want to describe them as “hoity-toity” but wasn’t sure how to work them into that sentence). That said, Stephen King’s books are pretty straightforward - he spins a good yarn that quickly draws you in. I told this to my friend, comparing it to Toni Morrison whose books are a bit more demanding. I’m not sure, but I imagine, since she won a Pulitzer or two, that she is more accepted by the cultural snobs. I’m not really trying to compare these two authors, other than to note that they are both excellent in their own way. My friend has also read a few of Morrison books. He described this one as “brutal” which I think is accurate. It is not a comfortable or fun story. The subject matter is tough - incest, abuse, racism. Morrison’s books hit you on two levels - first just as well-written stories with interesting characters, but also on deeper levels as you think about real world issues of racism, sexism and so on. To me, this is one of the marks of a great author. I’ve read three of Morrison’s books. I think Song of Solomon was my favorite, though as I think back the story of Beloved is more fixed in my memory. I imagine this one will stick with me as well. Sometimes the book that is most engaging while you’re reading it is not the one that sticks with you…Overall, a fantastic book.Show more"

Nonetheless, Toni Morrison is an insanely skilled writer (nameless girl praises Nobel Prize winner for her writing skills, I know I know), but wow! Her prose is the kind that reminds me why writing is such a beautiful and unique form of art. I often had to reread sentences just to grasp the ingenuity behind them; the creativity it required to string together such a unique combination of words and spin it into something so impactful. Plot wise, check trigger warnings because this was terribly upsetting and shocking, but also eye opening and educational. The only qualm I had was that, because the story was introduced from Claudia’s POV and remained so for half the novel, it was quite jarring when the voice suddenly switched to a third person narration of Pauline, Cholly, Pecola, and Soaphead Church's backstories, in turn making me less invested. I know this is primarily Pecola’s story, but then having Claudia introduce the story and remain the only first person POV was an interesting choice, but maybe I just don't get it (this is why I need English class).Show more"

As with all her books, The Bluest Eye explores so much - the internalization of beauty standards and racial self-loathing, the way that domestic and societal aggressions can systematically build upon each other, how an entire society can fail a child. What I liked most about this book was Morrison’s assertion that acts of self-hatred, neglect, brutality, and violence rarely occur in isolation. She provides the context of what might happen to a person throughout their formative years - psychologically, physically, emotionally - to shape them into the person they are. My edition had an afterword and reading it made me even more in awe of Morrison’s brilliance and her powerful ability to wield language. Reading her books reaffirms my belief that words and books can change our views and change society.Quotes I collected that I literally want to print out and build a shrine with and worship:- “There is really nothing more to say—except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.”- “Being a minority in both caste and class, we moved about anyway on the hem of life, struggling to consolidate our weaknesses and hang on, or to creep singly up into the major folds of the garment.”- “…it was the fault of the earth, the land, of our town. I even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year. This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live.

Even with this being her first novel, you can witness so many brilliant nuggets strewn throughout the text. I do think she has some better literature in her repertoire, but I do not think even Morrison would disagree with that; after all, she's noted in post that she might have done differently.The Bluest Eye is not told with the most linear timeline, but she really just utilizes this structure to be able to tell stories across multiple generations. I think this works fine, but I would have just liked some more concrete pronouns/introductions at the start of each chapter so we automatically know who she's referring to. The ambiguity made the past and present somewhat muddled at times, and I found myself having to reread to decode different sections. Other than this, I thought there were many mournful moments, but it was all fairly well done. The characters are flawed, but the text makes its self-awareness pretty clear generally. The themes of intersectionality and guilt/blame are integrated in big and small ways as all of the characters both undergo trauma and implement more severe trauma to those in lesser positions of power within the community. This is a message that continues to resonate even in the present.I would highly recommend reading this with the knowledge of potential triggers.

Aside from acknowledging her general reputation as a masterful writer and having seen Beloved on film awhile back, I had no idea what to expect.The Bluest Eye is a story about a young black girl who has been convinced by the world around her that she is ugly. It's also a story about racism, poverty, rape, bullying, misogyny, violence, sociology and American history. But above all else, it's about the resultant deep shame of self-identifying as ugly. And the effects of that shame at the individual and societal levels. This book is serious, at times shocking, and filled with sadness. It's as relevant today as ever.Having read mostly non-fiction and historical fiction lately, Toni Morrison's writing style was a breath of fresh air. It was interesting to perceive pure writing talent, similar to watching a star athlete or listening to renowned musician.

Toni Morrison calls this novel a ""psychological murder"" -- the murdering of self-esteem due to hatred for physical characteristics we cannot control. In this book, Toni Morrison shows us how fragile the ego and self-esteem of children are. This is a highly complex novel that tells a story of a little black girl at the intersection of race, class, color and gender. She is seen as the ugliest little girl because of her dark skin and features. It's heartbreaking. In between this story, there are various other stories about the lineage of slavery, trauma, oppression and growth. It heavily speaks to racism in the United States and worldwide colorism. The lyricism of the words evoke a deep and beautiful melancholy. I say beautiful melancholy because I can appreciate the description of her deep longing for connection. Because after all, it's what we as humans long for. We all long for being loved and connected. p.s. I feel like I have to sit with this book a little longer and process it all.

We put pepper in the feet of our stockings, Vaseline on our faces, and stared through dark icebox mornings at four stewed prunes, slippery lumps of oatmeal, and cocoa with a roof of skin.Hoewel Toni Morrison (1931-2019) haar debuutroman The Bluest Eye deels schreef vanuit de ogen van de negenjarige Claudia, is het beeld dat zij schetst van een zwarte gemeenschap toch behoorlijk ongepolijst. Centraal staat Pecola, een meisje dat als pleegkind terechtkomt in de familie van Claudia nadat ze door haar vader is verkracht. Morrison omschrijft Pecola als het lelijke eendje, dat mede onder invloed van haar omgeving zelf is gaan geloven dat ze ‘ugly’ is. Het meisje is ervan overtuigd dat haar leven anders zou zijn als ze blauwe ogen had, een eigenschap die voor haar overeenkomt met ‘wit zijn’.De keuze om het verhaal deels vanuit het wereldbeeld van een jong zwart meisje te schrijven pakt goed uit. Morrison gebruikt daarbij ogenschijnlijk absurde kopjes die uit de Amerikaanse kinderserie Dick and Jane blijken te komen. Verder schrijft Morrison vanuit de alwetende verteller en gaat ze mede in op de levenswandel van Pecola's ouders. Dat leidt ertoe dat de lezer zich ondanks alles toch kan inleven in vader Cholly, zelf immers ook een kind van de rekening. Ten slotte ontsluit Morrison de pikorden binnen de gemeenschap, waarin een wittere huid voor meer beschaving lijkt te staan.Ik vond het een indrukwekkend boek, al was het verhaal af en toe wat warrig en had het soms zelfs wat weg van een ‘tafereel’ zonder specifiek doel. EnglishIn The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison intertwines the view of a nine-year-old black girl with the harsh daily life of her community, creating an abrasive contrast.

But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.""Devastating and horrifying. There is not much to say about The Bluest Eye that hasn't been said already. It's crude and discomforting and it confronts the effects of deeply internalized racism while never allowing the reader for a moment to look away from exactly how the perpetrators become what they are, from exactly how a little black girl comes to see her own inferiority as not only existent but legitimate. The concept of looking, and seeing, is key in this tale and it's the key of its reading process too. By writing from multiple perspectives, including, often, those of the abusers and the perpetrators, Morrison allows the reader to see the twisted system of marginalization as it is, as it comes to be, with all its cycles. And you don't get to look away. You don't get to unsee. There is no comfort here, no silver lining.

Her writing is beyond beautiful, her story is absolutely heartbreaking. It's of no wonder why she won a Nobel Prize or why she's considered one of the last ""classic"" authors of our time. The Bluest Eye is not only a powerful and poignant story (sadly still relevant today), but it's also a masterful approach to narrative and structure. I've read many saying it made them feel disconnected from our main character, having all these other voices and characters in the foreground, but I believe this elevated the story and made it that much more purposeful. The racist response to Pecola's blackness and therefore ""ugliness"" is not a one time thing performed by one racist individual, it's the result of many internalized and externalized racist notions within a society. Ones that are still affecting Black girls and women today. Morrison's decision to have all these stories intertwined with Pecola's merely exemplifies the many factors and people that go into the desctruction and deterrence of an innocent Black girl then and now. While I am disappointed with myself that I didn't pick up, or even cared very much about, any of her work before, I don't believe I would have had the necessary tools and maturity to fully understand it. I am excited to delve into it in the future knowing very well that she may shortly become one of my favorite authors...Show more"

I read this with a bookclub organized by our local BLM chapter. The writing is absolutely beautiful, and the dialogue jumps off the page.The book begins by laying out the main characters as they are now, and later goes into detail about the experiences that lead each character to who they are today. I think, because of that, this book needs to be reread to be fully appreciated.The book explores the negative effects of whiteness as the beauty ideal and the internalized racism Black characters both experience and perpetuate. The book felt to me like a call-in, a conversation among Black folks. I was definitely not the target audience, and so I kind of feel uncomfortable talking about it or critiquing it. Because of this, I'm not giving this book a star rating.TW: Child sexual assault.

Danmark var lidt for dansk, og vores accent bar præg af arrogance, snobberi og stive forklæder. Det samme år udkommer Toni Morrisons første roman The Bluest Eye på den anden side af jorden og repræsenterer et komplekst sammensurium af identiteter og sociale lag, men også en verden, hvor enderne ikke mødes. Imens vi i Danmark løfter debatten til et niveau svarende til en stillingtagen om, hvorvidt det er sundt for små piger at lege med barbiedukker, så skriver Morrison om drømmen om at få de mest blå øjne i hele verden. Raceundertrykkelse og overlevelse, forfald og strategi bliver romanens tunge omdrejningspunkter. Morrison skriver ikke bare efter hjertet, men søger harmoni og sammenhæng i alle lag af sine fortællinger. Dette er første forsøg, og det bliver en lidt rodet affære. Integrering af de mange lag og drømme lykkes ikke helt, og romanen bliver fragmentarisk og opdelt, fordi det ikke lykkes at finde en løsning. Til gengæld er det en smuk, sørgelig og indholdsrig fortælling. Set i omtalte tidslomme, så ryster den vores grundvold og bliver også af samtiden kasseret. Idag kan vi dog se kvaliteterne og sværhedsgraden i at skrive om raceproblematikker med en raceneutral pen, mens de blå blå øjne brænder sig fast på nethinden.Show more"

This isn't a book. It is an experience.It is a book that requires digesting.Morrison tells the story of poor Pecola, set upon, a tragic little girl with a damaged mother and a vicious, abused father, Polly, and Cholly in a series of stories that intertwine. Pecola comes to live with another family with two feistier, funnier little girls. This somehow makes her even more tragic. Morrison shows how chance encounters affect the characters' view of themselves growing up, and how this in turn hurts their children. She uses language that no one else dares use and is critical of the way that some African-Americans have willingly enabled a racist culture that holds their own children back while prioritizing others.Sexual abuse is another central theme. I can't help but think that this is in part autobiographical. I loved it but hated it too. It made me so angry and so sad, but I am glad I gave it my time.

The Bluest Eye is written predominantly from the perspective of a child, or as an external narrator looking back on when she thought like a child. The weaving together of different temporal settings and different internal narrators is done skillfully, and the diversity of voices within the book allows for a sense of multiple lenses, broader perception. I read a version that included an afterword written by the author decades after the original publication, and in that afterword she spoke to her initial purpose in writing the book. I found that to be a really illuminating commentary, wherein she explicitly speaks to the internalized self-hatred that a racist America imbues to its people of color.There were certain aspects of the book that may have felt disjointed, particularly when Morrison switches narrators or picks up a different thread of the picture. However, the overall structure of the book is coherent when viewed as held together around these central questions of beauty and goodness. The way that she incorporated a breadth of experience spoke to the ranges of abuses that a racist society perpetuates, and it provides important recognition that the larger abuses would not be sustained without the smaller ones.

The Bluest Eye was a new one for me. Somehow I've never read it until now. I made the decision to listen to the audiobook with Morrison as the narrator. This was both a good and bad decision. Hearing her authentic voice for all of the various characters was simply beautiful, and wrapped me into the story at every turn. On the other hand, her writing is so rich and poetic that sometimes it was easy to get lost in the narrative, and I often wished for the chance to flip back and read a few pages earlier. This is not easy to do with an audiobook. The Bluest Eye is a difficult read, in that the subject matter is troublesome and unsettling at best, and deeply disturbing at many points. But Morrison's prose is pure poetry, so that even the darkest points are intimate and hauntingly believable. What other writer can go so deeply into the mind of a man committing incest to make you feel his emotions, pain, and motivations? The experience of this book takes time to simmer in the soul and mind.

There were times I was voracious for the next sentences and other times I had to put the book down and fill my cup in some trivial and simple way because the emotional toll and violent imagery became too much. Morrison adequately summarized it in the afterword of the edition I read: “… this is a terrible story about things one would rather not know anything about.” But these types of stories need to be told. My heart aches for Pecola and her parents and her parents’ parents. I really appreciated the diverse home lives present in this story that weaved together and helped tell the tragedy of Pecola Breedlove. We are so lucky to have novels written by Toni Morrison. My only regret is that I never read this in an academic setting with the opportunity to discuss this horrific story and the poetic telling of it. Another great summation shared at the end of the novel: “Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover's inward eye.” Show more"

AND IT WAS WRITTEN OVER 50 YEARS AGO. It’s so heartbreaking and gut-wrenching and encompasses so many regular, uncommon, and destructive aspects of living under racism. Morrison in providing narrations from the point of view of children of different backgrounds, shows how some children can persevere through hardship when having adequate support systems and how without support others crumble. Brilliantly, she does so without making victims stereotypically ashamed and without villainizing those who perpetrate violence. Essentially every character in the book is complex makes mistakes in their thinking and behavior, but all suffer in experiencing racism. Some suffer independently, while other pass their experience onto others and their family. Extremely thought provoking and still very insightful today. The only thing is there’s quite a lot of descriptions of sexual violence that one might need to take breaks in between reading, could become very triggering, but the violence is not glorified by any means in my opinion so I’d still push through and read it if you can manage.

Writing more accessibly than ever, Morrison's lyrical prose take on touches of themes she would spend her career exploring. She unearths generational traumas born of American racism, specifically through sexual violence. She utilizes magical realism to crystallize her narratives. There is so much here on the American ethos, racism, beauty, otherness, and self/internalized hatred. We get to see here the revelatory genesis of a vital American literary career that binds the embers of the Harlem Renaissance to the tradition of Faulkner and Woolf and to post-modern literary movements. It's as rich of a text as any Toni Morrison. She doesn't miss. Simply, it is the story of Pecola Breedlove; a young Black girl who desperately yearns to have the blue eyes of her white doll. She is only granted this wish after her father rapes her. The narrative is nonlinear, told through fragmented pieces and vignettes that tell the story of Pecola and all the lives that touched hers. Reading The Bluest Eye is like watching a spool unravel, learning the traumas and stories of an individual, a family, a community. Morrison traces the lines of trauma with a gentle hand.Show more"

The book came highly recommended by a book group and librarians. I took the books description at face value, it was about a young black girl growing up in a world where blonde hair and blue eyes was the definition of beauty. I assumed it would talk of the issues she faced (it does in great detail) and possibly how she overcame those obstacles by discovering beauty isn’t defined in blonde hair and blue eyes. For the majority of the book I was sad, which I believe is the point - to feel for the character and the terrible life journey she was on. But I was also revolted at the overly sexualized encounters (the woman with the cat on her lap! What the heck was that!?) but what made me turn off the audiobook and give up was a child rape that was written in pornographic detail.

Morrison's Bluest Eye is fascinating, disjointed, and impactful. Following these small black children in Ohio, I felt immediately transported and immersed. The majority of the women and men in their lives emotionally stunted, cruel, and broken. This novel holds a mirror up to the most insecure inner thoughts that so many black people have experienced as a result of the abuse done to them and the unattainable beauty standards set for them by society and held up by those close to them. It showcases the ignorance and naivety children, but also the clear understanding of being different, rejected, and isolated as a result. Its devastating. And yet in the same vein, Morrison is also able to include moments of humor in an otherwise somber narrative. My only gripe with this story is the jump from characters and perspectives.

They had looked about themselves and saw nothing to contradict the statement; saw, in fact, support for it leaning at them from every billboard, every movie, every glance. ""Yes,"" they had said. ""You are right."" And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it.Filled with the disadvantages of being born a certain way, an emotional exploration of how one little girl can be so shaped by the world around her, her very perception of herself and her worth is changed.Show more"

Eventually I got the hang of it and had no trouble following the narrative, but time jumps sure did not make it easy. My biggest problem with the novel are some of the characters - I just couldn't like them even when their backgrounds are revealed and you should feel some kind of pity for them. There's so much negativity, so much self-destruction... and while the story did remind me of tales about poor Europeans form the turn of the 19th century and their lack of education, opportunities, and self-determination, somehow I had trouble empathising even with children. Some are downright hellish creatures bent on torture of animals and other people alike. So big 'NO' for me. Yet the central point of the book holds firm and I can only applaud Morrison for pointing out internalised racism among the black population of America.I also believe there are several cultural and historical references going over my head since I'm not American, so naturally my overall impression of the novel can't be elevated with knowledge I don't have.

The story is, quite simply, messed up beyond belief, and it lends an acrid taste to every sentence of this book.

Through several different voices, Morrison shows how inequality and racism of blacks in America reverberates in a myriad of intensely painful ways, causing black people to not see themselves as beautiful, to reject themselves, and to then turn that rejection into anger for themselves and towards each other. This is Morrison's first book, published in 1970. I loved this book, but it was very difficult to experience through reading, leaving me feeling grateful that I did not have to live it. No one should have to. As part of my reading to educate myself more on race, I wanted to read a literary African American classic. It felt so satisfying to read Morrison's artful prose and masterful articulation of the destructive impact of racism. I had been feeling that as we, as a society, become awakened in the Black Lives Matter movement, we must ask for more than an end to police brutality. This book, with the BLM movement, pushes me to believe that we must examine all kinds of inequity in our country. We must strive to elevate ourselves above the compulsion to feel better about ourselves by pushing down our neighbors. Morrison illustrates the damage done when we succumb to this urge.Show more"

Imagine a narrator with the voice of a child as young as Scout Finch, but with innocence replaced with naïveté and then quickly warped by trauma into rage or madness. With this voice the story is told. Recent events brought me back to The Bluest Eye. Enough time has passed for my own soul to heal; I could read and learn, rather than read and (only) cry. Morrison uses a modern story telling style, somewhat disjointed but constructed to ease one into the story as both participant and observer. She examines concepts of beauty corrupted by racism and the cyclical impact of abandonment and lovelessness. Some scenes are brutally mature, but appropriate for the weighty content.

However, I did not really felt touched by the story, and its format was, to me, hard to follow. The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison's first novel, tells the story of Pecola, a black 11 years old girl whose life has been defined by her ugliness - according to the white-centric society standards - and a dreadful event that involves a member of her own family. In this work of just over 200 pages, Morrison explores (or tries to) the beauty standards that the fundamentally racist society has set, and how these affect the black community, whose members are last on the ""beauty scale"" that Western cultures have accepted. I think the premise was perfect and extremely interesing, but for me it was not explored nearly enough. With that being said, I understand that the story is mainly told through the point of view of a little girl, and thus does not dwell on the brutal racism behind these beauty canons, but unfortunately this was to me precisely the weakness of the whole book. Even so, I deeply appreciate this work because it has probably sparked the beginning of an extremely needed conversation on beauty, racism, social pressures, inspiring many works, stories, and studies to come.Show more"

Once we knew, our guilt was relieved only by fights and mutual accusations about who was to blame. For years I thought my sister was right: it was my fault. I had planted them too far down in the earth. It never occurred to either of us that the earth itself might have been unyielding.”The Bluest Eye is a powerful and disturbing novel that vividly captures the devastating effects of racism, particularly internalized racism and colorism. Morrison’s language is rich and evocative; certain scenes—Pecola’s conversation with the prostitutes, the girls encountering Mrs. Breedlove at work, Claudia destroying the baby doll, the final dialogue—imprinted themselves on my mind. Her exploration of generational trauma is similarly moving. The structure is brilliant: It weaves in and out of different perspectives, through which Morrison paints a complex portrait of several families via a handful of well-chosen scenes, and it allows Morrison to describe the context around Pecola’s family while still offering a close-up view of Pecola’s experiences.But those same structural choices kept Pecola at a distance. I felt horror and pity reading about her pain, but Morrison didn’t allow us to observe much of her inner world beyond a few key traumas. And while there was symbolism in the book, it was at times less subtle than I expected; the observations toggled between extremely sharp and a bit didactic.I loved the afterword, written by Morrison 23 years after initial publication. It was a fascinating look into her reflections on what worked and what (to her mind) didn’t. She is an exceedingly harsh but insightful self-critic. I was tempted to reread the book, informed by the afterword, and do a more thoughtful job picking it apart.Show more"

I don't for a moment question her talent or ability, she's an amazing writer. But some of her stuff is hard to get through. Set in Lorain, Ohio, this is about grinding poverty, child abuse, racism, and coming of age. Or at least, that's that I was getting from it. The book is formatted a bit oddly, which occasionally threw me off. The two things that struck me as a bit odd were that some of the chapters started with what seemed like one of those ""See Jane Run"" books (which sometimes seemed relevant and sometimes didn't), and that frequently we'd meet a character, and then in a later chapter, suddenly get their life story. Sometimes, that was a bit jarring. A very well written book, but do NOT read this if you're at all depressed/having emotional problems. Show more"

I saw this one while shelving books in the school library and remembered a store in Atlanta that had book-scented candles, and one was named The Bluest Eye. It was a nice candle. Sweet. But this book is not sweet, and I hadn’t expected it to be so dark because I started reading it with only the knowledge of Toni Morrison’s popularity and a candle I liked the smell of. Reading the afterword, I realize Toni Morrison wanted this book’s darkness to be somewhat concealed, so that you don’t realize just how disturbing it is until you’re already reading it. Morrison states, “I know (and the reader does not — he or she has to wait for the second sentence) that this is a terrible story about things one would rather not know anything about.” Accurate. My appreciation for Morrison’s excellent writing battled it out with the revulsion and sadness I felt while reading it. My reflection on the book lands in the middle, hence the 3-star rating.

Perhaps, even heavier reading it as a young Black woman who sympathizes with characters navigating a world surrounded by whiteness & Eurocentric beauty. Pecola is the main character longing for the bluest of eyes: a characteristic that indicates true beauty. But she’s not the only character influenced by these warped perceptions. Nearly every character in this story grapples with their Blackness & feeds into the narrative that darker skin is the epitome of ugly; it’s hinted that Pecola has the darkest skin & several folks (friends, family, neighbors) flat out call her ugly or treat her differently because of it. They reckon that her ugliness is what’s brought so many hardships & traumas into her life. It’s heartbreaking to read how one false truth has spanned these generations.

My sister-in-love and I read it together, in celebration of the life of Toni Morrison who passed away this summer. While published in 1970 and telling of a post-depression America (1940s), it was profoundly daunting thinking about how many of the themes of this book are relevant today. In addition to the ignorance in which we define beauty (which has been severely heightened due to social media, body shaming, filters, etc.), this book calls us out on how most of us tend to use the misfortune of others to place ourselves on pedestals, leading to self-hatred, thus resulting in so many other unintentional consequences. In this case, bullying, rape, incest, hypocrisy, neglect, abandonment, abuse (verbal, physical, emotional, etc.), mental illness, and the list goes on. Despite the heinous acts Ms. Morrison writes about with such great details that readers have a sensory response to the stories, she has a beautiful way of exposing the humanity of those we want to hate, causing us to feel sympathy for them as well. We, as a people, country, and world, have so much healing to do, and unfortunately, as in this book, it is our children, the most innocent, who suffer from our issues the most.Show more"

Toni Morrison's use of graphic vocabulary and sticking detail allows the reader to really picture the message that she is attempting to put across. It felt as though I was being transported to that place in that time period even though I had not even been born yet. It is not a book to read for younger individuals as the emotion passed through all the characters and the pain would not be understood. Writing it in this ominous third person helped me understand everything going on instead of if it were reported through the main character.

I am happy to report that Morrison’s first work was not like this at all–it was easy to understand and accessible to read. And absolutely gut wrenching. Thematically this is a difficult read at times. While not necessarily a main character, this novel centers around a young Black girl, Pecola, and the traumas of her life. The easy-to-read writing style of Morrison at times makes her story even more of a gut punch but I could not put this down. I was left gooped and gagged and wanting to tell everyone to read this. My absolute favorite thing about Morrison’s writing and what I expect I’ll also find in her other novels is the empathy and craft with which she creates her characters and tells their stories. While not excusing any actions throughout the book, Morrison provides back story, context, and the traumas of the lives of even her most hated characters. She really excels at creating the depth of a character as if they are a real person and shows how those experiences have made them into the people you find in the novel. At its core, this novel explores society’s skewed definition of “beauty” and how that is often paralleled with whiteness. Morrison writes this narrative with masterful nuance; I’m sure I did not pick up on everything throughout this novel but I didn’t need to; it’s a phenomenal read regardless of how much you “pick up on.” The only aspect that upsets me is that of all the mediocre novels written by dead white men that I read for school, not once was Morrison part of the lists of required reading.

I think a lot of it went over my head but for the stuff that didn’t, it was too depressing to really hit me (in the sense that I had some protective wall up and didn’t let it). There were excellent moments when I was tempted to read past my bedtime, fully immersed in the book. Then there were moments where reading felt more like a chore, moments I think the book would be better without (or to have them refashioned). But all in all I will think about this one for a long time.

At times the story details grueling human experiences. To anyone interested in reading this book I will provide you with trigger warnings for assault, abuse, and death. The books is equally beautiful as it is dark. It is raw with its story and blunt with the reality of the black experience.

Pecola, the main character is a “young, ugly black girl” who dreams, begs and prays for blue eyes so she “can be beautiful.” It’s a very sad story, it’s VERY hard to read some times, and yet unfortunately this is not a fiction story for so many people. (Check the content/trigger warnings ahead of time.) Some of the r*pe scenes were written almost in a romance novel sort of way which was very off putting, although I believe was intentional to provoke those feelings. Again, a lot to unpack here. Ultimately, lost a star because the audio book narration was unfortunately a bit off cadence and also the story line and narration within the book was also a bit disconnected (see others reviews and authors notes herself).

I was really a kid when I read Jazz and found Morrison amusing and funny a bit. I don't believe I can say this for The Bluest Eye. It wasn't amusing but annihilating! To think that one lived or continues to live the misery and suffering of the central character, a child, in this text is devastating. One thing I gathered from reading Morrison is that she's not shy. She stands face-to-face with the racial pain of her people while they get killed, raped, violated and harassed, and gently asks you to see it for yourself. There is no barrier in her writing. If such horrible things have happened to people in our history, what's the shame in talking about it, and holding the evil inflicting this atrocity on them accountable for it? Show more"

The way Morrison portrays the background of the characters that surround Pecola is a literary resource interesting and leads to a global view of the motifs that moves them.

Una obra cruda, perfectamente bien escrita, narrada a dos voces que nos deja ver las consecuencias de la exclusión social, el racismo, las ideas de inferioridad y los cánones de belleza idealizados en Pécola, una niña afrodescendiente que sueña con tener los ojos azules. Una historia escrita hace 50 años que sigue terriblemente vigente, en tanto que como sociedades y en lo individual seguimos en dinámicas divisorias de nosotros contra ellos; Si tú eres peor, entonces yo soy mejor, si observo la maldad en ti entonces me enorgullezco de mi bondad. Más allá de que la obra es muy intensa emocionalmente, que está escrita bellamente; La llamada a la acción que me hace este libro es hacía observar mis propios prejuicios, me lleva a analizarme de qué manera contribuyo a que el otro se sienta inferior, en qué manera contribuyo a que el otro se sienta invisible, a cuantas Pécolas estoy abandonando por mi propio miedo e incapacidad para enfrentarme a lo que me incomoda. Una obra demandante emocional e intelectualmente, que toca temas de segregación, violencia, abuso sexual y enfermedad mental; lo más interesante en la escritura de Morrison no es de lo que habla, si no la manera que tiene de hablarlo, de conectar con la reflexión y las emociones humanas. Con una marcada crítica social y una prosa excelente es un libro altamente recomendable.

We know that from the start, though. This was my first Morrison novel - perhaps I had been avoiding those simple, cursive covers - and here's what I found: a narrative slashed into puzzle pieces that we slowly put together - not to offer a full picture of the plot, but to solve, in part, how these characters came to be. While I want to know more about Pecola, the novel's dark sad center, her distance may be purposeful. It's a book about love in all its perversions as we wrestle to understand the very real and destructive shapes it takes; it's a novel about a broken society without stating ""society is broken,"" and instead shows us the seeds while asking us to look at the soil (Morrison's metaphor, not mine).

I felt deeply affected and it a few weeks of processing and unpacking to realise that, no I did not like this book, not because it isn’t brilliant- it 100% is absolutely brilliant. I didn’t like it because it hurt. I was hurting for Pecola. I was hurting for her family. I was hurting for myself and all the sore spots that this book poked with its layered themes.The story is told through multiple narrative voices, though it is ultimately about Pecola, she herself hardly features directly in the story. Instead, the book is narrated by Claudia who recalls the story of the people who have impacted Pecola’s life, whose own tragedies and pain incidentally cause the emotional and mental breaking of Pecola’s mind. It is a story of racial hate, intergenerational trauma, toxic and harmful perceptions of beauty, loss, friendship, pity, and pain. Of how the messages we internalise, messages shared within society, can be destructive. “When I began writing The Bluest Eye, I was interested in something else. Not resistance to the contempt of other, ways to deflect it, but the far more tragic and disabling consequences of accepting rejection as legitimate, as self-evident.”In this story, set in the late 1930’s, Pecola is thought of as ugly. She believes without a shadow of a doubt that she is ugly and the various people she encounters throughout her life reaffirm this idea as they can only see her ugliness too. In reality, Pecola is not ugly. She is just a child. But she as a character represents blackness, poverty, and trauma. She represents the opposite of everything that the society she lives in values. Her ugliness it not just about her appearance either, it a belief that has been passed down to her (intergenerational trauma) through her parents painful experiences of loss, racism and the impossible standards of wealth and whiteness that they can never meet [to be white is to be whole and wholesome, like milk as Pecola perceives it]. In essence she is a physical manifestation of internalised racism. The only person who does not see her as ugly and does not understand peoples prejudice against Pecola is Claudia, who at the time of their meeting is only 9 years old. “It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question."" (page 37, when speaking of the Breedloves)Toni Morrison takes a common event, such as racial contempt and dramatizes it. She blows it up into an extreme example and in doing this provides a narrative that is painful to read, but relatable. Pecola represents corrupted innocence, something which is particularly emotive for me having the experience of feeling ugly or being labelled as undesirable because of my blackness. Morrison masterfully elicits empathy for even the most hateful characters, particularly Cholly (Pecola’s father and abuser), by sharing their story and traumas. All of which help us understand Pecola decimation as a person even more. I could spend an age dissecting and analysing each of the characters, their trauma, and its impact on Pecola, but alas that is not the point. The ending (spoiler) was extremely profound for me. Seeing Pecola descend into psychosis should be a bad thing, but it isn’t. For her to believe that she has blue eyes provides a solace from the pain that has been her existence up until this point. The only way she is able to find peace is in the loss of herself and her reality. Isn’t that just devastatingly beautiful. In the afterword Toni writes, “Beauty was not simply something to behold; it was something one could do.”To me that is the point of this story, that beauty is not an affliction that only the worthy possess, it is within out actions, our words, our homes, our environment, the things we do and think and feel. It is subjective, introspective and goes beyond our eyes. ------------------------------------------------Original Thoughts 17/09/20:I have no idea how to rate this book. How do you rate something that's so poignant and relevant today? It is a disturbing story, laced with sadness that has left me deep in thought. Toni Morrison, through her dramatisation has demonstrated the damage of the racial prejudice and white washed standards of beauty that are deeply rooted in society. I feel sad that a book set in the 1930s, published in the 1970s has me recognising themes that are still present today in 2020. I highly recommend this read. **Be warned there are themes of sexual violence and child abuse**UPDATE 30/10/20:After giving it some thought I finally decided to rate this book 5 stars. It has so much depth and so many themes that have stuck with me since reading. It explores shadism and intergenerational trauma and the complicated relationship between ethnicity and identity in a way that can be easily missed if read on a surface level. I love that somehow by sharing an extrmeme and disturbing story Toni Morrison was able to explore these topics in a more digestible way. I want to reread this book soon for sure!Show more"

It is by far my favorite of the handful that I've listened to.

Het verhaal springt wat heen en weer doordat steeds wordt ingegaan op verschillende (bij)personages. Het is nogal fragmentarisch opgeschreven, alsof het eerder uit korte verhalen bestaat dan dat het één geheel vormt, en ik kreeg er hierdoor niet echt grip op.De thematiek is heel pijnlijk, en wordt op zo’n manier overgebracht dat die pijn ook echt voelbaar is. Dat vond ik knap gedaan en maakte wel indruk. Een belangrijk boek, dat ik af en toe wat verwarrend en zwaar vond, maar desalniettemin zou aanraden.Show more"

As a “non-English speaker” it was quite hard in the beginning to read. There were a lot of word I didn’t understand. But it didn’t stop me from enjoying the book. The book is about Pecola but there are multiple themes that come up in the book such as misogyny, colourism, classism, racism, … It’s a rollercoaster to be honest. Although it’s a sad story, the story is very well written. The book deserves all its praiseShow more"

I enjoyed the way it was written. By that, I mean the descriptions and the way thenauthor made you feel for the characters. On the other hand, the way the book changed and introduced characters was confusing. This book was heartbreaking and gave great insight into how life is different for each person, whether they are black or white. It did take me a while to realize the book was about Pecola.Show more"

Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe”.This gets three stars for writing style alone. Toni Morrison has a beautiful way of writing that is refreshing and poetic. This is an incredibly sad story, so be prepared if you decide to read. The humanization of Pecola’s perpetrators is both impressive and uncomfortable. A great recommendation from Brandon. Overall: 4 starsShow more"

Toni Morrison owns the English language. Not one word is wasted and at the same time she allows room and space and tangents. Every character is so unique but also general but also specific but also universal and I can’t stand how stunning it is. She does more than so many accomplish over their entire careers in her FIRST BOOK. Show more

Seeing how it plays out in every character. Internal hate is mad, then add abusive relationships/parents, poverty, racism and sexual abuse into the mix is sooooo sad. I really hate racism. Was hard to get into at first, but I devoured this in a couple of hours. This book has impacted me on a level I don't think I'll grasp fully. This book will stay with me for a while.

I think the unstructured approach weakens the story and makes things a bit too sketchy; particularly, the secondhand telling of Pecola's tale leaves one wanting to get to know her deeper - though I get the (brutal) notion that she is simply a child whose mind cannot begin to articulate the things that happen in the book. The childrens' point of view does add a subtle magic throughout. Morrison communicates a lot by talking of perception, feeling, memories, in a style which is recognizable in spite of allowing itself frequent poetic formal and subject digressions. I'll definitely read more by her because the presence of a great mind is certainly felt across the novel.3.75*Show more"

It is a painful reality stoked by America, inward and outward racism within and around being Black. Even though it's about Pecola, it's really about every generation around her uncovering trauma in a non-chronological manner in the most vulnerable sense - as children able to feel and articulate too early through a broken narrative, internalizing racism and inferiority. Everything is relative to who our ego feels better against. At the end, she still got what she wanted - the bluest of eyes and the soil the marigolds grew in was the issue.Show more"
