Once again, Gender Queer was cited by the American Library Association as the most challenged or banned book for the year (read the full list for 2023 here) in a year that saw 1, 247 demands to remove 4,240 unique titles among other library services, making for an alarming 65% surge from the previous year. But don't let that turn you away. Gender Queer, a graphic memoir by Maia Kobabe, is such an honest and open look at the author‚Äôs own path through understanding gender and sexuality. This is a beautiful book that will be useful to anyone looking to reflect on better understand non-binary gender, particularly as the telling is so full of careful nuance that looks at all the many avenues and aspects of non-binary identity and shows how discovering the language to assess identity is key in helping process yourself. Using the  Spivak pronouns e/em/eir, as in ‚Äòask em what‚Äôs in eir tea‚Äô, Kobabe shows how there are many ways to identify yourself in a way that feels true to yourself. 

 The path can be confusing, with Kobabe demonstrating how e grappled with different possible identities, realizing that asexual or trans were close but not quite right. For Kobabe, performing gender was less the issue as much as wanting to reduce gender‚Äî'I don't want MORE gendered traits, I was LESS'‚Äîand e‚Äôs journey is a really valuable story to help guide others in their own struggles with gender identity. Books like this one are really important, especially as this book can be read and understood at a younger age when finding yourself in the story will be super helpful and supportive. I wish I had found books like this when I was 14 instead of not realizing I was non-binary until my late 20s. Then it all clicked.The poet Charles Simic once wrote ‚Äòeveryone wants to explain the poem except the poet‚Äô and in that spirit I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt explain too much and just encourage you to read this. A general overview of the ideas is useful but I feel like Kobabe‚Äôs nuanced approach would be far more educational. Another book that I would recommend along with it is the graphic nonfiction, Gender: A Graphic Guide. It isn‚Äôt perfect but it gives a really useful overview and historical context. This is a really well done memoir that is very moving. Maia very tenderly examined eir life journey and interpersonal relationships, as well as really demonstrates a love for reading. I particularly enjoyed this as so much of my own journey to figuring my gender identity and sexuality came from reading. Shoutout to the poets, you gave me the words to understand myself. I really appreciate e‚Äôs approach to showing how much language can help us unpack ourselves. There are some amazing descriptions here or fresh ways to look at ideas that are helpful, such as Kobabe describing gender as less of a spectrum and more of a landscape. 

There are great discussions on using correct pronouns and why it is totally acceptable to ask others to identify you appropriately. 'Instead of asking people to do something to make you feel more comfortable, you'd rather just feel a little uncomfortable all the time?' someone asks Maia. While it is show how it can be difficult at first to switch pronouns (Maia included when having eir's first they/them professor), it also really shows the discomfort someone feels when being misgendered. Its a helpful and healthy lesson we can all learn.An important book that I‚Äôd love to see on the shelves of every public library everywhere. This book tends to be frequently the center of bannings, all of which being tantrums with little to no rationality behind them. Maia Kobabe put out this wonderful respose in the Washington Post about the situation and reminds us that these books can be a lifeline for teens who need it.

Maia relays all the ways their female body was stigmatized by societal norms (not being allowed to be topless even as a child, shaving etc) and the ways having a female body is a messy business (periods, pregnancy) and how that is compounded by social expectations (all women should love children and become mothers), but cannot connect that to their own discomfort with their body, even in passing. They also fail to understand discomfort with female puberty as a near universal experience among women despite talking about how this was discussed in one of the most popular children‚Äôs fantasy series of all time, the Lioness Quartet. Listen to other women. You are not alone in any of this. These are all common thoughts and experiences. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about NOT being female than BEING male.‚Äù I want to scream. This is exactly how so many of us feel and the reason we feel this way is not because of brain sex because brain sex doesn‚Äôt exist. It is societal. The way Maia dismisses their lesbian aunt saying this is due to misogyny but the conversation is not shown... it‚Äôs because Maia doesn‚Äôt have a rebuttal tbh. Just say, I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm #notlikeotherwomen and be done with it. And there are so many other little issues that are also grating:For example, someone should have told Maia that liking gay fanfiction is incredibly normal for straight/bisexual women. (Well, the thing is Maia knows this.)Also someone should have told Maia that 21 year old virgins don‚Äôt really need pap smears. And that no woman ‚Äúfeels‚Äù ‚Äúcis.‚Äù Cis is an almost totally useless and meaningless term. And there is no such thing as a female or male brain! The unbelievable misogyny of such a claim.And honestly it is not normal to be writing gay fanfiction of real, existing teenagers when you‚Äôre in grad school. Stop that.Show more"

Maia tells their story of self-discovery, and navigating gender with a lot of candidness and vulnerability. From the very first chapter, I was enthralled. Maia‚Äôs progression from confusion, then realization, to finally embracing, is one that I think a lot of people (regardless of gender, sexuality, or simply existentially) can relate to.Audiobook version can be found here: ""Gender Queer"" - AudiobookThe narration was amazing. The voice brought Maia‚Äôs words to life, and I could really feel the struggle, the joy, the pain, and every other emotion that Maia went through. It‚Äôs one thing to read someone‚Äôs experience, but having someone tell their own story really adds a different layer of connection.What really wowed me was Maia‚Äôs ability to discuss really complex topics like dysphoria, coming out, along with compassion and such clarity. It felt like I was having a really heartfelt conversation with a close friend who is sharing their most intimate moments. This book doesn‚Äôt shy away from the hard conversations, but also showcases the wins and the importance of finding a community that loves and supports you.A big takeaway for me was hearing about Maia‚Äôs relationship with their family and with friends, and how those relationships changed over time. It was a reminder of how important it is to have people who love and support you for who you are.Show more"

It's a memoir about growing up and figuring out that one is non-binary and asexual. While I am not asexual, I am non-binary...and while I can look back on my life now and realize I have always been this way, it took until age 30 to find the words. To realize, i'm not a freak. I'm not wrong. I'm not confused (anymore-and if I had had the words and someone else saying ""me too"" I never would have had to be). That i'm not alone. So many instances of ""OMG ME TOO!"" ""Yes, so much yes"" ""I feel this so hard"" ""Wait...there is a WORD for that? And it's not just me?"" It's a memoir of someone else's life but so much of it mirrored my own. Not 100% obviously, but a lot of it. And it made me feel so incredibly seen. I am still trying not to cry while writing this...and i'm failing. I'm so glad to finally understand my struggle with gender that i've had as long as I can remember. To finally know i'm not a freak, alone, wrong for feeling this way. And that there are words. Words can mean the entire world. In some cases I did honestly say ""lucky you"" to privilege's e had that I did not. Like on page 150 where e mention their lack of chronic pain and health issues. I was born with vacterl association. I am a medical nightmare, have always had chronic pain (getting worse as I get older) and I always will. But e is aware of that privilege.I would highly recommend this to, well everyone. Non-binary? Asexual? Queer? Wanting to learn? It's a graphic novel. It's easy and quick to read. It was hard hitting for me because I personally related to a lot of it. I needed this. I got it from Hoopla and I will be buying a copy so I can hug it! And re-read it.Though saying how much I related to this and having others read it feels like i'm getting naked in front of everyone. But oh well. Because I am who I am. And that's ok.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136222212-jay,Gender Queer,Rating 1 out of 5,"December 22, 2021",159 likes,5 comments,"This book is all about a girl wanting to be a super special snowflake and expanding upon her very obvious internalized misogyny. Maia clearly has major mental health struggles and decides to fixate on a dislike of being female as a way to feel empowered. Newsflash: many girls go through this. In fact, a ton do. Puberty really sucks. Growing up sucks. Young adulthood sucks. Eventually you grow out of it if you either give it enough time or actually work with a therapist who doesn't immediately jump to gender crap. If you think about it, everyone is technically ""non binary"" or ""gender queer"". No one is 100% feminine or masculine. That doesn't make biological sex not real. You are either male, female, or intersex (and most intersex people still are more male or female) and that's the only thing limiting you. Why have we basically gone backwards and are now more sexist again? Rejecting biological reality and playing pretend is a childish thing. And medical transition is just unnecessary and often harmful cosmetic procedures.Show more"

Here's one article on the controversy:https://news.yahoo.com/chicago-studen...Initial review: Gender Queer is a memoir comic by Maia Kobabe with a title that signals the desire to reach out to others, I think, of similar non-binary inclinations (or commitments). In this still relatively new moment of non-binary pronoun usage to signal identity, Kobabe uses the ‚ÄúGayatri Spivak‚Äù system of ‚Äúe, em, eir.‚Äù E (Kobabe) also identifies as asexual, though e does have a kink or two. For part of the book Kobabe identified as bi, but really, e does not want to be either a girl or boy (so e‚Äôs, just for the sake of identification, not trans), or have any sexual relationships with others, though we learn e tried. Eir (queer) sister at one point told em she thought Maia was genderless, and this might be something e might agree with, not sure. Eir family and friends have all been very supportive, it seems.I had to look up the difference between the non-binary/gender queer and gender fluid, which is more about fluctuating between genders, or being flexible about it all, as I understand it.Kobabe is shy, secretive, non-confrontational, so it seems like a particular act of courage for someone like em to write such a book, to share eir story, though probably more for others on the road to their own journies than even for em. (How‚Äôm I doing on the pronoun usage, kids?! I‚Äôm a cis-gendered dude of a certain age. . . I will admit I am still learning, and had to go over this several times. . .)Not that I think this book describes ‚Äúa phase,‚Äù but I have the sense that Kobabe will think somewhat differently about all these issues ten years from now, which is not to say e will suddenly become binary. I just have this feeling that part of identity for many people seems to involve exploration, just figuring things out. Youth is a particular time for this, of course; maybe for some people it happens later. Until this book made me think hard about it, I hadn't realized how many people I know that are probably gender queer. I like the art, I like knowing eir story. I guess the only issue I have with the book is that titling it thus makes it appear less autobiographical and more like a book that defines a topic, which it does not. It is about em and eir specific identity issues/commitments, while introducing you to the idea generally of people being non-binary. But anyone who is gender queer or knows someone who is ought to read this book, I think. You‚Äôll learn a lot. I did. I am glad it is being read by so many people already on Goodreads, people largely seeming to love it!Show more"

I liked how e captured the messiness of the process, about how e had to try out different types of clothes, relationships, etc. until e figured out what worked best for em. E shared the difficult parts of the process *and* the joyful parts, such as finding community who loved em for em and coming to a place of self-acceptance and self-knowledge. Given the horrid transphobic garbage happening in the United States right now, having written and published this memoir is unfortunately an act of courage.On the note of the widespread bans on this book‚Ä¶ honestly I don‚Äôt even really want to get into it because I‚Äôm in the home stretch of my residency, planning a move, and dealing with a gay crush, but I‚Äôll just say: how cruel do you have to be to hate people for living as their authentic selves?? The hate Maia Kobabe is receiving for living as eir authentic self in particular feels so unnecessary and bigoted. It‚Äôs interesting (and by interesting, I mean disappointing and disgusting) how wedded people can be to their own fixed, rigid notions of gender, sexual orientation, and attraction. If you want to be cisgender and romantic and allosexual, you can do that in your own life and leave trans, aro, and ace communities alone.Show more"

I was hopeful and excited to read a book that combined multiple things I love: a graphic novel storytelling format, personal memoir, and a topic related to gender studies/expansive gender identities.I was so disappointed in this book for so many reasons. The narrative aspect is just‚Ä¶bad‚Ä¶plus the book unknowingly perpetuates toxic ideas about gender/identity, such as presenting ‚Äúautoandrophilia‚Äù as a positive and/or neutral identity as opposed to a term weaponized by bigots to invalidate and demean transgender identities. I also think the author has a poor grasp of gender studies in general. When confronted by a relative who asks ‚Äúare you sure this isn‚Äôt just internalized misogyny‚Äù the author‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt have an answer? And didn‚Äôt even come up with an answer during the process of writing this memoir? You could‚Äôve just said ‚Äúmy gender identity isn‚Äôt about hating womanhood, I celebrate womanhood in others, but I celebrate my own gender in a different way‚Äù like this is a pretty basic thing you could‚Äôve put in your book that would really help other people. Also I have to say it. Referencing Supernatural incest fanfiction in a positive way in your debut memoir??? Really??? You couldn‚Äôt have left that out??? You couldn‚Äôt have picked literally any other pairing??? Why did you think this was a good idea????????The Supernatural incest fanfiction thing is‚Ä¶.really an apt representation of the whole memoir. The author is deeply flawed in presenting this as a resource for youths exploring their genders, because most of this book isn‚Äôt even relatable, much less a solid resource. It delves into the author‚Äôs personal experiences, but even those experiences are deeply limited. If you were a Tumblr fandom enthusiast back in the day (aka if the word ‚ÄúSuperwholock‚Äù means anything to you), then you‚Äôll connect to this book, but otherwise it‚Äôs not for you. I really struggle to see how Gen Z kids could relate to this book at all because of how stuck in time it is (and I say this as a Millennial who lived through the Tumblr fandom era myself, so I did catch all the references). In general, I hate to agree with conservatives on anything, but I also do have to say this isn‚Äôt really a book for younger audiences. I absolutely think younger audiences should have access to informative materials that encourage safe sex and healthy relationships from an LGBTQ+ inclusive standpoint‚Ä¶but this book doesn‚Äôt offer any of those things. The sex stuff in this book doesn‚Äôt contribute anything to the greater purpose of being relatable and informative to a marginalized population, and if anything presents problems without solutions that put readers at risk of taking on the author‚Äôs ignorance. For example, when the author has a gynecological exam, the result is mental trauma and extreme pain. But instead of opening up the topic to say ‚Äúoh this could be something called vaginismus and there are things like pelvic floor physical therapy that can help with this EXTREME PHYSICAL PAIN THAT IS NOT NORMAL,‚Äù the author just leaves the topic hanging except to say ‚ÄúI got a second exam years later and it was just as bad!‚Äù Like, it frustrates me that the author took what could‚Äôve been a great opportunity to address an issue that isn‚Äôt talked much about that affects a ton of people, and just‚Ä¶squandered that opportunity. It doesn‚Äôt help anyone! And this is just one of many instances in the book where the author is basically Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown‚Äîjust pulling the topic away right when it could become the most valuable, interesting, or informative. Really frustrating.Anyway, this book is overall just not good from start to finish, and I would recommend ‚ÄúTomboy‚Äù by Ivan Coyote as a far better personal memoir examining an author‚Äôs non-binary experience.Disclaimer: I am also non-binary I can assure you this book is just badShow more"

G√©nero Queer explora de un modo crudo y realista las experiencias de Maia durante su vida, enfrent√°ndose a sus miedos, a la disforia, a la atracci√≥n o no atracci√≥n sexual... Se tocan tantos temas y de un modo tan bueno, que es imposible no salir de esta lectura sin que te haya cambiado un poquito.No sab√≠a qu√© esperarme de esta novela gr√°fica autobiogr√°fica, pero desde luego no esto. La historia me ha atrapado por la manera de narrar que tiene Maia; es amena pero tambi√©n dura, graciosa pero complicada. Mantener ese balance durante tantas p√°ginas demuestra la autenticidad de su estilo, y sobre todo, de c√≥mo ha elegido narrar la historia de su vida. En ese sentido, en el m√°s te√≥rico si hablamos de narraci√≥n, introducci√≥n y desarrollo de personajes y dem√°s, un diez de diez. Redondo.El dibujo de Maia es sencillo, pero eso no quita que te transmita. Hay momentos sorprendentes, donde su estilos se ve modificado para mostrarnos pesadillas o momentos de enso√±aci√≥n, as√≠ como listas de cosas y de libros. Los que, por cierto, juegan un papel muy importante en la novela. (Y ya me he apuntado algunos t√≠tulos.)Pero sin embargo, con lo que me quedo es con la historia de la vida de Maia. Sus problemas con la sociedad para comprender su cuerpo y sus necesidades, el entenderse con los a√±os siempre compar√°ndose con las dem√°s personas, y algo que me hizo trizas el coraz√≥n fue ver c√≥mo no solo las series o libros que le√≠a le cambiaban la vida, sino la representaci√≥n que poco a poco -seg√∫n el mundo avanzaba- fue encontr√°ndose en su camino. La escena final genera una interesante reflexi√≥n sobre los referentes, y creo que es una de las tantas ense√±anzas que se pueden sacar de esta obra.Creo que Maia tambi√©n hace bien en mostrarnos de una forma muy sencilla los problemas del cambio social hacia la aceptaci√≥n de, por ejemplo, los pronombres neutros, y de c√≥mo es una lucha constante con las personas no binarias o de g√©nero fluido. Tambi√©n hace una muy buena introducci√≥n de ciertos elementos como la disforia, la asexualidad, los g√©neros y la feminidad, por ejemplo. Son temas que trata de un modo como nunca lo he visto y que considero que por su manera de hacerlo, cualquier persona que lea esta novela gr√°fica ser√≠a capaz de conectar con Maia, independientemente de sus creencias.G√©nero Queer te cambia. Si no conoces en profundidad temas de g√©nero o sexualidad, debes leerlo para comprenderlo de primera mano. Si ya lo haces, no te lo puedes perder. Es un nuevo enfoque, una nueva visi√≥n...

A little background, I‚Äôm an elementary school music teacher who previously taught high school music and dance. I‚Äôm also a biracial gay male who grew up in a small rural town in the US and had a really tough childhood and early adolescence due to bullying and not fitting in and now teach in a very progressive big European city (where I also don‚Äôt really fit in).I really do want to be sympathetic to this topic and whoever it affects as gender pronouns and non-binary‚Ä¶identity (I‚Äôm not sure how to word that) seem to be coming up more frequently every year. I appreciate that the author took the time to share her experiences, but don‚Äôt see in what way this particular book has any place in a school library or in the youth section of a public library. I found this frankly explicit and disgusting. There are things I openly discuss with friends but don‚Äôt tell my students or acquaintances or parents. I personally don‚Äôt care to read about someone‚Äôs use of a strap on to perform oral sex not do I care to see this much blood. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs any more appropriate to share in a school than an episode of Queer as Folk (which I very much celebrate as ADULT entertainment). Then again, I don‚Äôt feel the need to tell everyone I meet that I‚Äôm a bottom or what nsfw pictures I get on Grindr. I‚Äôm not surprised so many parents don‚Äôt want their kids reading this book as it is totally confusing and too graphic. Besides not being appropriate for a school setting, I think this book is just poorly written. It seems as though the author is rambling about whatever enters their head and I‚Äôm still left not seeing any need to confuse the whole world about your gender when you yourself are not sure what implications that has on your life. Beyond that, I don‚Äôt feel like the author had any personality except they read a lot and wanted very badly to fit into the ever growing LGBT etc label. I hope this was cathartic for the author and I‚Äôm giving it an A for effort, but it really was one of the worst books I‚Äôve read in a really long time.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,Gender Queer,Rating 5 out of 5,"April 28, 2022",89 likes,0,"I remember when I realized I never had to have children. It was like walking out of a narrow alley into a wide open field. I never have to get married. I never have to date anyone. I don't even have to care about sex. These realizations were like gifts that I gave to myself. pg. 178This is a relatable, well-written memoir by nonbinary author Maia Kobabe.I read it because of all the kerfuffle - this is the number one in banned/challenged books in America right now and I wanted to know why. Reading hysterical accounts of it being 'pornography' online obviously did not answer any of my questions.So I read it, and I found it delightful. Clear, helpful, and written by an author who is relatable.WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING IT IS RELATABLE, CARMEN? YOU ARE NOT QUEER.Ok, sometimes I doubt these 'conservatives' are actually reading the material they are foaming at the mouth to ban.Yes, this book is an INCREDIBLE and reassuring resource to teenagers (I would say 12 or 13+) who may be struggling with feelings about their gender or maybe worried that they are not sexual enough (Kobabe is asexual). It's SO important to see another person (in this case, Kobabe) wrestling with the same issues, questioning why e doesn't have a strong sex drive, questioning why e feels like neither a boy nor a girl.But honestly, EVERYONE should read this book. EVERYONE. For two reasons.1.) I think one of the big obstacles against the LGBTQIA+ community is straight, cisgendered people not really understanding what any of the letter-soup is. A lot of straight cisgender people might be a bit frightened of LGBTQIA+ people, not understanding them is a huge part of this. The fear and even disgust straight cisgender people may feel when confronted with 'scary queer folk' (especially in the narrative pushed by the right currently, about all non-straight people being pedophiles and etc. etc.) can be ameliorated. IT CAN BE AMELIORATED. It doesn't have to lead to hatred. Simply introducing queer characters into media has helped with this A LOT. Representation matters. Will & Grace. Willow Rosenberg on Buffy. I mean, stuff like the L-Word and Queer As Folk are amazing, but they are not mainstream. I'm more focusing on stuff you didn't have to pay to get. Stuff that you could get on regular, national television. Modern Family. It helps take the mystery away. It helps see a person with a queer identity in a different light for people who may not know any (out) queer people in their daily life.Someone who is not in an urban environment, maybe doesn't personally know any queer people, can pick up this book and say, 'Huh. I read this book and I relate to Kobabe.'Because Kobabe is very relatable. People might agree with eir for a plethora of reasons - even if the reader of this memoir is not queer. How about the fear and discomfort of getting a pap smear? Very relatable for a lot of women, especially young women reading this book who might not have gotten their first pap smear yet. How about Kobabe's amazing confidence in turning down dating/sexual partners who e knows won't work for eir? That's quite inspiring. A lot of young people lack the ability to maturely turn down people who want to date them. Seeing Kobabe practicing healthy boundary-setting and assertive self-protection is a great role model for teens.What about females who simply do NOT want to get married? Women or girls who do NOT want to have children? Straight, cisgendered women get tons of negative feedback for not wanting to get married or have children. Seeing Kobabe come to these decisions for eirself and about eirself is powerful. Sex isn't eir thing. This takes eir a long time to figure out. Readers might be struggling with the dawning realization that they have a low sex drive (doesn't necessarily mean you are asexual, although Kobabe is). This can be scary. Thinking you are a freak because you are uninterested in sex or fantasize about growing up to be the maiden aunt can make a young person feel alone. But tons of people struggle with this stuff. And seeing Kobabe do it is helpful and reassuring.Same thing with Kobabe refusing to shave eir legs or underarms. Or vulva, for that matter. Tons of women are interested in this, but society is BRUTAL in its enforcement of gender roles. Seeing Kobabe (and one of the women e dates) frankly discuss how they both have body hair before engaging in sex, and how that has to be a 'confession' because a female having body hair is SO SHAMEFUL is powerful and really can make teens (or any reader) think critically about how society forces gender expression. There's about 8 more examples of 'totally relatable stuff for readers, even if you are not queer' that I could list here.The book is not at all preachy. Kobabe speaks simply and honestly. You really understand Kobabe and where e is coming from by the end of the book. Kobabe doesn't shy away from troublesome elements. For example, e has a difficult conversation with eir lesbian, feminist aunt who thinks nonbinary and transgender is a form of misogyny. Or the part where Kobabe admits that as a young person, e fantasized about having to have eir breasts removed because of cancer - stating that since then people in eir family have had breast cancer and what a terrible fantasy that was. It's honest, it's reminiscent of a book by Judy Blume. Obviously, this book is aimed at an older audience than Judy Blume's audience. But the honest, helpful-to-youth, tackling-difficult-issues-without-being-preachy feeling is strong, just like Blume's work.Probably not a coincidence, since Blume's books were banned and challenged frequently. I think thata.) depriving teenagers of this material is doing them a huge disservice. The book is EXCELLENT. I am not saying this because it is queer, I have rated plenty of queer books 1 or 2 stars. Some queer books are horrible. So, this is not a case of me praising this book 'because it's necessary.' I don't believe in that, I always review books based on the book, not out of any sense of 'as a liberal I have to support this.' I don't have to support it, and frequently don't. However, the book is amazing and should definitely be in high-school libraries and in every public library. I would recommend it to LITERALLY everyone, regardless of whether they are in the queer community or not. It's just a smart, relatable, helpful book for all humans.b.) The idea that 'conservatives' seem to have that reading about 'gays' will 'make children/teens gay' is really bizarre to me. No matter how many books I read about lesbians, I'm not a lesbian. *shrug* If you don't like dick, reading about dicks isn't going to make you suddenly want to take a dick. I think literature is a huge gift to humanity, and that children and teens will self-censor. I was allowed to read anything I wanted to growing up. And I did. And I think it was one of the best parenting decisions my parents ever made. Children and young people read what interests them. Tons of stuff doesn't interest them, forbidding them to pick it up is only going to spark their curiosity. I think the ideas and concepts in this book are great. I think they are really helpful. I think the book is educational and interesting. That being said, a lot of young people will have absolutely no interest in reading it. Just let things take their natural course. If you want to know what I think is very damaging to children and young people, it's Internet porn. I would worry about Internet usage much, much more than BOOKS. I guess books are ban-able, though, and the Internet isn't. All this hand-wringing is completely pointless if your kid has a smartphone and/or access to the World Wide Web. Pornography is very damaging, and it's being introduced at younger and younger ages.Two ironic and sad things about this book is when Kobabe learns to read (at age 11!) due to Harry Potter. Must sting a lot in light of Rowling's outspoken views that we now know (this isn't discussed in the book. I'm just speculating). And TWO, Kobabe finding refuge, solace, and comfort in the library while discovering queer books and trying to figure out eir gender and sexuality. Books are so important, public libraries are so important. And now eir important, sensitive, helpful book about gender identity is being banned.PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED THIS BOOK IS PORNOGRAPHIC. IS IT? CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S IN IT?Sure. The book is NOT pornographic. However, it does tackle issues of sexuality and etc. It's definitely not meant to titillate or sexually excite people. It's not pornography.However, it does contain sexual material. Let's go over it. - Kobabe grows up with hippies and pees in the yard. There is a drawing of eir peeing in the yard as a 3-year-old. - E tries to go shirtless as a child (prepubescent) and is quickly made to cover up and be ashamed. - Discussions of periods, drawing of a bloody pad. I wouldn't even think this was 'offensive,' since it is a natural bodily function, but after the 'conservative' panic from Turning Red (Disney) about the HORROR of talking about menstruation, I'm mentioning this.  - Kobabe fantasizes about having a penis (no penis is shown in this part). E also discusses how imagining two gay men having sex is what sexually arouses eir. And fantasizing about eir (non-existent) cock getting sucked. No penises shown, it's just talked about. - Kobabe's older sister kind of dares eir to taste eir own vaginal fluids. Kobabe is asexual and finds this 'gross.' We see this progress later as e grows up to honestly tell eir female dating partner that e won't go down on her.  - Drawings of Kobabe undressing for eir first, terrifying pap smear. Shows a naked female body but it's just normal, not sexualized at all. The pap smear is horrifying for Kobabe, and there is a picture of eir naked body being impaled on knife to illustrate the trauma e feels about being penetrated. This is one of the most relatable and heart-wrenching parts of the book IMO. - There is a picture of a Grecian plate shown while Kobabe has a sexual fantasy in which a bearded naked man is touching the penis of a teenage boy.  - There's a scene in the book where Kobabe's girlfriend agrees to fellate a strap-on that Kobabe is wearing. As I expected, Kobabe doesn't enjoy it at all because there is no sensation in a plastic dick, obviously. E never does that again, and actually kind of gives up on sex permanently by the end of the book. The book is surprisingly unsexual for supposed, alleged 'porn.' After all, Kobabe is an asexual and even as a teen has a very low sex drive.That's pretty much it, make your own decisions on if your kid/teen can read this (if they are even interested, which I doubt). I can easily and happily see it in any high school. Lower age than that I probably wouldn't put it in a middle-school or elementary-school library. Saying this should be banned from elementary school libraries, though, is kind of like saying 'We should ban rhinoceroses from elementary schools.' This book simply isn't going to be there, it's not an issue. And I'm completely against book banning of any sort. PERSONALLY as an individual I wouldn't hesitate to give it to any kid age 12+, but I understand I'm very loosey-goosey with what kids read because I read anything I wanted to growing up and I think kids/teens should read anything that holds their interest - especially a smart, well-written book like this which will educate them and make them think. I'm also a feminist, so that might explain why I like this book so much. After all, I read OUR BODIES, OURSELVES when I was young. It was GREAT, this is kind of akin to that.Another huge boon in this book is that Kobabe has a loving, supportive, kind family. It can be depressing to read queer memoirs where the family is hateful and shames and humiliates the author. This book illustrates what a kind, accepting family can look like for a queer youth.TL;DR So glad I read this. I feel sad that Kobabe's book is being banned and challenged. It's an excellent book. Very helpful for any teens/adults who might be struggling to understand why traditional gender roles aren't suiting them; why the intense sexualization of American culture is not attractive to them. Why they don't spend hours fantasizing about a crush.But even beyond this, Kobabe is relatable to any reader. Any person who just wants to understand queer identity better should read this. Confused about what non-binary actually is? Confused about how a person can be born in a female body and not feel womanly or girlish? You don't even know what genderqueer means? Is Kobabe trans? What's going on here? Just read it. It's an excellent educational material for straight cisgender people. I think it can be a huge boon in taking away any fears or disgust people in 'mainstream' society might have regarding LGBTQIA+ people and that is super-important, especially nowadays with the right's insistence that 'queers are coming for your children.' The book clearly shows the reader a kind, relatable human being. Perhaps this is the real reason the book is being banned by the right. What if queer people are JUST LIKE YOU in a lot of ways?Show more"

A few times I had to set it down and cry. Be forewarned that I can't even pretend to aspire to objectivity, and brace yourselves for a review that's going to be more about me than about the book. Or move along if that (understandably) doesn't appeal to you.The graphic novel format lends itself well to Maia Kobabe's story, perhaps because it adds a playful element that complements the sheer quirkiness of eir life experience.This was me, too, from the time I was 11 years old. But I was born in an era when there was no way to communicate that fundamental fact about myself, because the language did not yet exist for concepts like gender identity. As I grew up I kept trying to tell people about ""how I am,"" but after a couple of decades had to give it up as a hopeless cause. Only recently did I discover that there are now, finally, words I can use to describe myself to others -- the most general of which is genderqueer. (More specifically, I identify as agender, i.e., I have no sense of gender at all. I can't even stretch my imagination far enough to guess what it's like for people to feel they have a gender; it's all a mystery to me.) It's a vast understatement to say I was wracked with envy as I read Maia's story of growing up in a world where the right words do exist, and people like oneself can be found and befriended.Yessssssssss.Maia seems content with the general self-description of genderqueer, with no need to pin it down further. I went through mood swings as I read, resonating powerfully with some of eir experiences, and finding others utterly alien, for example eir asexuality. Sometimes I just had to laugh at the odd parallels in our lives, like this:When I was a kid, I was the one everyone called if they needed to be ""saved"" from a snake. Actually I still am, because I'm on-call for my local community as a rattlesnake relocator. Enough (more than enough! ugh!) about me. I'd like to say more about the book, honestly, but it put me through the wringer emotionally, and I've pretty much exhausted my ability to be coherent. I hope it finds a wide audience -- or at least finds its way to the folks who can benefit from, and rejoice at, seeing genderquirkiness embraced and explored.Show more"

I absolutely devoured this story of heartfelt memoir, relentless vulnerability and coming of age. I can't imagine a clearer portrayal of gender complexity. Every thought and example on the page layers to make the reader understand what it feels like to be Maia.This is an impressive accomplishment for any memoir, but Maia's relationship with gender is even more unique than mainstream understanding of trans experiences. I'm gay and I struggle to fully grasp what it's like to have gender dysphoria. I understand why the straights struggle too and I sympathize. But I also know there's a political network desperate to make gender seem threatening and scary.Because Kobabe's book is so clearly articulated, it completely demystifies the threat of gender. By the end, Maia Kobabe comes across as normal as can be. That's the conservative movement's greatest fear -- a queer person goes about their day being happy and others are happy for them.As for the ""porn"" content in the book -- LMAO. Just about every PG-13 film I've seen is dirtier. This is largely an asexual book and the few moments of sex exploration are within the context of cautionary tale. There's no perverted agenda here, as the Karens scream. Let people live their lives and let them share their stories. Good grief.I'm so glad I read Gender Queer despite my tendency to avoid comics.

That is also just kind of depressing because sex is amazing and gender identity is a super fascinating topic.The problem with ""you problems"" is that they're, well, yours. Gender identity and sex are still things that exist, that we deal with in society, things that are a part of everyone's lives and need to be talked about and better understood even if you think they're gross, obscene, and pornographic to use a few of the words that have been applied to this very book.What ya'll never seem to understand is you're the one making these issues gross, obscene and pornographic. You're the ones who make them evil and sinful and things never to be discussed. You're the ones who think that if you just hide all these things that scare you from your children then somehow that will make them stop existing and you'll never even have to think about them having any influence at all on your safe, nice, totally made up ""normal.""Maia Kobabe had so many questions when ey were growing up. Ey wanted to understand all the weird, mixed up, crazy seeming thoughts and desires ey had roiling around inside em. Ey wanted reasons for all the weird fantasies and feelings. Ey wanted to stop feeling like ey were the only person in the world who felt that way. Ey wanted an identity that fit em even if it didn't match the ones society offered. Fortunately for em, ey were raised in a loving and supportive environment by a family that tried very hard to be there for Maia even when they couldn't quite grasp what ey were experiencing. Your kids don't even get that much. They get your version of support which always seems to amount to you frothing at the mouth while you yell ""get this pornography out of my child's school"" to an equally frothy group of ""concerned parents"" who are all wearing t-shirts that say something like ""Parents for Freedom"" unironically. What boggles my mind most is how good of a parent you think you are. You see taking away knowledge and understanding as an act of love. You raise your kids to be terrified of anything that isn‚Äôt part of this weird little ""normal"" illusion. But all that ever does is tell them that if they ever feel even for a moment like they don‚Äôt fit that awful, restrictive, totally made up mold there‚Äôs something wrong with them. You make them terrified of you. How can you even bear that? The idea that your children are terrified of you? I wonder sometimes what might have happen if you knew how much easier it is to go the other direction. I always thought that talking to my kids about ""big stuff"" was going to be one of the hardest things about parenting. But its so easy. It‚Äôs only hard if you make it hard. The world is only as scary as you allow it to be for them. When you let them know that it doesn‚Äôt matter how weird the question is or why they‚Äôre asking, you‚Äôre throwing them a life line that they‚Äôll be able to use their entire lives. Because they‚Äôll always know that you‚Äôre there without judgment or anger to listen to them. To talk it through with them. Literally all you have to do is be present for them and listen.That‚Äôs it.What you do is just so much harder. I mean getting the t-shirts printed must take hours! You have to get everyone's measurements, agree on a catch phrase that strikes just the right balance between white nationalism and doting mom, decide what color you want them to be. It just sounds so exhausting.In a backwards kind of way all this insane publicity you've managed to drum up for this book has been kind of a good thing. Banning and challenging it have probably done more to get it into the hands of the people that really need to read it than even the most sophisticated publicity junket could have. It‚Äôs inspired teenagers to start petitions and ‚Äúbanned book clubs‚Äù to get it back on the shelves. It‚Äôs called attention to Maia‚Äôs story and the beautiful way ey tell it. So good job? I guess?The first thing I did when I finished this truly excellent memoir was hand it to my thirteen year old son. I don‚Äôt necessarily think he‚Äôs non-binary, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs really even thinking too much about anything except how good of a season the Yankees are having right now but I read it and I wanted to share it with him because we both like graphic novels and I enjoyed it and it made me think and helped me understand things I‚Äôve had questions about and I hoped it would do the same things for him. To toot my own horn for just a second my son is a smart, capable teenager with questions about everything and I don‚Äôt always have the answers and I thought this book could be super helpful in his journey to becoming whoever it is he‚Äôs going to become. Or maybe it would inspire more questions he hadn‚Äôt thought of asking yet and we‚Äôd have some cool conversations about it and the world would get bigger for him. Books are great that way.When I drove him to school the next morning we talked about it a bit. He wanted to know if going to the gynecologist was really as scary as it seemed in Maia‚Äôs book. Yup, we talked about the gynecologist. He knows I go to the gynecologist. We debated how we were supposed to pronounce eir pronouns. (Turns out you say them just like you‚Äôd say ‚Äúthey‚Äù, ‚Äúthem‚Äù and ‚Äútheir‚Äù just without the ‚Äúth‚Äù thank you random article I found in Cosmopolitan of all places).We talked about how important it is for people to have access to this kind of story because other people have felt like Maia and it‚Äôs important to make those connections so you don‚Äôt feel so alone in your own journey to figuring out who you are. We talked a little about the people who have banned this book and why they‚Äôre trying to keep it away from kids his age.

I immediately stifled a cringe. As an out and (for better or worse) ""visible"" trans person, I'm often subjected to casual acquaintance's gender feels and queer adjacent pop cultural recommendations. But I like the person who suggested it so I told him I'd check it out even tho I don't really like comics. Part of me thinks that I am this book's ideal audience: a queer and trans person who can finally be ""seen"" by the literature that I choose to engage with, especially a story of a trans person realizing that they are gender queer or nonbinary and finding satisfaction with that identity. Sure, I often feel invisiblized by literature or television. But as a queer and trans person my whole life could easily be spent consumed by my feelings about identity or how my coming out can be shaped into a narrative, but honestly, that's not interesting to me. I do prefer Kobabe's story to Jacob Tobia's neoliberal black hole of garbage person narcissism. I do think that the world needs stupid and annoying trans narratives as much as it needs smart and compelling ones so that people can see that we're not any better or worse than cis people, we're just as messy and annoying and compelling.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Gender Queer,Rating 3 out of 5,"September 16, 2022",50 likes,0,"Gender Queer is the soul-baring story of author Maia Kobabe‚Äôs journey toward understanding eir gender identity through years of confusion. This graphic novel has been in the news for being banned by some American libraries because of its frank subject matter and shocking illustrations. It has these, but what‚Äôs gotten lost in the calls to ban are the ways Gender Queer is beneficial.Starting from a young age, Kobabe, who was assigned female at birth, didn‚Äôt gravitate toward those things society arbitrarily codes as ""feminine."" Kobabe now understands why and feels most comfortable with the gender-neutral pronouns e/eir/em, but getting to this place was a years-long struggle. Gender Queer is about the ups and downs. This memoir‚Äôs most significant lesson is that sex isn‚Äôt as straightforward as being born with either XX or XY chromosomes, and gender identity in general is complicated. This memoir becomes something more when Kobabe quotes parts of Patricia Churchland‚Äôs Touching a Nerve: Our Brains, Our Selves to provide a scientific explanation for why biological sex and gender identity don‚Äôt always align neatly. The science is a vital inclusion. Gender Queer shows how Kobabe‚Äôs identity as asexual and nonbinary was a recognition of these things about eirself, not a choice. Gender Queer has many pages devoted to the author‚Äôs childhood, but it‚Äôs obvious this is adult reading, as it seems Kobabe did intend it to be. The memoir is about gender identity, but it‚Äôs also more than a little about sex--specifically Kobabe‚Äôs sexual encounters and personal turn-ons. Discussions and illustrations are always honest and sometimes explicit. In adulthood, Kobabe learned the term ""autoandrophilia"" and instantly saw eirself in the description. The memoir feels imbalanced. The frank sexual sections are sometimes TMI--not because what e says seems ""improper,"" but because they overshadow the also important, but more mundane, sections. In another kind of memoir, some overshadowing might be no big deal, but it's unfortunate in a needed book like Gender Queer; the result is that the story is memorable more for its no-holds-barred sex illustrations and sex talk than for anything else, namely its larger LGBTQ+ message. It‚Äôs fair to say that Kobabe did not intend that. It‚Äôs in the more mundane parts that Kobabe truly furthered eir goal. These include scenes showing eir decision to use gender-neutral pronouns and choosing to wear clothing that jibed with who e really is. Kobabe‚Äôs attractions to people weren‚Äôt straightforward, so dating was complicated in unexpected ways. E was also repulsed to be the owner of breasts and a vagina, and visits to a gynecologist only worsened this repulsion; in unreserved detail, Kobabe shared how routine pap smears were frightening and painful. Gender Queer is highly personal. I did feel like I was snooping in a diary, but it‚Äôs an illuminating read, and Kobabe is genuine and very human in eir writing. There's no way to read this and not come away with much greater understanding of eir and others like eir.

I‚Äôve been skeptical of the recent rise in people claiming ‚Äúnonbinary‚Äù as their gender, perhaps in part because I don‚Äôt feel at all ‚Äúbinary‚Äù myself. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúlike a woman,‚Äù whatever that means (how many people really do?), and in the particular time and place where I live, my personality and priorities probably would have better suited me to being a man. But ultimately, gender stereotypes are a highly variable aspect of culture, and I have better things to do than sit around navel-gazing about it. This has not left me particularly sympathetic to people who declare that their own gender-nonconformity is so special and important that we all have to learn to use clunky pronouns and broadcast information about our own relationship to gender to all our professional contacts. That said, I like to understand where people are coming from, hence picking up this graphic novel/memoir, about the author's experiences as a young person identifying as nonbinary.And this is a perfectly fine book, which can easily be read in a sitting. The art is appealing though nothing mind-blowing, it‚Äôs easy to follow, and it does make me somewhat more sympathetic to the nonbinary thing in that the author does seem to have had significant, lifelong body dysmorphia/gender dysphoria (hating having breasts and a vagina, fantasizing about having a penis, preferring boys‚Äô haircuts and clothes, etc.)‚Äîto the point that Kobabe often comes across as a trans man. That said, there‚Äôs also a lot in here that really boils down to observations on difficulties of being female (you aren‚Äôt not a woman because you didn‚Äôt understand why you couldn‚Äôt take off your shirt in public as a child, or because you find having a pap smear as a virgin to be really painful, or because you like the nerdy designs found on boys‚Äô underwear only). But, I appreciate the author‚Äôs candid sharing of experiences (perhaps sometimes too candid; there were more bodily fluids here than I‚Äôd have liked!), and found it worth the time to read. While I think everyone would be better served if we put less emphasis on gender rather than carving out new labels and identities to cling to, it‚Äôs a good reminder that what may look from the outside like a piece of vanity may well be the result of a lot of inner turmoil and not something arrived at lightly.

Not that I wouldn't have read it anyway (it's totally something I would read) but I saw it available from the library and snagged it, and once I started it, I couldn't stop reading. I found this entirely relatable, despite my being cisgender. The graphic novel format conveyed so much in so few pages, and really illustrated the journey and the struggle and the EVERY DAY battle for self-identity and identification that so many LGBTQ+ people go through in our heteronormative society. I can't really imagine how hard it would be not having a word to describe myself. I mean that literally. I can't imagine how I would feel, because that seems to me to be one of those things that one has to experience to really understand. But I can empathize with the feeling of being other and different, and of the joy of finding community and support and a new lexicon to help define the previously undefinable. Anyway, I really loved this. It was vulnerable and honest and despite it only taking me an hour or so to read, packs an emotional punch. I found myself wanting answers to some questions, and needing a resolution to some things, and when the book ended, feeling a little disappointed to not get that - until I remembered that this is literally someone's real life, and none of us has all of the answers.Definitely recommend.

I read this book with an open mind and a driving willpower to keep reading despite the bad illustrations. I agree that the book was graphic in some parts and should not be read by children, a 16+ audience would be better able to understand this book and process it the way it should be: by heart. Maia didn't know how to read at the age of 11, and they had to teach themselves how to read overnight in the darkness of their room. Maia hid their first period from their mom. Maia used toilet paper as a pad. Maia kept the same pad on for hours, til ""blood crumpled like coffee grounds"". Maia went around in school stinking of sweat to the point other kids made it a problem with the school administration and Adults had to intervene. Maia didn't even have a deodorant. Maia had an skin reaction to the deodorant and waited til the skin on their armpits had fallen off to tell their mother. Maia wanted their hair cut short like a boy but refrained from expressing that desire to their family for YEARS, resulting in negative feelings about theirself. Maia was never taught about periods, how to cope with them, how the body works in general and how the female body works specifically, how to cope with suddenly growing boobs in puberty and how to find the perfect fitting bra, what Maia should and shouldn't be ashamed of having, normal manners in society etc. I could read and write at the age of 4 years old, my mom taught me. I ran to my mom when i had my first period. She comforted me and celebrated the most special day in my life as a woman. She taught me how to use pads and when to change them so i didn't either smell or get sick from sitting on clumps of blood for hours and hours. I bathed frequently and had my personal set of selfcare products from a very young age. If anything, Anything at all was wrong with me or made me feel bad, i told my parents and discussed it with them, especially health issues. I had my hair cut short like a boy up til the age of 13. My mom helped me with bras and getting gradually adjusted to them. Most important of all, my mom taught me societal norms.I feel sorry for you Maia. I think you were neglected as a child. Although your parents are supportive of you now, they should've done a hell lot more to support you during your difficult years of growing up, and not just teach you venomous snakes. I am saying all these things about my personal life because after reading yours, i want you to read mine. It's not normal to go around smelling bad and it's not normal to be illiterate at the age of 11, even worse considering your parents both attended college and are intellectuals. They couldn't make time to teach you how to read? They didn't notice you smelling? If your mom had zero idea you were going through this BIG, BIG turmoil inside of you, big enough to literally change your life, then she isn't a good mother. She did not pay attention to her kid having literally the biggest LIFE problem. I have nothing to say about your personal feelings. It's your life. But you stench of hypocrisy.You say it's not about being male, it's about not being female. You stack masculine blocks on the gender scale to balance out the female genitalia as to achieve looking as androgynous and genderless as possible, and you say you'd do the opposite (stack typical female things like ""florals"") on the scale if you had male genitalia. Yet you lay in open field holding grass as a penis, you daydream of having a penis but shaving off your boobs, you get off on imagining you have a penis, you ""feel"" it sit between your legs. You made someone suck a strap on dildo thinking you'd feel it. You'd take testosterone ""if it made you grow a d*ck"". You WANT to be male.Your feminist lesbian aunt is right, this is a movement that is misogynistic, especially this book reeks of it. You say it's not like that, and have a conversation with your aunt til 1am about it giving zero reasons to the reader (supposedly a child) why it's not like that. Why is it not like that? You hate your female everything and everything female: You had recurrent nightmares about getting your period, you said you hate your period, and your mom says ""everyone hates their period"" as if getting a period is bad or like that statement is true. I don't hate my period, although painful, i don't hate it, getting a period means I'm a healthy woman. You dream of getting top surgery, surgically removing your boobs, a woman body part. You dread going to the girls aisle in stores to buy girl underwear and give away the girly pink underwear. I'd say you hate women, but i honestly feel like you just hate yourself.You called floral patterns a girly thing, but ironically enough you yourself end up wearing floral after seeing other people wear them. You spend your whole life building a neutral coloured wardrobe, with men's simple outfits, just plain jeans and shirts, rejecting all things pink and colourful, to have all your lifelong identity thrown to the side after seeing others liking it. That zeroes your whole argument.And three last things:1. You, as a doctor, don't insert a speculum in a patient's vagina if they've never had sex before, aka a virgin. I confirm this as a patient and as a doctor. It is very painful and I'm sorry it happened to you. I understand the trauma that came with it. 2. Never, ever, ever, EVER suggest puberty blockers to a pre-pubescent, from a medical standpoint.3. At the very last pages, you say coming out to your students (children) could make parents mad and get them together to fire you, ""but the administration would back you up"". Very sneaky putting that in there, subtly tearing apart children from parents. You should get fired just for this sentence alone.If this book's purpose truly was to resonate with a non binary kid out there who's lost on their identity, it would not have graphic illustrations or mentions and explicit visualisations of gay fics. It'd be your story and some words of advice to these kids. This is not a children's book. It's your autobiography in a way and a political agenda in another. It was nice reading your perspective, but for the parts i mentioned above, i didn't like it. Visually the comic wasn't that nice. Build your non binary ideology on something that doesn't bash women and femininity.Show more"

I guess the target audience for this book is people who have no idea who they are and they spend a lot of time and energy stressing about it, which is not me. I mostly figured my shit out by the time I was like 17 or 18.The problem is if I met someone who was a total disaster about their identity/sexuality, this isn't the book I would recommend. Because I'm so uncomfortable right now. This might be the most uncomfortable thing I've ever read.I just don't really care that much what other people think, and the author seems to care SO MUCH. I can't relate to making it this far into your 20s and still caring this much. Or being this confused. This is excruciating. This reminds me of being in middle school. You know when you were a pimply little teen and you would do something embarrassing and you'd have the urge to hold your breath until you died? That is the feeling this book reminds me of.Note: I'm mad at the author's parents. Who doesn't teach their kid basic social rules before sending them to school? You can let your kid be however and still give them a heads up about how other people operate. It's like moving to Japan and not bothering to tell your kid anything about Japanese culture and sending them to school to find out everything the hard way. Why would you do that?Show more"

The big controversy is only that it's a comic sometimes in the YA section of libraries, but there's no grand reason this needed to be the ""most banned book in America"" as reviews can't help but mention. Comic readers of indie autobiographies will enjoy Maia Kobabe's book, which communicates well albeit in a straightforward and direct manor. That's often the strength of the comics medium, as opposed to the more cerebral medium of prose. For LGBT+ teens, there's a lot more value in being able to relate to this story. They should all absolutely have the opportunity to read Gender Queer. And for others, allies etc., it's always good to learn about different communities and thus empathize with the diversity of human experiences out there. Of course, it's deeply personal and somewhat graphic. What else could the book be? That may be considered self-centered and not for everyone, and that's okay too. Again, what's to everyone's tastes shouldn't be so controversial.On every level, it's a successful book illustrated with care that expresses with purpose.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159895-petergiaquinta,Gender Queer,Rating 3 out of 5,"November 20, 2021",26 likes,1 comment,"""I know it when I see it,"" Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously wrote in 1964 in his concurrence to the court's ruling in the obscenity case of Jacobellis v. Ohio. That's the year I was born, and Stewart was talking about hardcore pornography, which Stewart asserted is the only form of obscenity actually prohibited by the Constitution.Over the last 57 years since then, I've seen my fair share of pornography and I've also seen plenty of things that are not pornography and so, like Stewart, I know it when I see it myself. Therefore I can tell you with absolute certainty that Maia Kobabe's graphic novel Gender Queer is not pornography, despite all the screeching going on at school board meetings these days courtesy of the knuckle-dragging crowd of lunatic fringe parents whose attention seems to have shifted from destroying their children's history curriculum to going after books in their school libraries that they don't like.Just in case you are not familiar with the phenomenon, here's what happened earlier this week in Downer's Grove, Illinois, a suburb with a silly name just a few miles down the road from where I live:Chicago Tribune:https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/b...Daily Beast:https://www.thedailybeast.com/downers...And sadly elsewhere‚Ä¶Anchorage Daily News:https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/educa...As you can see, Gender Queer has been making the local and national news these days and parents have been waving ""NO PORN"" signs at school board meetings and doing a lot of yelling about how these books are making their kids gay, and with all this going on I felt I needed to have a peek for myself and see what was causing such a ruckus, especially in my new position as Sub-Sub Librarian at my high school, where I've retired from teaching after thirty-some years in the English classroom.So yesterday on the way out, I checked out our school library's copy of Gender Queer, took it home and dove right in. And it was pretty clear from the get go...this is not pornography. Instead, what you'll find in Gender Queer is a poignant and at times rather painful graphic novel depiction of the author's journey in life from a young age to the present as she tries to puzzle out where she fits in a society where gender and sexuality is prominently emphasized and where her growing sense of her own nonbinary, asexual identity doesn't seem to make sense to the people around her or even to herself.From early childhood, Kobabe began to feel different. She struggled to come to terms with the way boys and girls were treated differently in her elementary school; she felt disgust for the way her body was changing as she entered puberty; she found no interest in the high school dating game, and she didn‚Äôt understand why she feels this way and was so different from the other students around her. Kobabe thinks something is wrong with herself; she wonders if she might be gay and she joins the gay alliance student group. As she gets older, she attempts to have lesbian relationships, but they do not work out for her because she is not at all interested in sex or romance. Kobabe's graphic novel explores in great detail her negative response to her body and gender and the confusion she experienced regarding how she didn't fit into the binary system of gender identification. By the end of the book, she has made a great deal of progress in her journey to self-understanding, but she still struggles with her identity, especially in gaining the confidence to speak for herself and assert her choice of pronouns among others.(Side note...I understand that Kobabe uses different pronouns for herself and maybe I'll go back and touch this up later but for the ease of cranking it out now, I am leaving it with female pronouns.)So, this graphic novel is hardly pornography by any stretch of the imagination. There is one page in the book that is particularly troubling to the ""books make my kids gay!"" morons, and it's been frequently reproduced and passed along, so maybe you've seen it by now. On that page, Maia and the woman she is involved with at the time are experimenting with a dildo; Maia doesn't like it. In fact, she doesn't like having any kind of sex at all. The two panels in question are mildly graphic in nature if you don't want to see somebody with a dildo in their mouth, but that's pretty much it. Oh yeah, and there's also an image of an ancient Greek urn with a couple of naked Greek dudes on it doing naked Greek stuff. Scandalous!However, in context, those images can hardly qualify as ""pornography."" Instead, I would suggest that Gender Queer is literature quite deserving of its place in the high school library. Here's just my own perspective of what good literature does and how Gender Queer qualifies...As a person who has always identified as male and enjoyed sex, I have rarely even considered the possibility that there are people in the world who do not identify as male or female, who loathe their bodies, and who find human sexuality immensely troubling. I have a hard enough time wrapping my head around people who identify as trans, and what Kobabe is describing in this book goes way past that gender confusion. In my experience as a teacher of thousands of teenagers over the decades, I have had students experiencing gender dysphoria and struggling with their bodies or their sexuality. As a young dumbass, I might have been antagonistic toward people like this. As an older and hopefully wiser individual, I have developed sympathy for these students, but in all honesty I could not say I fully understood the challenges they were facing in these areas of their lives. I have tried my best to be helpful or kind to students in transition or struggling with gender roles or their sexuality. But it would be inaccurate of me to say that I truly understood the pain and the anxiety they were experiencing.However, in Maia Kobabe's book, for the first time I have stepped into the shoes of someone experiencing gender dysphoria, and by reading this graphic novel I think for the first time I have gained some real insight into what people like Kobabe are going through in their lives. This is what good literature does. This is why we study literature in the classroom and why we fill our libraries with books that don't just reinforce the worldview we have developed in our own lives but which challenge us to see the world differently, to step out of our own experience and to gain some empathy for others very different from ourselves. This ultimately is why we read books and have libraries, to learn more about the world, develop empathy for others around us, and ultimately become better human beings.That's something these parents need to learn. Listen, I don't think Gender Queer is the best graphic novel I've ever read. But I do know that I'm a better human being today for reading it, better than I was 24 hours ago. And now that I‚Äôve seen it, I know it deserves its place in the high school library and it clearly is not pornography.Show more"

Like most coming of age books, this graphic novel (‚Äòcomic book‚Äô to us old people) is a first-person account of someone who grows up feeling different, with all the societal problems and searching that come along with that. Within the story, Maia struggles with defining both eir sexual identity and eir gender. Maia‚Äôs storytelling is honest and unvarnished, allowing the reader to empathize with eir journey from childhood to adulthood.Within the book, I found a deeper understanding of what it must be like to be different in a way that is so fundamentally difficult to discuss with most people. My daughter has a few gender-queer friends, and after reading the book, I found myself more empathetic and respectful, striving to be more careful to use their preferred names and pronouns. The book also offers a unique view for parents, touching on issues such as breast-binding, which is a very difficult issue for even the most progressive parent. Maia‚Äôs mother says ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt hate your body‚Äù, and Maia answers ‚ÄúThe majority of my body is great. There are just a few bits I don‚Äôt like.‚Äù This part of the book is hugely valuable to progressive parents of transgender teens, who are constantly struggling to reconcile a desire to affirm that all bodies are perfect just the way they are with the desire to affirm a transgender child‚Äôs identity. Maia expresses this desire and its motivation in a manner that most teens cannot, and this allows us to understand and empathize in a way that can lead to more productive conversations, even if it does not help us reconcile the fundamental dichotomy of the issue.Why it is ControversialYes, there are many people who dislike the book because of the ideas: the fact that it portrays a person‚Äôs transgender journey and the fact that it normalizes queer relationships. But if that was all it was, there wouldn‚Äôt be nearly the controversy that is surrounding this book.The book is controversial because it is a GRAPHIC NOVEL (illustrated, like a comic book) that includes a person‚Äôs sexual awakenings and relationships. That means that, yes, it has quite a few graphic pictures. One controversial drawing occurs when Maia is an adult and is in a consensual, monogamous relationship with another person who was assigned female at birth. Maia‚Äôs partner texts to say that they bought a strap-on and that they can‚Äôt wait to give Maia a blow-job. In the next panel, there is a picture of what appears to be a person giving a blow job. This is actually a person sucking on a strap-on. But‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ yeah. That‚Äôs a pretty big line to cross for a high school library shelf. Enter the controversy!!!There‚Äôs a lot to unpack in this controversy. We do recognize that it is reasonable to limit such images in our American culture: the image would not be allowed on network TV or on Facebook. So it is an interesting question to ask about finding this image in a book on the high school shelf. Even when we all agree that sex is a normal and natural phenomenon, we have a general cultural taboo against flashing pictures ‚Äì even drawings ‚Äì of sex in a public setting with people who are under the age of 18. The counterpoint is that the drawing and the small series that follow show Maia not enjoying the strap-on blow-job, discussing this with eir partner, and then having a loving moment in with the partner acknowledges Maia‚Äôs feelings and offers to work on finding something else that they both enjoy. This is the epitome of a healthy sexual relationship, which is why so many are passionate about keeping the book in a place where queer teens can find it. Such a message is undeniably valuable.But the fact that it has undeniable value for some kids doesn‚Äôt immediately solve the controversy. Something can have undeniable value, but still be inappropriate for some readers. In the case of Gender Queer, it is arguable that the images are fine for a mature 17 year old, but inappropriate for a 13 year old Freshman. Another common layer to the controversy is that society generally recognizes that a parent has the right and responsibility to restrict sexual content for their child, since the parent is usually the best gauge of when a child is mature enough for such content. Throw in the fact that a graphic novel, unlike a written book, can be flashed at another kid without consent and um‚Ä¶. Yup‚Ä¶ we have a really complex issue without easy answers.Why I‚Äôm In Favor of Pulling it from a High School Library ShelfThe most problematic picture in the book isn‚Äôt the oral-sex graphic. It‚Äôs the graphic of Maia‚Äôs early sexual fantasy. Here‚Äôs the context:Because the book deals with Maia‚Äôs gender identity and because one‚Äôs gender identity is often closely intertwined with one‚Äôs sexual identity, it is not surprising that the book deals with masturbation, especially in the portion of the book about Maia‚Äôs adolescence. Early-on, Maia notes that ei‚Äôs masturbatory fantasies often involve more imagination and less interaction with eir genitals. To illustrate this, there is a panel that shows Maia having ‚Äúan elaborate fantasy based on Plato‚Äôs symposium‚Äù. The illustration is of a naked man kneeling down and cupping the genitals of a standing naked boy.Okay, it‚Äôs taken me over a WEEK to unpack that drawing. So first, a bit more context: in Plato‚Äôs symposium, one of the philosophers argues that the highest form of love is between a man and a boy in which the boy sexually gratifies the man in exchange for wisdom and virtue. Whether you know the context of Plato‚Äôs symposium or not, it‚Äôs tough to identify the picture as anything other than pedophilia. That‚Äôs not to say that Maia is condoning pedophilia, what the picture MAY be illustrating is the basic fact that many adolescents have fantasies about adults: we joke about the many younger boys who had a crush on Pamela Anderson when they were kids. In the context of the book, Maia MAY also be trying to say ‚ÄòI am aroused more by intellectual discussion than by physical stimulation, and just have chosen a very poor Platonic argument as an example. But it‚Äôs DEEPLY UNCLEAR what message was trying to be conveyed in that frame. Even through an adult lens, I am only guessing. And this is where the real concern with the book comes from: we do recognize that minors can have sexual feelings toward non-minors. And even while recognizing that such feelings in minors may be normal, we also recognize how intensely dangerous such feelings and relationships can be because child predators exist and minors aren‚Äôt good at understanding the danger and inappropriateness of a predator‚Äôs attention. Thus, we do everything we can to avoid normalizing a romantic or sexual relationship between a minor and a non-minor. And even though it can be argued that this book is portraying an adolescent‚Äôs childhood fantasy similar to the fantasies that heteronormative young boys have of adult female movie stars, we nevertheless must admit that the message in the book isn‚Äôt clear-cut enough to avoid a potentially dangerous misinterpretation to the minors reading it. Why I Didn‚Äôt Give the Book to My DaughterThe paragraph above is reason enough, but even without that most problematic image, I would caution any parent to avoid giving the book to a teenage girl until after she has had her first gynecology appointment. Maia portrays her first visit to the gynecologist as ‚Äú45 seconds of the most excruciating pain of my life.‚Äù This comment is followed by an image of a person kneeling on the ground in pain and impaled through the abdomen by a giant sword. Maia‚Äôs second visit to the gynecologist is not portrayed in a more positive light, with the comment ‚ÄúThe speculum entering my body felt like a knife being shoved into my vagina. I screamed and immediately started sobbing.‚ÄùMy own daughter is nearing the time for her first appointment and we have been talking about what to expect at the gynecologist; I‚Äôm honest but reassuring. And I do not want her to read this book before she has that appointment, since doing so can only exacerbate her anxiety, not ease it.This is not meant to be a criticism of the book, but is rather a warning for other parents. It‚Äôs important to remember that Gender Queer is a memoire, not a work of fiction. The events and feelings are Maia‚Äôs and I do not wish to diminish Maia‚Äôs experience. Certainly ei felt that this type of violation was too much for eir. Gynecology appointments are uncomfortable, unpleasant, and scary the first time. I didn‚Äôt sympathize with the sentiment that the speculum felt like a knife, but I‚Äôm sure some people will, and this sympathy will help those people feel acknowledged and affirmed. But I can recognize that value and still recognize that the book does not belong in my child‚Äôs hands right now. In ConclusionBe sure to read this book cover to cover before handing it over to your teenager. There are several conversations that you may wish to have after they read it, including safe driving, the importance of gynecology visits, and sexting at work or school.Show more"

The personal journey of the author in discovering eir sexuality is told. While doing so, e also discusses all of the varieties of gender and sexuality people explore in learning about their bodies and identities.I have copied the book blurb:‚Äù In 2014, Maia Kobabe, who uses e/em/eir pronouns, thought that a comic of reading statistics would be the last autobiographical comic e would ever write. At the time, it was the only thing e felt comfortable with strangers knowing about em. Now, Gender Queer is here. Maia's intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma of pap smears. Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity‚Äîwhat it means and how to think about it‚Äîfor advocates, friends, and humans everywhere.‚ÄùI highly recommend this read!Edit April 27, 2023:Unfortunately, ‚ÄòGender Queer‚Äô is now number one on the list of books banned in Florida and Texas, and in other midwestern and southern American states.‚ÄúWhat is the new law in Florida about books?The law known as HB 1467 requires media specialists to undergo training to make sure library materials are not harmful to minors, and warns that violators face a third degree felony charge.Mar 6, 2023‚Äù -GoogleMeanwhile in Texas:‚ÄúBooks at issue include ‚ÄúCaste: The Origins of Our Discontent‚Äù by Pulitzer-winner Isabel Wilkerson; ‚ÄúBeing Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen‚Äù by Jazz Jennings; and books related to sex education and bodily functions, including ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health‚Äù by Robie Harris.‚Äùhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-...‚ÄúTexas bill proposes jail time for teachers providing 'obscene' booksA Dallas-area state representative wants police to investigate cases of obscenity in books at schools.‚Äùhttps://www.chron.com/news/houston-te...Gentler reader, many of these same American states go insane with heterosexual female sexuality, full stop. ‚ÄúPurity balls‚Äù are encouraged where preteen girls dance and exchange promise rings with their dads, swearing on Bibles to keep themselves ‚Äúpure‚Äù for dad. Frankly, many of the girls don‚Äôt even know what their vaginas look like, much less how a baby is made. They only know their vaginas are a filthy impure part of their bodies. Penises are not filthy or impure, but are celebrated in all areas of culture all over the world, gentle reader - with the exception of those of pedophiles (at least in Western countries). Apparently fathers who exchange purity rings with their daughters are also good to go. The Purity Myth: How America's Obsession with Virginity is Hurting Young Women Many women are not able to convince conservatives to let them alone no matter what their sexuality. Full stop.In case you are thinking this banning of books about sexuality is a choice school districts have, it isn‚Äôt. Schools and many local libraries are pulling all books with lgbtqia authors or characters off of their shelves because of tough laws that have been passed by state legislatures or local communities that by law forbid young people from learning that some people are not heterosexual from books. School librarians and teachers may be fired from their jobs, losing their teaching credentials, if they recommend reading materials that have been banned, or discuss sexuality or possess any book in their classroom or school library discussing sexuality. Public library librarians in the South and Midwest have also become fearful of having ANY books written by lgbtqia authors or books on any shelves that include lgbtqia characters. There have been stories of librarians in Florida and Texas pulling books about queer sexuality from public libraries, not just school libraries.These are the same states that are also banning every book conservatives can identify that are about the American history of the enslavement of Black people by White people, including books about the Civil War that discuss slavery. Some librarians, especially school librarians and teachers, are also getting rid of ANY books with Black characters because they are afraid of losing their jobs if books about Black people, or written by Black people, are in the libraries.The same American states above mentioned also encouraged public schools during the second President Bush‚Äôs administration to cut all or most of their science classes, unless they use textbooks that described how God created the Earth in six days, as an alternative to evolution. Science textbooks needed to include statements emphasizing that evolution was only a theory, inferring the six-day creation by God was not. Public schools in the Midwest and South in the past and currently are still fighting over rules that Homerooms must start the day with Christian prayers (when school boards sometimes lose this regulation in the South or Midwest, they usually put in place a non-denominational prayer) along with the Pledge of Allegiance.These same states are banning or have banned abortion rights. Doctors or health professionals can actually be arrested, charged, convicted, and sent to prison if they don‚Äôt force women to have their babies, no matter how sick the baby or mother may be from the pregnancy. Bleeding to death or dying from some other cause from a pregnancy gone bad is the inferred preferable outcome in the public statements made by some state and federal legislators. Already there have been cases of doctors standing by helplessly while mothers and newborns lose their lives during or shortly after a birth because of these new State laws, even if the laws banning abortion include provisions that it is ok for a doctor to do an abortion if the mother‚Äôs life is endangered. Like many of the librarians and teachers, many doctors have become scared to death to do their jobs, any of their jobs, when it is about pregnancy or lady parts at all in the South or Midwest.Show more"

Kobabe's graphic memoir is so effective at explaining how eir experiences with gender from childhood through adulthood were complex and hard to pin down, a slow process of discovery. E also explores asexuality as well, which can further complicate both gender and sexual identity. We are still in the beginnings of having nonbinary people tell their own stories, so it's not too surprising that in this wave we have a lot of memoir. I did not mind it at all, and Kobabe is adept at putting eir emotions and stories in pictures to heighten the experience.Sometimes I read a memoir and think, ""This person needs more distance from their story to tell it effectively,"" but I never thought that about GENDER QUEER. Kobabe's strength here is keeping you in a feeling of the present, a feeling of change and discovery, and when we leave em at the end of the book, we don't have to feel like everything is now figured out and settled. We know e is on a journey that may take em to a new understanding of emself and that is a beautiful thing. If you aren't familiar with nonbinary people, who are a vast group with a spectrum of identities, there is much to learn here. Even as someone who has many nonbinary friends, I gained a new respect here for nontraditional pronouns. Most people I know use they/them and I admit I have felt somewhat reluctant to adopt more unusual pronouns even though I strongly believe you should always respect a person's identity and pronouns. After reading Kobabe's story about finding e/em/eir pronouns (also known as Spivak pronouns) I could shake off my discomfort and embrace a broader set of pronouns.Show more"

Eir experience with gender has been fraught since ey were a child (is that the correct usage?). Maia has never felt like a boy or girl, and spent quite a while coming to terms with that. This book also touches on eir sexuality, which ey explored especially in college, before coming to terms with being asexual.It‚Äôs an extremely personal memoir, only enhanced by Kobabe‚Äôs art, which is expressive and poignant. The book actually opens with Kobabe confessing that the idea came from a school assignment where the teacher asked em to list things that bothered em the most, or made em uncomfortable. Everything on Maia‚Äôs list was to do with gender. Even despite that discomfort, this memoir doesn‚Äôt really hold back, and seeing that discomfort so clearly on the page is part of what makes this memoir so powerful.I say this is personal, because there isn‚Äôt any way to honestly depict a memoir about coming to terms with your gender identity and sexuality, about living in a human body, without getting personal. Kobabe runs the gamut, from eir childhood to adolescence, through college. The memoir depicts Kobabe‚Äôs emotional journey through exploring eir attractions, eir relationship to their body (dealing with the pain and humiliation of eir first gynecological exam), and eir experiences of trying to help eir family understand eir identity.The thing that I appreciated the most about this memoir is that it portrays so painfully accurately the experience of what it‚Äôs like to have an identity outside of binary norms of any kind. There are no models for what is ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and so many of Kobabe‚Äôs feelings and thoughts do not fit into any known framework.I would highly recommend this book even if reading about gender and sexuality aren‚Äôt high on your interest lists.

Maia is so straightforward and raw as e describes eir childhood into early adulthood, and eir constant discomfort with being A.F.A.B. - assigned female at birth. But e doesn't really want to be a boy, either -- e just wants to be gender-free. And nothing in our culture really lets em, or anyone, be that way. The personal detail and unflinching honesty of Maia's journey is both really touching, and a little hard to read because some of it is so painful. This book is a great resource for anyone sharing that experience -- you're not alone! It's also a great resource for everyone. Whether or not we're aware of it, all of us probably know someone who is genderqueer, or gender uncomfortable, and this book provides so much insight into what drives that person and what they might be experiencing. I know a number of genderqueer folk, and most of them probably don't really want to tell me this amount of personal and intimate detail about themselves. So reading this provides me with a deeper level of understanding and empathy without having to be intrusive or out of bounds. And it's made me extra determined to use people's chosen pronouns and identify them as they wish to be seen. Highly recommended.Show more"

Under US law, providing pornography or obscene material, including drawings or cartoons, to a minor is illegal. Encouraging or aiding a minor to partake in a prohibited act or delinquent activity is also a crime. This book not only contains sexually explicit images of minors and adults, it also directly encourages and helps minors access porn, which is illegal. Among other things, the book shows high schoolers talking about how much they like erotic fiction and porn. On page 157, the book actually lists the site ""kink.com"" which is a porn site. Providing this book to a minor or offering it in a school library could be prosecuted as a crime. The screenshots you see on reviews are very mild compared to the book itself. The book contains images of masturbation, nudity, oral sex, use of sex toys, sex acts involving adults and minors. The story itself is a sad depiction of the author's childhood of neglect and deliberate gender confusion by parents. The author appears to suffer from intellectual disability, not learning to read until age 11, not having a phone or learning to drive until age 21, not understanding basic information such as the use of deodorant or that a 3rd grade girl shouldn't take off her shirt in public. Buying or reading this book feels like exploitation of a vulnerable person with disabilities.There are two chapters about the trauma of routine women's medical exams--enough to encourage young women to avoid these life-saving tests which are awkward but not painful for the vast majority of women.The underlying message of the book is that sex is both everything and nothing and that people need to experiment and discover what gender they are.

Additionally, I wished there was more exploration of this person's character beyond purely sexual aspects, as I believe that the societal obstacles imposed on individuals based on their gender identity are superficial and nonsensical.Perhaps this person needs to take a break from focusing on their sexual orientation and start working on developing themselves as a whole person.

I knew that, since it's been banned a lot of places and because I work with students and in a library, eventually this topic would be brought up and so I wanted to be informed. I've come to the conclusion that the reasons people are upset about this book on a large scale are the wrong reasons to not like this book. The author identifies as nonbinary and this is an adult memoir about that experience. That isn't a reason for the book to be vilified and people who are pretending it is are overreacting. Also want to note that this review will contain spoilers and also the author uses Spivak pronouns (e/em/eir), so I will use those when referring to em. My reasons for disliking this book is that, to start, there wasn't really a ""plot."" Memoirs usually follow even a loose timeline and this one felt like it jumped around a lot and like there wasn't a greater point to them. It felt kind of like a collection of short stories made into a graphic novel. So I wasn't a super big fan of that. Additionally, the author admitted to many strange behaviors for an adult in this book, which made me uncomfortable. These include:-writing sexual fanfiction about One Direction while they were still teenagers and e was in grad school-buying a sex toy, deciding e didn't like it, washing it and then regifting it to a sibling üòê That story gave me the ""Lena Dunham's rock story"" vibes and made me so uncomfortable. That's too close for family. -mentioning Plato's Symposium in a sexual fashion and then drawing a picture of it on a vase, which depicts an adult man and a much younger (read: probably teenage and therefore a minor) male engaging in sex. There are books about this situation where the point is to condemn the behavior. I felt very weirded out by that panel, especially because the point was for it to be sexual.-The repeated refrain of ""wanting to cut off my boobs"". I have no issue with top surgery. If that's what's needed for a person to feel most comfortable in their body or in life, you do you. But I feel like the wording for this could have been worded so as not to give an example for TERFs and right-wing extremists to point at and claim that people are ""indoctrinating"" their kids to ""mutilate"" themselves. -portraying a medical treatment in a graphically traumatic way. I understand this book has won an Alex award and has crossover appeal for teens. Due to that, many teens with a uterus may read this before they go see an OBGYN and that could make what is a relatively routine procedure traumatic or cause anxiety. I understand the need to explain how it made em feel and that e had such bad anxiety that e needed anxiety meds for the appointment, but cervical cancer screenings aren't something to play around with. It's necessary, even if you don't like it, for health reasons. Honestly, I am of the opinion that this book was kind of middle of the road and that it probably wouldn't have been as hyped if it weren't for TERFs overreacting ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm happy for people who feel seen in this book. I'm glad you're getting representation because that's important. I also want to note that there was a really good illustration used to explain what being nonbinary or trans felt like that I think would make it easier for cis people to understand. But I don't think that outweighs the lack of plot and other questionable moments in this book. I'm not the target audience, so I just want to be clear that I know it wasn't written with me in mind, but I read and love a lot of books that aren't ""for"" me. I think there are other books about the trans or nonbinary experience I would recommend before this one.Show more"

From a young age, Kobabe rejected traits and societal expectations that highlighted eir gender assigned at birth. But transgender didn‚Äôt quite fit the bill either. So where does that leave em? Kobabe‚Äôs memoir takes readers on eir journey of self-discovery and how ey navigate the world as a non-binary person.I really wish works like this had existed when I was a kid/teenager. I‚Äôm a cis woman, but my gender expression was something that was often on my mind as a child. From the ages of 9 to 14/15, I only shopped for clothing in the boys section of the clothing store and vehemently despised anything that made me look like a girl. (To this day, I buy a lot of men‚Äôs clothing, but also love makeup - this looks to a mostly femme, but kind of adrogynous look.) This led to many accusations of being a lesbian (though I was a dormant bi girl, unbeknowst to me) or transgender. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with either of those things, obviously, but having some kind of media to demonstrate to me that expressing your gender in a way that deviates from the norm is okay and can mean a myriad of different things about your gender/sexuality would have been really comforting for me as a young person. This small, personal connection really drew me to this work. Kobabe does an amazing job of talking about eir life and personal journey with their gender identity while also laying out the foundations of gender theory to people who might not be 100% aware of them. It makes for a great reading experience for people no matter their level of knowledge on these subjects. I like to think that I‚Äôm generally knowledgeable on these topics, but I still learnt a lot from Kobabe and am really grateful for eir willingness to put this personal story out in the world.

The book follows the non-binary author's journey with gender and sexuality. Although there is other subject matter in this book, gender and queerness (hence the title) are without a doubt the main themes of this book. Genderqueer is actually the first book I'm reading for a YouTube video covering the top list of banned books in America. Book banning is not an attempt to ""protect"" children- it is an attempt to erase marginalized people's stories and create an America that will soon rival fascist states of the past if we are not careful. That being said, to ""ban"" a book is absurd and an insult on education and literature. Censorship of literature is never okay, regardless of the subject matter. In this instance, however, there is a point to be made about who exactly should be reading this book, because like everything- subject matter and the age of the person reading is complex. It is not wrong to say that some works are not meant for a younger audience, however, that doesn't mean schools and politicians should act like Nazis and ban a book entirely because they cannot handle the thought of a child being exposed to something about sex, queerness, transness, race, etc. Believe me, many children in this country are exposed to worse things on a day to day basis than this author's somewhat sexual themes in the book (wherein almost all of them present a purpose of de-stigmatizing the topics of sex and bodies for a younger audience. Something that is sorely missing in most schools or even in at-home discussions.) I say this not to negate the argument of what age demographic should be reading this book, but rather to point to an obvious statement: a book is not the end of the world. The crux of the matter is that books are one of the only source of media where we can truly be put in another's shoes. This is one of the reasons as to why they are so often banned. Before reading this book, even as a trans man, I felt this unconscious judgement of Maia Kobabe due to eir choice of pronouns, yet by the end of the book, I found that we had so much in common, and I truly related to many of eir experiences. Genderqueer would have 100% helped me as a kid. It's themes surrounding sex, masturbation, gender, and attraction (topics that children- straight and cis as well- do have a personal understanding of, albeit in different scales of depth) were generally well explored and I found myself laughing out loud during particularly relatable moments, or reflecting on moments in my life that were brought up through Kobabe's experiences. Reading a book does not ""make you trans/gay"", it makes you see what was already there, which is what politicians does not want kids to see. Other than my personal feelings, I enjoyed a lot of the literary language used by Kobabe, and many of the illustrations as well. It is clear that e loves eir family, which was heartwarming to read about. The book was also very honest- almost to a fault at points, but I'll get into that in a moment- and it takes a lot of courage to talk about your experiences with sex and gender in such a raw way, let alone as a person who is part of the LGBTQ community.Now, although this book started off pretty strong for me, I found myself wanting more towards the end. The main issue I had with this book was the writing specifically (since we all know that not everything that is a cartoon is for children. See: South Park.) In reading this, it is obvious that the book is meant for a younger audience. While I recognize that age-limits on media are suggestions and entirely subjective, some of the subject matter honestly would go right over a kid's head who hasn't at least hit puberty. The thing is, I don't think that the author ever once made it seem as though that this book is for kids in the damn single-digits. Not only would they not understand most of the concepts in the book, but the sex scenes in the book, while helpful for trans/queer kids, are also not entirely suitable for very young kids. It is so subjective, though. Putting a cap on who and when they can read this is absurd. The resources should be there for a kid to do with it as they wish. Children are one of the most under-protected groups in society, and while conservatives refuse to admit it, they have minds of their own. Other than that- straight up- so many things were narratively just left hanging. Why did e not have a phone until e were 21? Why did e not know how to read in elementary school? There were many problems introduced that were seemingly never resolved, and it irked me.My final thing that I'd like to say about this book is that the amount of hate the author has received on it is atrocious. There are absolutely ""problematic"" (for lack of a better term) things that e include in this book, and things that should've been explored better/more, however, it is obvious that half of the people who are writing hateful reviews on this book have not even read it. I am not surprised in the slightest. The one-star reviews are filled with conservatives who drank one too many Corona's (Bud Light is cancelled) and decided to make an entire Goodreads account just to lie about the subject matter of this book, blatantly misgender the author, and spew the classic rotten diarrhea talking points from their every orifice in their review. One reviewer claimed that their were ""graphic depictions"" of oral sex between two minors, which I clearly failed to notice. For some reason, I am not too concerned with making up fake scenarios in my head about kids having sex. In fact, there were only a handful of ""sex scenes."" I wouldn't even call them that since they were far from graphic, and served their purpose in terms of narratively. My bad, though, I did happen to actually read the book. There is absolutely a discussion to be had about the many complexities of what children are consuming and whatnot, but these conversations are nearly impossible to be had when book banning is becoming more rampant with each passing year, leading the discussion into a ""is book bad or good"" vs ""why this book might be good but also bad but also okay for some audiences but also not for others."" Rational discussions are becoming nonexistent in a world where marginalized people's voices are constantly under attack, and where criticism is not even about the subject matter in said media, but is instead on an entirely different plane of existence where POC, trans, gay, Indigenous, whatever, is bad, and white man and woman reproducing for the white race is good! These people (democrats and republicans, sorry to break it to you) fear what challenges their worldview, be it socialism, Black culture, decolonization, etc, and will do anything to stop who so dares to challenge it.‚úÇÔ∏é----------check me out on other platforms!

They're truly horrible -- I just reported a large number of them as abusive -- so don't read them if it's going to trigger you. I need to go find my cat and some fluffy nonsense now)4.5 starsThis was fantastic, and I would recommend it to literally everyone.It's hard to write this review without slipping into a philosophical ramble on gendered societies, but that is not AT ALL what this graphic novel is. It's a very personal story about one individual's experience, and Maia is so open and frank about eir experience, especially the confusion surrounding adolescence/puberty/sex, that I'm kinda blown away by the bravery.¬†I know I've got a few stories from that period of my¬†life that I can't even think about without cringing, and the thought of sharing them with the world is HORRIFYING!!! But I think that's what elevates this into something truly special. The more details means the more people who can find a link to their own experiences, and then at the same time, the¬†more we can truly appreciate how very different everyone's individual experience can be. Maia hits a tone here that is so free of judgment, both of emself and those around em whose words had a negative impact without meaning to, that it feels strikingly, beautifully objective.And the thing that makes Maia relatively lucky -- the fact that e grew up in a liberal, non-conforming family, in a liberal town, in a liberal school in the 90s and 2000s (and then went to a fine arts college in San Francisco with at least one non-binary professor) -- also really lets this be almost purely about gender expression. There are countless microaggressions, but there's no hate here. There's no -phobia.¬†And yet, in this incredibly open, ""progressive"" environment, there is still hardly anyone who has any idea how to handle non-binary gender confusion.¬†For me, as a cisgendered person who can read this from a relatively objective state of mind, that in itself makes a pretty profound statement. For so many others it's an amazing opportunity to realize they're not alone. And for everyone in between it's just a really impressive piece of storytelling.I had no idea one could get a master's in comics, but this is definitely the level of work I would expect to come from such a thing :) It's so well-done that it's hard to imagine this story being told as effectively in any other format.Read it, read it, read it, read it, read it.

One article, paraphrasing the complaints noted it is seen as ""gratuitously sexual and unnecessary for school children"" (North Cook News, 2021, para. 6). In a novel, the sex would be a paragraph. It is a graphic novel, though, so it's somewhat more graphic than a similar novel (i.e., fellating a dildo strap on). There are also some penises, some penis stand-ins, a vibrator, and some bed scenes (with the characters more than 6"" apart). All of these are quickly set aside. The uproar, of course, is less about the sex and more the sympathetic discussion of gender identity issues. Maia Kobabe offers a nuanced and accessible memoir for exploring self and coming out. Kobabe feels neither only male nor female, and describes eir journey ‚Äì eir pronouns are e/eir/em ‚Äì to recognizing and accepting self as a gendered being. E identifies as bisexual, but also admits to being largely asexual, thinking at one point, ""I'd bet I'm less than half as interested in boys and girls combined than you are in boys alone. LOL, maybe not even 25%"" (p. 134).Kobabe's ambivalence about sex and eir gender ‚Äì and eir willingness to give this ambivalence voice ‚Äì is part of what makes Gender Queer an interesting graphic novel. In general, the drawings are less complex and three-dimensional than those I most like in graphic novels (e.g., 
Fun Home
 and 
My Favorite Thing is Monsters
). Eir story is layered and often painful rather than simple. And, it is punctuated by joyful and somewhat more complex images.I'm not comfortable having children and teens see open depictions of sex ‚Äì but I remember reading books with more graphic descriptions when I was a teen. If reading Gender Queer makes it easier for one child to admit being asexual; to accurately identify as trans, gay, or bi; or to be able to make it through to the other side on these issues, then Gender Queer has been successful and well worth any discomfort it inadvertently causes. If it makes it easier for children, teens, and adults to accept these differences among their friends and family members, kudos!Images are from Gender Queer.Show more"

It's a horror show- so here's an objective review by a nonbinary person. As always, content warnings are at the end of my review, and this one is going to be a long one!2.5? My thoughts are mixed, I went in with the context that this book has been in the spotlight under intense vitriol in tandem with political tirades against trans children, trans adults, and trans representation as a whole. Like any review, I'm approaching it critically, especially as someone who is trans and cares about good writing and fulfilling representation, without misgendering the nonbinary author Maia Kobabe 
(e/em/eir pronouns)
 and being a total bigot. I thought the book was ok, I didn't fall in love, but I certainly didn't loathe it, and I did really enjoy some parts though some parts I really didn't care for. It's a mixed bag that's hard to come away with much from aside like feeling that you've read someone's private diary, very akin to We Both Laughed in Pleasure: The Selected Diaries of Lou Sullivan (My Review) but with less of a message aside from representation. This is a gender and sexuality scrapbook of Maia Kobabe's experience understanding eir feelings and sharing eir experiences as e comes to understand who e is in regards to eir complex identities. We follow em from childhood through adulthood in a not completely linear form, the book actually opening with the context that e wrote parts of what became Gender Queer for a class and was actually ashamed of the autobiographical project, covering it up with blank pages- so it opens as e rips the coverings off to reveal the title. From there we get a varied collection of eir experiences of exploration through school, family, friends, college, fandom, dating, self expression and more. Similar to Gumballs (My Review) the pacing extremely varies between multiple page cohesive stories and one page comics, jumping through topics rapidly, but the central theme being about the author, more so here in Gender Queer than in Gumballs which is a perk. The back describes it as a ""TOUCHING GUIDE"", but there wasn't really anything to support this claim that guided the reader towards anything? That ended up being my issue with it is it was not a guide as much as a selection of random thoughts and memories not a complete narrative, just providing a very individual experience with gender and sexuality. It's extremely different than my read prior, First Year Out: A Transition Story (My Review), and its extreme focus on sticking just to transitional facts and trans education, leaving no story left behind. This book is instead on the opposite extreme, rich with character of who Maia is, e being the story emself, making it incredibly intimate and personal, but like a diary, there isn't really a goal let alone a conclusive ending. In fact, the ending felt incredibly abrupt, leaving in what felt like the middle of a story without any closing statements about eir identity, eir growth, or a resolution of any kind.I see how it stirs controversy from all angles, but the book itself really just reads as a product from the 2010s tumblr fandom culture, those who lived through it will catch many of Maia's references, but those and others won't see any progression from it. The title needs some more emphasis on the memoir portion to ensure readers get this is one experience under the genderqueer umbrella, and memoir doesn't really cover how broadly this book covers eir life.Book Banning:For those of you who don't know, Gender Queer has been the most banned and challenged book noted by the American Library Association for the last two years. I'm going to run through some common reasons it gets challenged so severely, as well as some issues I have with the book. - Casual misogyny by calling it ""vaginal slime,""How to say you talk like a textbook your entire life... No, seriously, engage with any human being or media and tell me if they strictly use medical and anatomical terms for bodily functions and parts. This is just anti-trans hypocrisy. Do you call menstrual cycles periods? Do you call fecal matter poop? Do you call saliva spit? Well, I guess you're incorrect too!  - Issues are really common to girls going through puberty and adolescence/#notlikeotherwomen/‚Äúit‚Äôs not about being male, it‚Äôs more about not being female.‚ÄùYou didn't read the book. Maia always goes on to elaborate that it's not just traumatic to menstruate, uncomfortable developing breasts, and embarrassing growing leg hair, but it's also eir relationship with eir body and gender identity itself. E is nonbinary, and describes feeling like having a soul that is half a man and half a woman, wishing e had a long lost twin who was a boy who longed to be a girl so e could be a complete picture. The anti-trans folks really hate the scale metaphor Kobabe uses for eir gender, but I understand it in a slightly amended way. Eir scale has birth assigned sex on one side always tipping the scale, so e uses different aspects of transition to balance the scale. You could see it as rather than just sex assignment, but that's dysphoria, of social assumptions and personal discomforts, and the other side is what e is doing to alleviate and manage dysphoria. People often forget (or chose to) forget how social gender is, and how that plays into our comforts and preferences, and especially in the context of being nonbinary in a society that forces you into boxes, this balance of finding a middle ground is complex. This is what e means by eir quote, e is ""femaled"" heavily, and doesn't want to be a man, but to be genderless, so e is trying to balance that scale both mentally and socially. - Your feminist lesbian aunt is right, this is a movement that is misogynisticHonestly, the book sets up anyone on the fence or anti-trans to throw a fit here. Maia's aunt fights with em about respecting eir gender and pronouns because she believes transmasculine identities are just extreme internalized misogyny, Maia is taken aback, then we jump forward to hours later and eir aunt is now supportive after an off screen conversation. E does go on afterwards to unpack this explaining e always felt neither being a man or woman fit, always wanting a third option. Then e goes on to use brain science to affirm this, which I will get more into later.Isn't it misogynistic to assume someone transitions because they ""hate womanhood"" when they never claimed that, pushing blame on the victim of misogyny for not doing enough (this is what is implied by this example, becoming not a woman) in order to escape misogyny? This logic paints misogyny as something the victim has to fix, rather than a societal system built on demeaning femininity and womanhood. This logic also hilariously assumes that being a non-woman at least socially will help one escape misogyny entirely, erasing that someone who is transmasculine socially still needs abortion access, birth control, and other healthcare that's still being attacked. But I thought it was all about biology? It never was, it's always just been whatever will take trans people down! With this logic there's no reason for trans women to exist, feminine cisgender men are treated as equals, and cis women can never be misogynistic- which anti-trans people would love you to believe, but it just isn't true. It is also incredibly white-centric theory, claiming that ""male privilege"" is an escape from subjugation ignores the systemic violence Black trans men face as they express masculinity. This is why ""radical feminism"" isn't feminism, it doesn't care about gender freedom or equality, but rigid protection of ideals to other those who are gender variant, gender nonconforming, and transgender.  - Nudity/sexual content/age appropriateness ""Kobabe imagined the memoir would appeal mainly to young adults who had also wrestled with gender identity, and to friends and family of nonbinary people. The book‚Äôs publisher, Lion Forge, marketed it toward older teens and adults. But it soon found a younger audience. In 2020, it won an Alex Award, a prize given by the American Library Association to books written for adults that hold ‚Äúspecial appeal to young adults, ages 12 through 18.""... Currently, on Amazon, it‚Äôs listed as appropriate for ages 18 and up; on Barnes & Noble‚Äôs website, it‚Äôs recommended for readers 15 and older."" - The New York TimesSo, Kobabe wrote this for an 18-25 age range, and the recommended age varies greatly from there based on what is inside. What we see is: Shirtless babies, a fairly normal occurrence. Maia in third grade shirtless wearing swim shorts, as seen on the cover of the first edition. A scene of two nude men kissing roughly from the waist up, no genitals or nipples are seen, just the tops of one man's buttocks. Maia as e grows up shirtless, but from the shoulders up, eir chest not shown. Maia from the front fully naked as e changes into a robe for a pap smear. A reference and name drop of a pornography company online. Multiple references to romantic and erotic shipping. Maia's sister asks em if e has tasted eir own discharge, e says no, sister tells em to try it- some people mix this up as e trying eir sister's and not almost trying eir own, I was able to understand this without clarification, but it could have been more clear. A scene where Maia buys a vibrator, dislikes it, and after cleaning it gives it to eir sister. Clothed masturbation. Maia's partner buys em a strap on sex toy and e wears it and eir partner preforms oral sex on it for 2 panels. Finally, the last graphic depiction I'll cover more below. - ‚Äúan elaborate fantasy based on Plato‚Äôs symposium‚Äù/real life ships/ wincestThis book features the quote above as well as a depiction of young Maia happily imagining a scene drawn in Greek pottery style of a nude bearded figure (presumably Pausanias) holding the penis of a smaller figure. With the context in mind, Pausanias in Plato's symposium praises paiderastia (socially acknowledged romantic relationship between an older male and a younger male usually in his teens), thus making the image a depiction of historical art that is very likely immoral. The art alone raises concern, as well as the added fact young Maia is enjoying the idea. What the issue is, readers are unsure why Kobabe included it, does e condone relationships like this, does e want to discuss how minors can be attracted to maturity without understanding the danger of relationships with a power dynamic such as that, does e prefer fantasy/intellect to more traditional fantasies? The last explanation is really the only one matching with the context, as it appears amid em discussing eir asexuality, but there's really no clarification provided to its inclusion. Alone, this already sparks discussion, but there's more depictions of questionable and concerning sexual fantasy and expression. In college we see Maia ships Sam and Dean Winchester, the leading brother duo of the show Supernatural, and in grad school we see em read and write erotic fanfiction for the real life members of the One Direction band. This really harkens back to SuperWhoLock tumblr fandoms, where often ""anything goes"" was the law of the land, but attitudes in fandom spaces have changed signifignatly. E talks about writing this in 2014 so all of the band members were at least 20 at the time, Maia being at least 24, so the concern is not age, but is it appropriate to write erotic stories about real life people without their knowledge or consent? Maia depicts all of these as aspects of em understanding eir asexuality with little to no reflection, and certainly no critical reflection on the morality of any occurrences.  - Brain science/autoandrophilliaAs I mentioned before there's not much nonfictional guidance, it's mostly personal experience, but this is an outlier as Maia cites Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain for multiple pages to affirm that eir gender is a biological fact through development of the brain... Which is hottly contested and often considered so minimal that it is irrelevant and not indicative of anything. ""Men and women's brains do differ slightly, but the key finding is that these distinctions are due to brain size, not sex or gender. Sex differences in the brain are tiny and inconsistent, once individuals' head size is accounted for... The truth is that there are no universal, species-wide brain features that differ between the sexes. Rather, the brain is like other organs, such as the heart and kidneys, which are similar enough to be transplanted between women and men quite successfully."" - Dr. Lise EliotIn the case of autoandrophillia, this is a brother concept by Ray Blanchard made to mirror his greatly inaccurate and debunked theory of autogynephillia, which he went on to say regarding autoandrophillia ""I proposed it simply in order not to be accused of sexism [...] I don't think the phenomenon even exists."" Which says a lot about how haphazardly his theories are formed. So, for e to identify with a known form of anti-trans pathologization (Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity came out in 2007, which rips Blanchard a new one) is ignorant at the kindest interpretation, and actively dangerous without any context and clarification as Maia leaves it in the text. At this point e knew about trans, nonbinary, and genderqueer topics, so it's odd to say that then and even odder to keep it in with nothing to elaborate and disavow Blanchard. - The GynecologistSo twice in the book Maia visits a gynecologist, and both times it goes pretty horribly for em. It is incredibly painful to an extreme degree, leading em to picture it as em impaled through the stomach with a bloody implement, with the second time causing a breakdown when the speculum comes out with blood on it. This becomes a weird intersection of trying to encompass eir experience while also understanding the populations e is speaking to. Yes, it could alienate young women who are afraid of such an invasive and embarrassing procedure, but they will have other women and women focused resources to reassure them. Trans people do not have that liberty, so presenting this to them without any further clarification, tips, or knowledge on what pap smears and pelvic exams entail can cause catastrophic harm on a population already terrified and isolated regarding a life saving exam. Even specifying more on what causes eir pain, or disclosing not even a name but a sign that it originates from a medical condition, could help to reassure vulnerable readers that this won't be the end of the world.Summary:Readability: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ, Sexuality, transphobia, and periods, and blood come up enough or in graphic enough ways that could deter readers severely. Maia struggled greatly with periods, being left to free bleed which is depicted, as well as the unhygienic bathrooms e tried to avoid drawn filled with blood and feces, a drawing of a pad that e wore for so long the blood dried, bleeding through clothes, and blood covering eir legs. Text and format alone though were really easy to blast through, the brain science quotes aside.Entertainment: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ, 2.5? I like the art a lot, the style and colors really worked for me! It was nice to see an ace and enby story, but there's really not enough clarification when Maia makes some bizarre choices or poor descriptions which leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Nice example of consent too!Audience: Late teens and young adults, I don't think this would work for anyone below high school because it is fairly graphic. I wouldn't be inclined to hand this to new allies or people on the fence either for the same reason. I think it speaks most to those who had a hard time labeling themselves, and those wanting to see a transition develop. It's ok, I wouldn't consider it a must read, but I think some people could enjoy this.Content Warnings: alcoholism, anxiety, blood, confusion, dysphoria, fanfiction about real people, feces, graphic violence, harry potter, homophobia, impaling, incest shipping, injections, masturbation, nudity, oral sex, ostracization, pap smear, periods, porn mention, sex, sex toy, shipping real people, strap on, transphobia, unhygienic habits, unsafe binding, urination, vulgarityShow more"

It‚Äôs been the subject of lots of talk, both high praise and scathing condemnation, which made me curious.2). I was interested to learn more about what ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù means.I found the author‚Äôs story did indeed help me to better understand the non-binary experience. I especially found useful the section that discusses how a person‚Äôs physical gender and brain gender could be mismatched even during fetal development (though I suppose that is not the only reason some may be/feel non-binary). I also felt empathy for the author‚Äôs struggles at self-identification -- trying to find words that fit eir internal experience -- and at communicating them with the external world. Kobabe grew up in a household that seems incredibly open to discussions about and variations in gender (her sister is queer; her aunt was an open lesbian before the author‚Äôs birth) but even so had difficulties finding understanding and acceptance with all eir burgeoning beliefs and needs.A few parts of the book I felt strayed into ‚Äúoversharing‚Äù territory, and I would have been fine not knowing or seeing them, but, hey, it‚Äôs eir memoir, not mine. I‚Äôm very happy our society is far removed from the Victorian Era‚Äôs repressed sexuality, but I guess I haven‚Äôt yet embraced the 21st-century ‚Äúeveryone share EVERYTHING with everyone else‚Äù mentality either. In some ways, the book is like any other coming-of-age story (and, in that sense, sometimes a little boring to this 62-year-old who in his life has encountered myriad such ‚ÄúWho am I and how do I fit in the world?‚Äù stories, including his own). A lot of the problems/conflicts the author experiences are universal, e.g., ‚ÄúThis whole dating thing is making me more and more confused and less and less happy‚Äù (170). These feelings --and many others found in the book -- could be expressed any young adult (or full-fledged adult, for that matter) -- straight/gay/bi, male/female/non-binary -- at some point in their lives. Although the particulars of Kobabe‚Äôs story are unique, the generalities should feel familiar to most readers.Show more"

I'm glad it exists and the art is serviceable, but Kobabe has an energy at points that feels really... I'm not sure, incurious, I guess?

I've done this interrogation of my own feelings, over and over again, first as what I thought was a cis woman and later as trans, and the sense that Kobabe hadn't really done that made the whole book less effective for me. Every moment of one's life cannot make it into memoir, but to see the question raised and remain unanswered felt like a big miss.Also, not to be crass but if any potential partner said to me on like, a first date, ""Your pussy juices disgust me, is that a dealbreaker?""

It has frank depictions of the body, of periods, of pap smears, of sex and I‚Äôm just not used to it. But do all these depictions service the story? They absolutely do.Maia Kobabe has written and drawn a wonderful graphic novel about how hard it can be for queer people to find their identity. And for people assigned female at birth, part of finding their identity will just about always involve periods, pap smears, and partners. Maia just had the courage to discuss these things and eir feelings about these things frankly.This was the most challenged book of 2022 (according to ALA) and will likely remain frequently challenged for the foreseeable future. Is this book appropriate for kids? Probably not little kids, no. Is it appropriate for teens? I think so, though it always depends on the teen. But to try to ban this book and keep it out of the hands of every teen is despicable. I can‚Äôt help but think about all the bloody violent graphic novels and manga aimed at boys that no one has a problem with, but you find one book with period blood and a (almost fully-clothed) sex scene, and suddenly we have a society-wide existential crisis.Anyway, good book that won‚Äôt take you long. The structure is a bit all over the place but I think it‚Äôs fine for a book specifically about identity.

Kobabe reveals little meaningful things i have not seen in other trans and nonbinary memoirs. An example of this; Eir years of dressing like a teenage boy to symbolically underscore eir message to the world that ey were not a girl despite loving florals and colors, and eir subsequent choice to model eir taste rather than a binary gender expression when making decisions about appearance. Another example, the description of sexual fantasies that always involved er having a penis. The writer was candid and made emselves vulnerable here, and the illustrations were quite good. I can't say I enjoyed the read exactly, I was sort of pissed at Kobabe's hippie free-range parents throughout. I applaud letting your child grow as they will, but that is not the same as withholding all guidance and rules. They never made Maia learn to read -- e finally did when e was 11! It was clear that they abdicated their responsibility to equip their children for life (oddly I am having the same reaction while simultaneously reading Melissa Febos' Girlhood and it is getting in the way for me there too.) Had Kobabe been given the tools to function in a world with other people I expect e would have had a less lonely and painful journey to learning who e was. Had they ever asked questions about Maia's life and how e was feeling e would have the lived experience of expressing who e was, rather than having to stress while figuring out how to discuss eir identity with strangers. Obviously this is not a problem with the book. I am sure it is an honest representation, but it bugged me. I liked the part where Maia's lesbian aunt expresses a bit of anger that Maia identifying as nonbinary is based on a dislike or rejection of women. I admit I have an issue with this too (though not so much with identifying as nonbinary as in identifying as trans.) When I say that I do not mean that I have any interest in telling people how to identify, or any right to do so. I am just saying there is no one way to be a woman or a man. Saying ""I feel like a wo/man"" or ""I have always known I was a wo/man"" endorses the message that there is a right way to be based upon gender identification. In a lot of ways it endorses the gender binary or a concept of wholly physiological gender. It seems like a slap at women who identify as female but display typically masculine characteristics (from the drawing it appears Kobabe's aunt fits in that group) and of men who identify as male but present more traditionally effeminate appearance or behaviors. I was glad e raised this but wish e had addressed it other than to say e knew that what her aunt said was not correct. Why is it not correct? I don't know scads of people who identify as trans or nonbinary, but over the years I have know several such people, and currently I know a couple well enough to have discussions of this sort, and when I have asked this question (doesn't being trans endorse the concept of gender as a static and biological thing with a narrow set of rules) I always get blown off. This is something I want to better understand which is why I am so glad Maia addressed it, but I wish e had just not raised and dismissed it.I read this for the Read Harder challenge for the prompt to read a book with an asexual character. but learned about it from the Book Riot folks list of books for another challenge, read a memoir by a trans or nonbinary person. It was a good decision.Show more"

It's not written to titillate, but to discuss the different ways in which the author had sex while working around eir gender issues.

I had fairly skewed expectations as I came in with only one preconceived notion: some straight, white, churchy folks were upset by the idea of this book. You cannot imagine my surprise reading this incredibly thoughtful, gentle, tame book. Maia Kobabe (who uses e/em/eir pronouns) simply created a memoir of eir experiences growing up... that's it. It's one individual's story told through the lens it was perceived. I've read several graphic memoirs and plenty of non-graphic autobiographical books and this was far from the wildest or most shocking. I'm so deeply disappointed in a culture that wants to sensationalize a single person sharing the experiences ey had growing up trying to make sense of eir place in the world. There was a lot of noise made about nothing in my opinion. Maia is a wonderful artist who imbued this with a lot of life and personality. The story telling was easy to follow, even when the topics weren't and there was a lot of honesty here from someone who has seemingly struggled with that most of eir life. It feels to me like people who don't know how to talk about sex or gender were terrified of anyone in their lives reading this book and needing/wanting to talk about sex or gender. I'm sorry for the way they were raised and that they stopped trying to evolve as individuals in their adulthood. That seems like a hard way to live in the world we have now, but that's on you. This was so mild and reasonable in view of Maia's life experiences that I'm just mad it was ever a conversation. Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010150-malola,Gender Queer,Rating 2 out of 5,"June 29, 2021",7 likes,0,"Well, let's start with the good.E (fine... I'll use Spivack) draws really well, to the point, eir written lines are properly exposed. E clearly has formal education in comics. (Yes, I was also surprised that a Masters in Comics -or whatever its called- exists.) The bad? (Is it 'bad' really?) Incoherent? (It has a fine structure, though.) Nonsensical? (It makes sense, but I just don't know what to do with the premises nor the conclusions.) I don't even know what term to use for the content. It's not bad, really, it's just... I don't know what to think of it. It sounds so... IDK... outlandish. Almost otherworldly.I just struggle to understand the whole non-binary thing. I accept the premise that being gender non-conforming is a real thing, but somewhere along the graphic novel I thought the whole thing was just 'too much'. I don't understand the link between feeling 'happy' and the Spivak's pronouns. Why is singular ""they/them"" not good enough? Is it the sound? The 'uniqueness' or uncommonness?Not that it's necessarily ontologically wrong (though, e gives NO ontology whatsoever, just some quotes from Churchland, but fine... it's a memoir, not an academic book)... I mean, we do create many fictions that get objectivised if they reach certain standards, it's that I don't find it useful at all. Do we 'really' need all those identities? Maybe. But I fail to see how. (Yes, I'm aware it's not my place to tell someone else how to identify. At the same time it's not my obligation to even acknowledge certain things I disagree with.) Would I use such pronouns if someone asks me to? Yes, I don't see any reason why not. I'm literally using Spivak's while writing this. Does it even have a purpose aside from the subjective experience of a very small group of people? Well...Aside from that, the second half was just so effing mellow. (The first half was fine.) Like if e's world is made out of candy and rainbows which was just too annoying for my taste.I think eir point was to make it like a guide/reference book... kind of like Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo, and Me by Ellen Forney, but it just lacks information. Marbles quotes from several academic books on depression and bipolar disorder and from memoirs of artists struggling with mental health. (So she gives both: descriptions of subjective experiences aside from her own AND objective information on bipolar disorder.) Forney makes a point on the necessity she had to understand her own condition in an objective way. (And help the mentally healthy reader to understand how reality is for someone who is bipolar.) Mostly because she needed to rationalise the idea that after a 'down', an 'up' would come and viceversa, hence she needed to plan ahead in order not to let her mood swings take over... and not feel discouraged when the drugs were not helping and so on. Meanwhile Kobabe seems to be mostly uncomfortable with emself, but e makes no real attempt to understand eir condition in a rational, objective way. (Except from Touching A Nerve, she doesn't mention any science whatsoever.) E's just happy that Facebook has new ways to identify oneself. I guess 'good for FB and Kobabe!', but again, it does nothing for me (a cissexual/cisgender human being) to help me understand which is supposed to be the point of the book. (The other goal of the book seems to be making non-conforming people feel less alone/not alone... which I'll have to read from them to see if the book reaches that objective, but so far I don't have reasons to believe it doesn't.)Anyways, the whole thing reads like a very subjective memoir that wants to help cis people understand, but completely fails to ground itself in real knowledge. Oh, yeah... And people who claim the ending was too abrupt are right.Show more"

A person is willingly choosing to share and expose their/eirs lives to the world and their/eirs struggles. There's always this underlying tone of maybe wanting someone out there to not feel alone and isolated, or for having any form of representation, or of teaching someone that things are broad and diverse and that we can go a long with an extra bit of kindness and understanding. Not all of them are like that of course. But, with that said, graphic memoirs are my favorite type of memoirs and I love how this category is expanding!This is a story about Maia's struggle with gender, sexuality and everything that comes with it. From noticing the differences early on, to clothing, dating, relationships, body image, pronouns, the continuous process of coming out, finding people to be safe around, to having the difficult and awkward conversations..etc etc. There is a lot of emphasis on pronouns, having gender neutral pronouns, navigating that and trying to find peace. Maia uses E/Eir/Em, and these were new to me but hey, new words added to my vocabulary. There is so much packed in here and a lot that I have learned. E also talks about relying on books through the entire process of trying to understand what's happening. The type of books Maia mentions ranges across multiple genres and I'm just thinking how important that is and how a book like this could potentially be what someone turns to when going through their own self discovery whatever that may be or someone who just wants to learn. There was a page about Maia's reading statistics and the nerd in me was so happy about that, I kept looking at the genres and the numbers and I loved it.Things are changing so fast and sometimes it feels very overwhelming feeling that you have to learn everything, having to catch up and having to feel stupid sometimes too but at the same time it's wonderful knowing there's still so much to discover. There is a part in this book where Maia's cousin asks what should their new born call Maia when he grows up, and E responds (I'm paraphrasing) by saying I don't know maybe by then we'll have more gender neutral words for aunt and uncle. And with the pace of how the English language is changing and twisting, I'm sure one will exist.This was an interesting graphic memoir and enjoyable to read. Not really enjoyable seeing someone's struggle but I'm sure you get what I mean. I loved the illustration style, the coloring and the text's font. I think this might be a book I'll remember for a long time, can't say for sure as I have a memory of a fish but I have a feeling that it might just stick around in the corners of my brain.(I received a free e-book copy of this title from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)Show more"

I had no issues with the content of this book, 5/5 all around for how accessible the information on gender is compared to other works. I thought Kobabe's personality was wonderful and eir depiction of self didn't feel overblown or glamourized.The only reason for me this isn't 5* is I struggled with the form. There is no demarcation of chapters or topics, it just flows from beginning to end. I sometimes found it difficult to understand if the following page was related to the page before, or if a new idea was being presented. I wish there was some form of visual cue to let me know we'd switched thoughts. I had to flip back just to be sure we weren't still talking about the same thing, or in some cases to ensure I was correctly connecting the concepts.I also really loved reading a memoir from someone roughly my age range. The references to Harry Potter, One Direction, FanFic, and even more obscure ones such as to Kink.com being housed the SF Armoury gave me a real sense of connection to Kobabe in a way I've not found with some other [Queer] graphic memoirs.The best thing is it taught me something new. I was previously unaware of Spivak pronouns (e/em/eir)! I also loved the idea of evolutionary language brought up towards the end when eirs family asked what e'd like to be called instead of 'aunt.'

The only two questions I have after skimming through this is ""why would an ill woman want to impose her sick fantasy upon young, innocent children?"" and ""how can other people possibly endorse it, unless it is a completely sick society?"". There is nothing else to it. This book perfectly illustrates how quickly and how far our society has degraded. It is painful to think about the children that have to grow up in this disgusting era, reading derogatory pieces like this, instead of books written by the greatest authors, who tried to untangle the mysteries of life, find the meaning, or who tried to bring some miracles into reality. There is nothing to say, but sorry, to these innocent kids because their childhood ends without even beginning because they have to be fed with material like this, with pronouns, with gender confusion, and shamed for being normal... I feel so ashamed for the womankind, which has to bear the presence of women like the author. But what upsets me the most is that on Goodreads this piece is rated higher than the greatest novels ever written. Instead of urging kids to read the books that actually have a message, we incline them to take in a fantasy of a sick mind. This piece doesn't even deserve a zero.

The author uses uses e/em/eir pronouns, and this is a memoir of eir coming to terms with understanding and embracing who e is. Hope I got those pronouns right! There is much I hadn't considered explored here, and I appreciated the honesty of this memoir. I also really liked the illustration style, and this memoir would be a good one to read once you get your head around the fact that using a binary system is so early aughts.Show more"

While many strive to keep this book out of the hands of young people, those are the very hands it belongs in. Reading something doesn't create a person's gender identity. This book may actually help validate the many feelings young people have surrouding this issue. I think Kobabe does a great job taking the reader through the many different feelings e had as a young person, a teen and a twenty-something. It taught me that, like many things in life, this is something I thought I knew a lot about, but I actually only knew the tip of the iceberg.

This book is one of the notable books to ban from schools and public libraries.This book explains the turmoil a young female child endures growing up and not being comfortable in her body, yet, being labeled a female with that word as well as she, her, and a lady that society uses.Maia, an excellent professional cartoonist, truthfully and sincerely expresses in words and cartoons her experiences of confusion, fear, worry, anger, and love. As a reader, I felt those emotions, which is powerful writing. Since this is a graphic memoir, one page shows a sexual experience. (Two women having sex for the first time and one person wearing a strap-on penis while the other has it in the mouth.) As bad as this graphic sounds, when you read the memoir as you see it, there is a reason it took place and wasn‚Äôt completed, let alone enjoyed. The graphic is still not something any elementary student or immature child should be reading or seeing. However, this is NOT a pornography story. It‚Äôs one page, two graphic boxes, and that‚Äôs it. I do agree that this book should not be in elementary school libraries. Those students are too young and immature for this information. However, Gender Queer should exist in high school libraries, public libraries, bookshops, and stores. This book should be kept in high schools BECAUSE there are too many kids today with many mental health issues regarding how they feel about their identities. Some of these children have had problems since they were toddlers BUT have parents that don‚Äôt understand and become angry and demanding about their child(ren)‚Äôs behavior. The children grow up afraid to express anything they feel or think, keeping to themselves until they explode, possibly hurting others or ending up hurting themselves, even fatally. How about letting this book remain in high schools with social workers and guidance counselors?? The book can help with having a better understanding and knowing how to talk to children and or parents during meetings. We now live in a world where people do not and should not have to hide their feelings of wonderings, confusion, or certainty. There are some young children as early as two years old that start acting a certain way, such as a young female child wanting her hair cut very short and wearing clothes that make her look like a boy, even acting like a boy and vice versa. I know this from personal experience. My daughter was a two-year-old going on three fighting me when I dressed her in dresses and pretty pastel colors. Oh, the temper tantrums that took place. When she was five, I was living a nightmare with her. She took her older sister‚Äôs school scissors and chopped up her hair. I would dress her as a young girl, and she would pull her clothes off, trying to ruin them. I had her hair fixed at a salon, and it was shorter than her ears and close to a crew cut. I had to quit dressing her in dresses and pretty pastel colors. I had to succumb to dark-colored clothing on her, blue, brown, green, and black, to get her to school. She played sports which was not a problem, many young girls did, but she played like a competitive professional. At 13, she got her menstrual cycle and lost it. She begged to have every female organ removed, including her breast. Of course, this wasn‚Äôt happening, so now I was dealing with her suicide attempts. It wasn‚Äôt until she had her horrible accident at 13 years old, ending up with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a total loss of memory, that being a boy was forgotten. Now my daughter is a young girl learning life all over again and now wearing female clothing and colors with no fight. Her memory loss lasted seven months. Once her memory returned (she never got her short-term memory back due to frontal lobe damage), she went back to wearing her dark clothing, BUT on special occasions, she no longer fought dressing up as a young lady, and I didn‚Äôt force her. My daughter is a 29-year-old adult now married to a man and still dresses in dark clothing and colors; however, she dresses up for special occasions beautifully in dark colors. She only has one female friend and many male friends. She can compete against any male and changes her and her husband‚Äôs car brakes and oil, which amazes her husband and male friends. She refuses to have children, and her husband supports her decision. My point in sharing my daughter‚Äôs story is that this memoir reflected her growing up. I strongly feel if I had continued to force her to act like a young lady in her young years that, she would‚Äôve rebelled against me even worse, possibly succeeding with a suicide attempt or maybe even running away. If this book had been around for her younger years, it could have helped her AND me better understand what she was dealing with, which was so much confusion, just like Maia in her memoir. I appreciate this book and am glad Maia shared her life with readers. This book can help many open-minded parents better understand what their child(ren) is going through. Closed-minded parents will continue fighting to eliminate this book.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6769012-melanie,Gender Queer,Rating 2 out of 5,"September 8, 2022",6 likes,0,"After recently reading Abigail Shrier's Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters, it seemed fitting to read a book by someone, who, while no longer a teen, falls under the banner of genderfluidity and invented pronouns. This book is also widely banned for ""obscene depictions,"" so. It's a little early for Banned Books Week but close enough.I'll cut right to the chase: there are depictions of menstrual blood, shit in a toilet, masturbation while clothed, cervical mucus (way to show your casual misogyny by calling it ""vaginal slime,"" author) and a handful of depictions of dicks, the most graphic of those being a partner performing oral sex on a dildo sported by the author. It's up to a parent to gauge when seeing images like these are appropriate for their children, and my young teen is entirely not ready for images of strap-ons and fellation. I guess this book is supposed to be about Maia's profound journey into gender ambiguity, but honestly, a lot of her issues are really common to girls going through puberty and adolescence. Discomfort with a changing body. Disgust at a menstrual cycle. Frustration with social expectations of females. ""Safe"" exploration of guys by creating fanfic or gay shipping (not AT ALL uncommon among heterosexual girls, as Rainbow Rowell's ""Fangirl"" aptly points out). The feeling of being ""different from everybody else."" Maia's conviction of never wanting children. In fact, the only ""weird"" things that jump out to me are her extreme fear of vaginal penetration and ""autoandrophilia,"" the idea that she's turned on at the idea of herself as a man, or even more pervasively as being androgynous enough that someone can't ascertain her biological sex. That, coupled with her eurotophobia, makes me wonder if Maia experienced a traumatic event in childhood. Maia comes across as casually misogynistic. One thing in the book that was entirely glossed over was a night when Maia's lesbian aunt pointed out that the trans trend is deeply misogynistic (only quoting FTM trans movement in the book, nothing about the more recent MTF encroachment in sports and prisons). Apparently they had a discussion about it that lasted ""until 1AM,"" but Maia was not so kind as to share the highlights or the takeaways, which is really a shame. Maia also seems to think that a desire to have children is not only uniquely feminine, but something that all women experience, except for her, therefore she's somehow ""not a woman."" We don't live in a time or place where women are destined to be brood mares, so this attitude is a bit weird. I empathize with Maia's frustration at her mother pining for grandchildren and wish that parents of adult children in general would knock it off. Late in the book, Maia decides to adopt a set of alternate pronouns. Who would I recommend this book for? Anyone interested in reading about a person who is still trapped in the ""personal fable"" phase of adolescence. Trauma/child rape survivors who are in a strong place emotionally. I'm not sure that a normal teen going through normal teenage angst at the upheavals of puberty would benefit from this book. I think for a 13 or 14 year old girl, new to a period, skeeved out about tampons and annoyed with bras, a book like this could be unnecessarily confusing. Teens think things are wrong with them all the time, and this book might heap confusion atop of confusion. Teen angst and a bit of dysmorphia/dysphoria are common as people shed their childhood bodies for their adult ones, but Maia takes it to a near-pathological extreme. One thing I really do appreciate about this book is that Maia NEVER mentions self-harm or suicide. There seems to be a trope that failure to immediately acquiesce to someone's pronouns or gender identity means they'll promptly kill themselves, but Maia never even hints at this. Actually, the book is a couple of years old, but Maia hinted at ambivalence about a double mastectomy.Bottom line? It's an OK memoir, definitely not appropriate for the junior high set, possibly appropriate for mature high schoolers, and the ""gross factor"" of certain images is somewhat overstated.Show more"

I got it from the library and was going to save it for June. I was just curious and started reading a few pages. After about four pages, I didn't put the book down until I was finished. I am cis-gendered and straight, so for me, a lot of this was just learning to understand about someone else's experiences. I'm also asexual, though, and know how long it took me to discover that this was an actual thing and not just that I was some sort of aberration, so I can understand both why this was a difficult book for Kokabe to write and illustrate, but also why it felt important for em to share eir experiences, so that others in eir situation (or similar ones) could see that they are not alone out there. The internet tells me that in 2023, this book has been banned from shelves in more American states than any other book, because of its subject matter, and illustrations. The book deals with Kokabe's journey exploring eir gender and sexuality, and because the memoir is graphic, there are also pictures. I didn't think anything was particularly graphic or shocking, and some of the topics explored, like body dysphoria and discomfort with periods or gynecological exams, I suspect would be just as applicable to a lot of cis-gendered people as trans-gendered or non-binary individuals. The deeply puritanical and backward thinking of people who ban or challenge books never fails to surprise and depress me. I'm assuming that the justification for wanting this removed from shelves is that it might turn kids gay, or non-binary or something? I'm in my early forties and it wasn't until my mid-thirties that I even knew that asexuality was something that existed. I know how uncomfortable I felt until I realised that this was an actual orientation, and not just me being weird. Questioning one's gender identity and not feeling comfortable in one's body must be a million times worse. Books like this, which can show teens and adults that there are others out there that feel the same are hugely important and can change and even save lives. So this book should not be banned. It should probably be taught in schools, at least for older teens and college students. Only a day or two after finishing the library copy I had borrowed, I went out and bought a copy for myself, so I can lend it to friends. That's how important I think this book is. I applaud Kokabe's bravery, and reading about eir intense discomfort of being referred to as a 'young lady' or having people use the wrong pronouns has made me try to be better about using more neutral pronouns with the students I teach because you never know which of them might not be comfortable being lumped in with other cis-gendered, binary classmates. I am sorry to say that I still need to work on remembering not to misgender my non-binary and/or trans-gendered friends on occasion, but I am trying to be more sensitive to these issues. Judging a book by its cover: I really like both covers of this book, the one on the original edition and the one on the hardback special edition. Both covers feature two versions of Kokabe, one a more youthful and innocent depiction, the other an older, more reflective one. E is a very good artist, and subsequently, the cover illustrations are evocative and tell a story in their own right. Show more"

While one person‚Äôs story certainly doesn‚Äôt encapsulate any identity as a whole, it‚Äôs always informative to see how dysphoria and searching for the right labels that resonate with us can be challenging and non-linear.I‚Äôd recommend this if you‚Äôre looking to dip your toes in a shorter queer memoir, but admittedly I‚Äôm a reader who likes more depth and layers in memoirs so this didn‚Äôt fully resonate with me! All personal preference though. Thanks to Libro.fm for the free copy of this audiobook. :)Show more"

It is so honest and you get to tag along on kobabes journey to finding out eir identity and sexuality. E is a reulctant autobiographer and wasn‚Äôt comfortable with sharing personal matters. Struggling with explaining the issues to friends and family and society, e finally decided to write and draw it out. You get to be part of big and small moments as e discovers who e is. And it is in the seemingly small things you get to see the struggles one faces as a gender queer. E grows up in a very liberal environment, both parents and peers seem so open to lgbtq+ matters. I wonder what a young person in rural south would feel or in a religious family where it couldn‚Äôt even be discussed.This week, some kids in Norway were held back from school because there was a class where the pronoun Hen was mentioned. Hun (she), Han (He), the gender neutral/nonbinary Hen can be widely used when you don‚Äôt know the gender of the person or what he or she or e prefers. Much like Maias prefered e. The mother told the news that it was because it is a fact that we are either born male or female and that hen is bullshit. Four Pages in Kobabes book is dedicated to the science behind how we grow genitals in the woomb and also how the brain develops after the genitals. So if something happens in this development of the brain, you can be born with a brain and genitals that don‚Äôt match completely. And then we haven‚Äôt even spoken about nurture after birth. This book is really important. A book like this should be compulsory reading in school. Imagine How many allies people struggling could possibly have. And to find out you are not alone.. and to find out not at age 25 or 40, but when you are forming your identity as a young adult. That would be valuable. And it would save lives. Artistically, this is solid work. I enjoyed reading and I identified with some of the experiences.Show more"

However, in being different it was also very privileged. A friend of mine (shoutout to Izzie) describes it so well in their review: ""The author has queer family members (therefore also accepting / willing to learn about gender and sexuality AND also having English as a language understood throughout the family) & tapped into a lot of queer spaces ever since they were young -- I couldn't relate to a lot of these privileges so this book wasn't really for me, but I'm sure others will feel seen and represented (and cis folks can potentially learn more about GNC/NB (gender non-conforming / non-binary) experiences.""Sidenote: There was also one bit of the memoir that rubbed me the wrong way, where Maia studied the science that backs up the existence of gender queer / gender non conforming / trans identities. Science in this day and age is very much rooted in colonialist systems, which means ""science"" as we know it falls into the same oppressive traps that make it hard for non conforming identities to exist in the first place. In other words, Maia uses the research of a white woman to justify the existence of TGNC identities when white people who were the ones who wiped out these identities in the first place in their colonialist and imperialist pursuits. POC and indigenous folks have never needed science to acknowledge and respect TGNC identities. So here, the use of science is a colonialist paradox and also erasure of BIPOC.I understand that this helped Maia come into their gender queer identity but I just wanted to point out the problematic prevalence of using science to justify any non-conforming identity (which applies to more things than just gender/sexuality).Show more"

Honestly, I spent about an hour on it. I‚Äôm going to need to revisit/rewrite this review when I‚Äôm not so sad about losing all of those thoughts. This book gave me the gift of a whole new vista, a glimpse into someone else‚Äôs deepest thoughts and most personal experiences. Did it make me uncomfortable? Sometimes, yes. But it was worth it. I‚Äôll write more later.Okay, here‚Äôs my follow-up. There are certain sexually explicit parts of this graphic novel that would make almost anyone feel uncomfortable and shocked. I don‚Äôt know the answer to whether or not this book should be kept off of high school shelves. Well, I know the answer for me, but I can see the complications. It is definitely an adult graphic novel‚Äîintended for adult readers. But my gut tells me this is an important book for kids who are questioning and exploring their own gender identities, who may never have found themselves and their unique challenges on the pages of a book. My gut also tells me that this is an important book for kids who haven‚Äôt ever thought about their own gender identity, who‚Äôve never felt any kind of gender dysphoria. And, finally, my gut tells me that some readers (and parents) may just not understand any of it. So what do we do with it? We talk about gender identity with our kids and students. Knowledge is power. Fear of someone who is different than us causes misunderstanding, judgment and distrust. Some very offensive content? Yes. Pornography? Absolutely not. Students should have the right to make informed decisions about what they read.Show more"

Eir story is so close to mine I'm honestly still recovering between this and I Wish You All the Best. Maia recounts eir journey with gender identity and sexual orientation. Eir interactions between eir friends and family are too similar to mine and how e still struggled with correcting people, especially strangers, about eir pronouns and identity feels all too familiar, and so were the questions eir family presented em. If I had read this in high school, it might not have taken so long for me to figure things out and I might not have gone through with certain events in my life because I thought I had to because that's what girls my age did. Like Maia, I didn't realize I had options other than boy, girl, trans boy/girl, until much later in my life and I forced myself into situations that weren't exactly comfortable but were kind of expected of my cis counterparts. But enough of me.This book is a very important story and I commend Maia for sharing eir truth and eir story with the world and I thank em for eir bravery.

I was really looking forward to this because I'm non-binary and queer and I totally loved it. If you're looking to learn more about gender identity, this is a good book with good insights. It's easy to read and it's accessible and fair bit of it really resonated with me. There were things that made me smile because I've thought them too and there were things that made me wipe away a tear because I'd felt them myself. It's always very cool to see aspects of myself in a book because that doesn't happen very often. There was so much in this book that I related to, which was such a satisfying experience. For instance, ""high fantasy gay wizard prince"" is totally my wardrobe aesthetic, too, and it's nigh impossible to find good clothes. High five in solidarity, Maia! There was just as much that I didn't relate to, but everyone's different and reading the author's story was a wonderful journey. I think when I read books about non-binary people I want to see myself there, and when I don't completely, it's a bit of a bummer, but that's just me getting too caught up. There are so few books with non-binary MCs that it's a big deal every time and hopefully someday that will change. How lucky for kids growing up today to have books about non-binary people at all. I got this from the library and I'm going to buy myself a print copy. I am looking forward to re-reading it. I was thinking four stars because it didn't grab me quite the way I'd hoped (damn those expectations!), but it's special and important and I love that it exists, so I rounded up.Show more"

Straightforward and accessible memoir of the experience of growing up with an internal gender identity that is neither male nor female as those identities are traditionally defined, perceived and lived. Many of the author‚Äôs experiences in, firstly, self realization of eir identity and, secondly, coming out to others about eir identity mirror my own experience coming out as trans/FTM in the ‚Äò90s. Funny how my chosen gender identity term for so long was FTM and how that sounds like an archaic term now. I haven‚Äôt changed but the language of identity has. Interesting digression but...back to Kobabe‚Äôs book, I learned a lot and could empathize with a lot of the experiences. Simply living openly can be complicated and having to decide in the moment whether to insert one‚Äôs identity into a conversation is challenging. On the one hand, you want to be true to yourself and transparent to others. But when others are misperceiving your gender - misgendering you - correcting their perception takes the focus away from the intended topic and diverts attention on to yourself. That's particularly problematic in work situations. 20+ years after I came out, it‚Äôs easier to come out to people now and gloss those gender conversations because I am not explaining my identity from scratch. There‚Äôs general awareness of transgender experience. I hope Maia Kobabe is able to look back in 20 years and find the same thing-that explaining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of pronouns and gender identity is no longer revolutionary.Show more"

I never really understood what it meant to be 'gender queer' but this memoir explores this, and tells the story of a person who finds that e is gender queer and what it means for em. It is a journey which starts when e is young and then develops as e becomes a teenager and then an adult. As an adult e is able to embrace a non-binary life. E is both asexual and non-binary but has had to discover this. This book is educational but it is more than that because it is a story of self-identity and self-understanding. Our world is intolerant of difference and it is used to divide and exclude people instead of embracing and valuing one another. This story really encouraged me to embrace who I am (even though I am not non-binary) and not to allow any one to eclipse who I am and what I have to offer.The author has shown how e has managed to do this by writing this graphic novel. It is beautifully told and the artwork is lovely. The drawings are quite simple but convey a powerful memoir and I am so glad I read it.

It‚Äôs an incredibly informative look into a drastically different perspective and life from my own, making this story so incredibly valuable for those who do and do not relate to the journey depicted. To speak on the actual storytelling and pacing, however, is where I think this memoir tends to fall flat (and often). The transitions between topics are clunky and, at times, jarring. We go in and out of memories across a non-linear timeline with no perceived rhyme or reason behind why memories are lined up in the specific order they have been placed in. The book also feels like it ends very suddenly- I did a double take when I turned the page and saw that the book was over.

Many of the comments about this book remind me of responses to Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic by Alison Bechdel, which I have read twice and greatly enjoyed, so I decided to pick up this newer graphic biography and find out what all the fuss is about. Kobabe is a professional comic book artist, and this fact is evident from the beautiful, expressive, and dynamic art style used in Gender Queer. I appreciated Kobabe‚Äôs candid and vulnerable portrayal of growing up and coming of age, and I especially enjoyed the sections about Kobabe‚Äôs time working in a library. There are some issues with the book, the author‚Äôs flippant approach to pederasty in Plato‚Äôs Symposium being the most glaring. I also think the book is too short.

This was GOOD!This autobiographical graphic novel by Maia Kobabe hits many expected points--gender dysphoria, theater kid, social awkwardness, first period, navigating relationships, eventual coming out, etc.--but with a depth and clarity that's rare in my experience. I've read a number of LGBTQA+ autobiographical comics and GNs over the decades, but this one stands out from the pack. So many moments linger: the magic of discovering David Bowie's music for the first time, the wry humor of assuring people that yes, an MFA in Comic Arts is a real thing, the clueless response to the flirtation at the library, er decision to liven up er wardrobe, the mental second-guessing of trying to get pronouns right ‚Ä¶In particular, e does an incredible job of describing the feelings of pain, violation, and wrongness following eir first pap smear. ‚ÄúWhat my body told me was that this intrusion of the outside world into my internal physical being was wrong on a level too deep for words.‚Äú I don't even possess the anatomy that a pap smear would require, but I *felt* that.

In fact every book had the same basic structure and tidy transition narrative. It seemed like there was only one official transgender story that was allowed to be told, and if you didn't check those boxes you didn't get to exist.  In Gender Queer, Maia Kobabe breaks the mold completely. This memoir really captures that searching, that ambiguity, that uncertain exploration with the finer distinctions of identity and sexuality. Am I gay? Or maybe bi? Or maybe asexual? Trans? It's a journey and the answers aren't always so black and white.  I didn't expect it to be, but this book is like 95% the story of my life, just coming from a different side of the coin. There is some very very specific stuff in here about sexuality/puberty/identity, I was going through a version of this shit from like ages 10-14 that haunted me, since I had no frame of reference for any of it and barely even knew what being gay was. I have basically always assumed there was something deeply deeply wrong with me. And no one who I ever spoke to about it as a kid really seemed to be able to help (they usually just made it so much worse lol). Having this book at the age of 14/15 would have been life changing. But also I got bullied enough when I was a kid. HahaShow more"

So I definitely find myself struggling to reflect on a book that I respect the heck out of and enjoyed reading from as a whole in the aftermath. I definitely found myself smiling and laughing because Maia has a lot of geekish loves that I share with em (books, anime/manga, etc.) that are explored in ""Gender Queer"" alongside some moments of humor in awkwardness and reflection that I appreciated as well. But I also realize how important of a graphic novel memoir this is because it's a very creative, brutally honest, and intimate portrait of an individual coming of age story from a non-binary creator. (To which I say, I would love to read more graphic novels from Maia and individual stories from other non-binary creators and will do my best to seek them out to share widely and reflect upon.) ""Gender Queer"" essentially navigates Maia's life growing up as AFAB (Assigned Female at Birth) and talking about eir family, friends, and people encountered with a lot of heart and love. This is also a notably mature portrait of many things Maia experienced that are related to sexuality and sexual exploration, body image and perception, attraction (or lack thereof and some awkwardness that ensues from that), personal relationships, identification and personal pronoun use, among other things that were unique to Maia's experiences growing up - ultimately becoming more comfortable with as e grew to an adult. Many times, I felt like I could understand where Maia was coming from with all eir experiences, paired with the paneled illustrations (complete with expressive illustrated reactions in tow). I felt for Maia a lot as e navigates eir life through several ups and downs. There are fun parts and difficult parts to this memoir and it had me along for the ride the entire time. What I will say is that the audience for this depends on how comfortable you are with talking about body issues, sexuality in general, and ultimately open discussions about that because this does not hold back. There are artistic representations of nudity and sexuality that are in this book, as well as talking about things like getting pap smears for the first time (which Maia makes clear that was a traumatizing experience for em), periods, masturbation among other topics. And that can prompt larger discussions, especially for those who identify specifically as non-binary or may be on the GLBTQIA+ spectrum, of how that experience can be. These are sensitive issues, and YMMV in terms of being ready to approach it, but I found it valuable because I found myself asking questions in hindsight that reveal that there are different places and spaces and terms that those of us that are in positions of privilege for identity don't recognize. And it normalizes facets of identity that differ across a wide spectrum, with terms to define and illuminate the shape of them, if even from an individual perspective.  Overall I'm glad that I had the opportunity to pick this up. I chose it to read for my September Banned Books reading challenge because at one point this book was banned in my system (note: not school, it was taken from the whole system so that even adults couldn't read it) library before being restored after a number of challenges. Rather than having to wait in queue for it, I bought the beautiful deluxe edition, which include sketches and other illustrated scenes that were nice to see. I thought the artwork in this was so well done, and I liked the color schemes/palette that was used throughout the book. Overall score: 4/5 stars.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41305720-jarrett-neal,Gender Queer,Rating 5 out of 5,"April 19, 2024",6 likes,0,"I picked up Gender Queer with the intention of reading it slowly over the last few days of Pride month. To my surprise, I finished it in two hours and was ready to start reading it all over again. No review I could write will do this book justice, and no superlative can match the degree of esteem I have for Maia Kobabe and this memoir that is now part of the queer canon. Readers of all genders and orientations should read this book multiple times and take its lessons to heart. No writer can predict the impact, if any, their work will have on the world. In writing and illustrating Gender Queer, Maia Kobabe has given the world the most illuminating text on the subject of nonbinary gender identification there is to date. The best memoirs trascend solipsism and reach out to others in rare and complex ways. Gender Queer achieves this through it frank and poignant narrative of an individual accepting eir nonbinary gender and rebuking prescribed gender norms. Like Fun Home and Persepolis, its closest peers, Gender Queer is a graphic novel that broadens the scope of the form. While I consider the illustrations in those books slightly better and the treatment of their respective subject weightier, Gender Queer is no less profound. Kobabe expertly crafts a visual memoir that both affirms and provokes, and it's all to the good.Much of Kobabe's journey toward embracing eir nonbinary/asexual identity has to do with eir upbrining. Kobabe's parents are truly rare in the sense that they are more open and honest with their children than even the most liberal parents. They bend gender norms and stereotypes themselves, so it comes as no surprise that their child, unlike most children, is given the freedom to explore gender and sexuality in a nonjudgmental environment. Kobabe spends a surprising amount of time thinking about eir identity and body. Kobabe's open discussion of the trauma associated with being assigned female at birth, the horror of eir genitals, and the conflict surrouding eir sexual desires is to be applauded. So many people in our society take these issues for granted or talk about them in degrading, sophomoric ways. When people get real about the body, its functions, and its inability to confirm to societal standards they get scared. But Kobabe doesn't flinch, and I admire eir so much for that.I also admire the fact that Kobabe surrounds eirself with people who both champion eir nonbinary status and question it. The biological determiners of gender, which Kobabe applies through engaging with Dr. Patricia Churchland, also merit discussion. Similarly, Kobabe's mother and aunt both challenge the idea of nonbinary identity, and for me em aunt's assertion that ""this trend of FTM[,] trans and genderqueer young people . . . [as] a kind of misogyny"" is, I think, a fair question (195). While Kobabe doesn't provide a sufficient response to this, when e and the book are trying to do is exhort readers to take people at their word, let them determine their own minds, most important, give them full mastery over their bodies. I can't understand why anyone would contest this idea but, sadly, many do. Conservatives desperately want the public to believe that Gender Queer is nothing more than pornographic musings of a mentally ill person. Do not buy into the fearmongering and warped sensibilities of those whose lives are too myopic and bigoted to conceive of anything else. The reason Gender Queer triggers disgust and outrage in certain quarters is that gender is presumed by many to be the most fixed identity trait there is, informing nearly every aspect of daily life. Kobabe shows us that all that we know or think we know about gender is largely constructed, a truism most enlightened people already know. The truth hurts, and Kobabe knows it. Bravo to em.Show more"

At that time, I was questioning my gender (or there lack of possibly), so I wanted to read anything that had to do with gender identity.However, I was scared of being questioned as to why I was reading it even though many in the book community online was. Fear, I tell you.Years passed, I came out as non-binary, and many bookstore trips passed. Yet I never purchased this memoir 'cause it no longer felt needed, but I kept it at the back of my mind.Then one day, I got really lucky going through Netgalley and noticed the deluxe edition was up for request and now here we are.The art style is so beyond stunning. From the font and where it is placed to the actual art style to the color pallet... it is just perfectly beautiful. There were moments I just stared at a page to take it every single detail.Now, the way the story was told did confuse me sometimes. There were moments we would go back and forth in certain parts, which would throw me off but would only last for a few seconds.All in all, I really enjoyed my time reading and taking in this memoir. There were so many moments that made me smile and made me emotional. For some reason, though, the scene with the underwear made me happy cry. Not exactly sure why, it could be how perfect the happiness was drawn that made me full of joy, but all I know is that I cried.As many of us know, this graphic novel memoir is listed in 'books to ban' lists since it came out and has been mentioned a lot more this year. This is a very important story that can be so helpful to so many people, young and old alike, so we need to do what we can to have this graphic memoir be at easy access for everyone.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147324966-christian-stoic,Gender Queer,Rating 1 out of 5,"November 12, 2022",5 likes,0,"I heard about this book because of the controversy, and checked it out from the library to find out for myself if the parents were right to remove this book from school shelves. I also wanted to find out why a woman would ""abandon"" her womanhood and declare herself ""non-binary"". Here's my thoughts on the book as a ""gender atheist"":It started out interesting, but there was too much navel gazing and a lack of critical thinking skills by the author, and Maia's story seemed to be a case of ""not like other girls"" syndrome. Maia shares multiple moments in her life where she had a bad experience being a girl and being jealous of boys, like wanting to be shirtless outside, but doesn't think about the negatives of being a boy or the positives of being a girl. For example, men are more likely to die of melanoma (skin cancer) than women, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association. (Maybe that has to do with men exposing more of their body to the sun?) Men also have higher suicide rates, can get drafted, are not taken as seriously if they are abused by a female partner, more likely to be seen as suspicious/dangerous than women, etc, but those things are never brought up. The grass is always greener on the other side, I suppose.It also seems that the older women in Maia's life never taught her to appreciate being a woman or to be feminine- her mom wasn't very traditionally feminine (she didn't shave her legs or teach Maia to), her aunt seems to be a butch lesbian, and she didn't have any older sisters growing up. Because of this, Maia had a hard time connecting with other girls, which is why she kept mentioning how she doesn't ""feel like a girl"", but what does that mean exactly? What does it mean to ""feel like a girl""? Do all girls around the world feel exactly the same way? There are feminine traits that Maia exhibits throughout the book, and feminine hobbies that she enjoys, but doesn't acknowledge as feminine. Liking the boy band One Direction, for example, and writing fan fiction about them, seems to be something that girls enjoy doing more than boys. And the list of manga/manwhwa authors that she read (Page 145) are mostly female comic artists who wrote mostly shojo or romance manga, which is popular among girls. And reading yaoi/shounen ai (boy's love) manga is also geared towards girls, not boys. There's even a Japanese word for women who read yaoi manga: fujoshi.I agree with Maia's aunt on page 196: ""But I have a hard time seeing this trend of FTM trans and genderqueer young people as something other than a kind of misogyny. A deeply internalized hatred of women."" Maia denies this and they have a long conversation, but we never get to read the conversation because it's completely skpped over. It definitely seems like the author has internalized misogyny when she would prefer to have male genitals over female genitals, would prefer a gender neutral name over a feminine name, wished to get top surgery (to remove her breasts, which she did get eventually), and thinks the word ""girlfriend"" or being ""girly"" as a negative thing.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review"

I would actually recommend that my fellow olds pick this up and educate themselves.While I appreciate what the book taught me and love the fact that nonbinary people can see themselves reflected in it, it ultimately didn't hit for me. I appreciated it very much on an intellectual level, but it didn't move me on an emotional level, which is surprising because I am quick to tears and usually especially moved by stories of young people being vulnerable. I think perhaps this is because we get to know a lot about Maia's gender identity but not too much else about em. I get that it's a tricky tightrope to walk and that this is fundamentally a story about gender identity, but also Maia the character clearly wants to be seen as more than just a gender identity, but Maia the author doesn't give us enough info to make it possible for readers to do that.

This is the same county that brags about its equity initiatives and inclusion efforts. I guarantee that none of these white cis board members even read this book, but they were more than happy to post one out of context image on their social media pages to stir up homophonic and anti-sex rage among our community. It‚Äôs so hypocritical, because there are many books in our libraries that represent cisgender sexual awakening and heteronormative experience, but a book that explores non-binary topics must be censored. Shameful. This is an important book, and I hope that my students realize that it is at least still accessible at the county library even if it is out of school libraries .

Maia Kobabe grows up in a small, open-minded community, where kids play outdoors and go to Waldorf schools. But e never feels comfortable with hitting puberty, or the gender expectations places on eir. It's a brilliant and informative read about coming to understand yourself, and the ways in which being trans impact on your whole life.

Challenge Prompt: Read a graphic novel by a POC or LGBTQ+ author. I checked out this book at my home library system, which has made a notable effort to prioritize queer and trans programming and selections. This is a particular privilege in our region, because the county over from us (where I used to live) has been actively working to ban Gender Queer and similar books from public school libraries. I knew this was an incredible disservice before reading it, and feel this even more after completing the book. After just a few pages, there is no way not to see what this book means to people. The copy from my library is literally coming apart at the seams and even missing some pages, which shows the love people have for it, and how relatable it is to so many of us. Maia Kobabe (e/em/eir) is an incredibly talented graphic artist, and also a compelling memoirist in eir own right. Eir way of visualizing and giving words to these unique experiences was so helpful even for me as an adult, so I love to think of younger people getting an accessible headstart on understanding their identities as a result of this book. I was also delighted to learn that asexuality was a recurring theme in this story. While being vaguely familiar with the book beforehand, I was not aware that the author was ace, and that e would delve into how this impacted em in ways that compounded the overwhelming nature of trying to get people to understand your divergence.My one gripe is that I found Gender Queer to be a bit choppy in certain places (in this way, it felt kinda similar to my experience with Hijab Butch Blues. This could simply be me getting used to the graphic novel format, which at least in this case, does not have chapters or other major section dividers. Finally, I liked that Maia didn‚Äôt have this huge change in eir character development over the course of this story, where e suddenly became a different person who wasn‚Äôt anxious and could speak up every time someone misgendered em. The lack of ‚Äúarc‚Äù in some ways is the best mirroring of the nonlinear high school coming out journey e depicted on page 94. It also creates a weird meta-effect where the book itself feels like a piece of eir continued journey. It seemed like writing this book was a huge step of bravery and witness for the author, and I am glad to have been along for the ride! Overall, would recommend to anyone who has about an hour to spend with it! Well worth your time, even if just to feel a bit more connected to your non-binary or ace loved ones.Show more"

Maia‚Äôs story will be a comfort to so many coming of age who don‚Äôt feel totally feel like their body is aligned with who they are. Eir story was so raw and honestly very eye opening for me as well. I had never thought so deeply about how much worse those moments in puberty would be for someone who isn‚Äôt cisgender. For the most part Maia‚Äôs family and friends were supportive and tried to gain understanding of how e felt, and I have no doubt that this memoir will serve as a life vest for teens and adults who don‚Äôt have similar support systems. If you can, I highly recommend you read this both with the graphic novel and on audio. Both formats have benefits and I think my experience was the best doing both. The graphics of the novel are perfect. They‚Äôre beautiful done and evoke so much emotion. The audio (which is only 2hrs long!) is done by a full cast, with sound effects and music. And the audios narration also has some additional lines and details added in to make eir story flow seamlessly. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn more about being queer and/or nonbinary. Whether that‚Äôs because you want to be a better ally, you want to understand others in the community or because you may be looking for answers about your own gender identity. Note this is one of the most banned books in the USA. Access to this book could literally save lives of queer youth. (Please let me know if I used any pronouns incorrectly!

That's a lifelong instinct I have, to oppose idiot censors and to support those they would block. I was also glad I read it since some of my students identify as nonbinary, and hopefully this helps me support them a bit better.It's a solid memoir of growing up into a nonbinary gender identity. Kobabe describes feeling adrift in their (actually ""eir,"" as Kobabe prefers Spivak pronouns) body from childhood on, increasingly unhappy to be gendered female. Gender Queer takes us through eir exploration of different identities, until settling in early adulthood on being nonbinary.There's a lot going on in this story, sometimes on the margins. Science fiction and fantasy fandom is center stage (interestingly, Maia adores Harry Potter, but never turns against JK Potter). There's a sexuality current which spends some key years in asexuality, coupled with a fanfic focus on gay male sex.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1095613-meepelous,Gender Queer,Rating 5 out of 5,"August 21, 2019",3 likes,0,"And today we are taking a look at the nonfiction memoir comic Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe. Originally published in 2019 by Lion Forge. There is very light nudity, about half real and about half suggested (with people contorted to cover everything controversial). This is a coming of age story so stuff like menstruation and other puberty developments do loom large at times. I would describe the author/artist person, but that seems to be the point of the book itself. The official description is as follows: In 2014, Maia Kobabe, who uses e/em/eir pronouns, thought that a comic of reading statistics would be the last autobiographical comic e would ever write. At the time, it was the only thing e felt comfortable with strangers knowing about em. Now, Gender Queer is here. Maia's intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma of pap smears. Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity--what it means and how to think about it--for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere.I guess the only part that I'm not really sure about is that last part, because as an afab person who isn't sure how I identify otherwise, I felt like some questions about what nonbinary is were raised but never actually answered. Not all questions for sure, but I think this is mostly related to my own continuing frustrations and not related to the book itself. Being about the same age as myself, there was a lot of myself and my friends that I saw in this narrative (both gender wise and other wise) which was fun.The artwork was another real high point of this book as well. The farthest thing from aloof and/or melancholic, Gender Queer is colorful (although strictly realistically), full of all sorts of emotional energy, the page layouts are the skilled balance of varied and easy to follow. Even with a little bit of visual metaphor to express some of Kobabe's harder to explain feelings, I would recommend this as a very easy first comic to many people who are still holding out on books with pictures.Gender and sexuality obviously take centre stage in this life story, less so class and race although Kobabe came across to me as fairly aware of eir place in the world as afab, white and not poor, which is much preferable to total naivete and ignorance.Show more"

Memoirs so often strike all the wrong notes of confessionals and sure enough this one was very much of the sort. Very personal, too personal?

For me it read like an overshare, I‚Äôm a private person and I don‚Äôt really understand the millennial/generation z‚Äôs passion to splash their lives all over memoirs, social media, their skins, etc. But be it a generational or a cultural thing, everyone seems to be doing it and to be fair what would an average 30 year old write about in a memoir, how many accomplishments can one have accumulated by then. In this author‚Äôs case the main accomplishment seems to be figuring out how gender and sexual orientation business, finding the labels and pronouns that work and writing a book about it. Of which, I can objectively appreciate the latter. It was a nice book, good art and such. The rest‚Ä¶that seems to have taken some time. No judgement, just an observation. It‚Äôs difficult to review a memoir, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre inadvertently reviewing a person‚Äôs life, but there‚Äôs also no way to separate the two, after all here is someone who has put their entire life (dear diary style) in very minute and personal details on display for all the world to read about. So maybe it‚Äôs difficult not to think judgy thoughts like‚Ä¶how are two parents, both educators, are ok with their child being unable to read until such a late age. Anyway, Kobabe seems to have made up for the late start, becoming both a reader and a writer, so there‚Äôs that. But no idea if and how E writes outside of er own experience. E‚Äôs definitely a talented cartoonist. Those are the correct pronouns. E/em/eirs‚Ä¶beats they, them, theirs. Difficult to remember. But that‚Äôs what works for the author. So anyway, for the confused and struggling, this‚Äôll be very relatable, other than that‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs about as interesting as an average autobiography of a 30 year old, which is to say it‚Äôs a self obsessed navelgazing journey of discretion abandoned and self centered revelations.

This is required reading for anyone who considers themself an LGBTQIAP+ ally. Gender Queer is the top banned book in America, so that should also motivate anyone to pick this up. One of the reasons for removing the book off shelves is ""pornographic"" material, including depictions of puberty, menstruation, rear nudity, masturbation, and sex. I am not a parent, but I personally feel the content is not conveyed sexually, but educationally and clinically.TW/CW: on-page blood, on-page vomit, gender dysphoria, misgendering, homophobia/transphobia, mentions of Harry PotterKobabe's experience at the OBGYN and a first period is going to be extremely relatable for so many teenagers (tbh was fairly close to my own experiences).

Maia uses the Spivak pronouns e/em/eir, so I use them in the review. I hope I am using them correctly. I got this from Netgalley and this is an honest review.GenderQueer: A Memoir is gently vulnerable and revealing. Kobabe was born into a family that didn‚Äôt enforce gender roles and seems to be supportive of their children becoming who they are. Maia was assigned female at birth (AFAB), but as e grew up, e ran into more and more questions and discomfort around the gender e had been assigned. E wanted to be neither female nor male but lacked the words to describe or understand emself.Maia Kobabe takes us through memories and the evolution of understanding emself to be genderqueer. Kobabe moves from childhood, through the confusion of jr high and high school to the discoveries of a wider world in college and graduate school where e began to meet nonbinary people. Despite a loving family, Kobabe‚Äôs confusion and body dysmorphia made em retreat inward, refusing to reveal eir inner life. This graphic novel, written and drawn by Kobabe, is the secret e kept for so long. It is personal and intimate. It is an invitation to Maia Kobabe‚Äôs life and a gift of understanding. It was originally meant to be an explanation for eir family and it is a beautiful teaching tool.
Between the oceans and the mountains is a wild forest. That is where I want to make my home.
As the writer and the artist, the words and drawings are seamless in telling eir story. There are 4 pages that struck me in particular ‚Äì How happy e was dressed as Johnny Weir, the violation e felt at a gym exam, the page where e explains eir visualization of gender, and then eir determination to throw off bland boys clothes and adopt the ‚Äúhigh-fantasy-gay-wizard-prince of my dreams look.‚ÄùI loved reading this book.

I didn't go into Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe knowing how much I would have in common with em but, my word. My enormous amount of similarities aside (which include reading the Alanna series by Tamora Pierce, having painful pap smear experiences, working at the library, not craving romantic relationships and other more personal ones) this book is just a well written, researched, and presented memoir all around. Yes, I have this bias that I related to the protagonist, a young writer, constantly discovering more facets of eir sexuality throughout the book, more than ANY person whose memoir I've read...but in addition to that I learned SO much from this book. So many feelings, desires and interests I'd never explored, so much terminology and, from Maia's personal narrative, a great deal of compare and contrast understanding about my own gender identity. I applaud Maia for taking eir class with Mari Naomi (another of my absolute favorite memoirists) and having the skill and GUTS to take these stories from childhood to present and give them to the world with such clarity, such vivacity and artistic integrity. If I could sit all day and read coming of age, gender identity (and artistic identity) themed memoirs, I would, so there is also a bias there...but I think this one by Maia Kobabe is especially good and is a must read for people of all ages and understandings on this subject. We need more literature written BY and FOR every possible gender identity and sexual identity and Maia's all out explanation AND portrayal of BOTH of eirs is admirable and, what's more, historical and RELEVANT.

Anyway, there were so many things mentioned in the comics that made me feel less alone like preferring to keep my hair short and getting annoyed with waxing/shaving.

Call me a liberal, woke, progressive if you will, but I kind of think that this book should be suggested reading, if not mandatory reading, to students in Jr/Sr high schools. I myself do not identify as gender queer, I am a straight woman, but there were still situations and thoughts that Kobabe had at a young age that I would have easily identified with, and knowing that other young people went through the same thing would have been real nice. I cannot imagine going through my young adult life being as confused and unknowing as Kobabe was. While ey did not want to write such a personal memoir, I am soooo glad that ey did! (see what I did with the pronoun usage? I learned so much in this GN!) I hate that this book is being banned, it's a gem. It's a guide. It's a friend. It's an object that young people, or even old people like myself! can refer to, read, relate to, and learn from. It's a memoir that was not available to my generation, but I'm glad it's there now. I hope libraries continue to fight for this books freedom. I hope groups that see this as something filthy and pornographic learn that it is so much more than semi-graphic depictions of thoughts and feelings, but it's actually real life, that people think and feel the things that Kobabe wrote and illustrated in it!

I hoped to get a clearer understanding of the coming of age experience for asexual non-binary people from a POV with a bit more hindsight, but Kobabe‚Äôs story seems instead to still be a confusing ongoing learning experience. So my main takeaway is just that it can understandably be very confusing to figure yourself out when your specific identity has zero media representation (which this book could help with), but I assumed that before I read this.Also, at least as presented here, Kobabe‚Äôs experience seems more guided by solo interaction with stereotypical signifiers of LGBTQ internet culture than I expected, and I found that focus on defining oneself by Harry Potter houses and Myers-Briggs acronyms and which ‚Äúslashfic ‚Äòships‚Äù you‚Äôre a fan of to be less interesting.In contrast, a single page is used to drop quick unspecific mentions to a long-term friendship dissolving painfully, a serious family medical issue, and developing a first crush in many years, without offering anything further about any of them. I‚Äôd love to read several more pages on any or all of those, far more than more pages covering quirky Harry Potter house-type material that feels mostly frivolous to me. Kobabe is honest in the early pages here about having to overcome initial resistance about sharing anything too personal, so offering even a single page mention of those three stories may have been difficult, but to me it‚Äôs still a frustrating decision in a memoir.Show more"

I want to take nothing from Maia and her emotional/ personal struggles. But, I found this book terribly universal. Maia talks about their sister often, and everyone with a sibling can connect with this story.

Also the author makes it clear that ""girly"" things such as lace and sparkles are desirable only when worn by a man (Johnny Weir).This book felt like a list or timeline, there aren't a whole like of slice of life stories to show rather than tell. We get pretty much no family stories just a page listing and labeling the mother, dad, and sister.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/623075-ed,Gender Queer,Rating 4 out of 5,"July 22, 2022",3 likes,0,"Decided to pick this one up awhile back when it was at the center of a high school library ""banning"" in the El Paso, TX metro area (I'm just across the border in NM) but since have seen that this is at/near the top of the list in getting banned across the country as LGBTQ (and most especially T) rights are under assault. Obviously, I know the concept of sexual orientation and identity beyond cis hetero is a bit too much for far too many folks (who I'm guessing would even quiver at the terms ""cis"" and ""hetero""), but I was still curious to see what all the fuss was about... but more on that later.This was certainly a interesting and enlightening book. While I know the title of this graphic memoir was ""Gender Queer,"" I was still expecting it be a story of being trans ... but as is the case in many things in life, that's way too simple. Maia's story is one of being on this spectrum of gender identity that is not so easy classifiable. I think even folks who read this who are open-minded and ally-oriented may still be confused and challenged by Maia's story ... and I include myself in this, as a (cis) gay male... but that's the beauty of what e is doing here. Structurally the memoir is a bit messy ... abrupt jumps and scene changes (with a very ""what?!?!"" ending ... which suggests a sequel (??), but I am not aware of), but again it encapsulates the struggle of figuring out who you are and the trying to live an authentic life when it neatly does not fit into one of society's often restrictive boxes. And Maia also nicely captures that once you figure things out for yourself, the struggles of communicating that to the world and sticking up for yourself against daily microaggressions (or worse). This was particularly evident near the end when Maia discussed er pronouns (e/er/eir - ones that I certainly wasn't aware of before reading this) and the balance of trying to be yourself and stick up for yourself but end up being silent and ""polite"" as not to make people feel comfortable -- which again, is something I could relate to as a gay man.So back to the ""banning"" issue -- no surprise, I don't think any book should be banned or not available to whoever wants to read it. That said, I can see why there is a controversy about this at least in school libraries. While I know a LOT of it is about the queerness of the story, there are explicit images (nudity, dildo, etc.) -- granted not many, but still enough to give me pause. That said, I was recently on a jury re: a case of alleged sexual abuse of a minor -- and it was shocking to hear from fellow jurors who were either parents of young children and/or work in elementary schools about how young kids are exposed to sex and violence and in a graphic nature. So maybe my now seemingly Pollyanna childhood is not a comparison basis of what kids can handle -- not that I'm equating porn to this piece of work, tho I know its detractors certainly think otherwise... and not that this book would be in an elementary school library anyhow, but again just given some of the explicitness of the images and language (again, minimal) it did give me some pause.That said, of course it still should be available in a public library as I think it would super valuable and so important for anyone who finds themselves on this sexual orientation and/or gender journey, particularly one that is not so easily classifiable.Show more"
https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier-pati-o,Gender Queer,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 15, 2023",4 likes,0,"I was reading an article recently in the New York Times that listed a handful of the most contentious books. These were constantly brought up in board of education meetings throughout America, with parents calling for their bans. Gender Queer earned the number one spot for the book that conservatives wanted to burn at the proverbial stake. So naturally I went to my local library and proudly borrowed it.I enjoyed the book because of how much clarity it offered to the nuances of human sexuality. For time immemorial, humans placed gender in two neat little boxes, male and female. But what if it‚Äôs more complex than that? What if, biologically, sexuality is more complicated? One only has to look at nature and see that it isn‚Äôt so cut and dry. Societal norms, especially ones put in place by religion, has a huge impact on how we view gender roles. And in my opinion, these have been responsible for the repression of groups like the LGBTQ community.Through the artwork drawn by Kobabe, e (the author identifies using Spivak pronouns -- e, em, and eir) tells the story of em multi-faceted sexual journey, from the confusing times of adolescence to adulthood. Maia grew up in a liberal family in rural California and was mainly homeschooled until about the age of ten. E says that em parents never assigned gender roles at home, so once e started public schooling, e became painfully aware of the rules that society sets upon gender, especially for females (in one memory, e remembers taking off em shirt at a beach trip for school after seeing em dad take his off, and she was quickly reprimanded by the teacher for doing so. E was confused as to why it was such a big deal.)Kobabe also mentions a book written by Patricia S. Churchland titled Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain. E quotes a passage in which Churchland explains how sexuality in the fetus develops. Once the enzyme responsible for developing either the male or female sexual organs does its job, testosterone or estradiol enters the bloodstream and floods the developing brain. Sometimes, explains Churchland, the baby can develop testes and a penis, but more estradiol enters the brain, or has ovaries and a vagina and receives testosterone. This can explain why sometimes people are born biologically male or female but identify as the opposite sex. I found this very interesting and will probably read the book for further understanding.I believe everyone should read this book before passing judgement. I watched an interview with Kobabe and e explained that e wishes e would‚Äôve had a book like this to help em through her journey of self. E hopes other kids feeling this way will have the option to read eir book and receive guidance for what must be so confusing and frustrating. But how can they have access to this work if conservatives continually call for its banishment?Show more"

I have thought a ton lately about how I‚Äôd want my own children to be schooled, especially with respect to the current political atmosphere and its positive or negative effects on the public school system. So this book seemed like a highly necessary read to further inform my opinion. My three star rating is not reflective of my view on the actual content of this book. Much like when I just threw a rating at the Dobbs decision, providing a genuine rating of this book or a discussion of its ideas would just make someone mad on one side or the other. I will, however, say that this book really bummed me out in terms of what modern high schoolers consider ‚Äúreading‚Äù. It‚Äôs a comic book with shock value every few pages. Though it was 250ish pages in length, I read it in under an hour bc it had so few words. Truly, it felt far more like scrolling (through Instagram or tik tok) than reading. The mental flow was one of brief entertaining glances here and there rather than intense consideration of thoroughly developed ideas. Maybe that‚Äôs what comics are all about, idk. No doubt this book was entertaining and maybe even fun to read! BUT the popularity of this book in certain high school circles scares me that the attention economy has even reached its tentacles into the realm of ‚Äúliterature‚Äù. If high schoolers want LGBTQ+ content, fine. Read Oscar Wilde. Does my love for the written word damn me to have an unfair disdain for comics? I hope not.

Gotta know what all the fuss is about to get this so heavily banned from schools and libraries....Those book banners need to grow up. And maybe actually read the book instead of cherry-picking select drawings to flash around out of context. This was great. It's a really personal, in-depth look at the author's journey through figuring out eir sexuality and then eir gender, and one that I think a lot of queer folks will identify with (or even cis/hetero people who've struggled to figure out their place in the world). It's also educational for people who don't know much about being non-binary, or think that AFAB transpeople are just girls jumping on some kind of misogynistic tomboy bandwagon. I have a close friend who's also non-binary, and I'm itching for them to read this book because I think they'd really relate to Maia and the journey that e went through to get to this stage, as well as the frustrations with getting others to understand and respect their non-binariness.Aside from the genderqueer component, this was a nice memoir in regards to bookish nerdiness. I almost cried in the early pages when Maia wrote about struggling to read, and then the Harry Potter craze hit. E couldn't wait to find out that happened at the pace that eir mom read the book, so e picked up up and inhaled it on eir own, and has been an avid reader ever since. Even knowing what a troll JKR has turned out to be, I still hold a special place in my heart for the Harry Potter books, the amount of enthusiastic readers they created, and the way they made so many of us feel connected to something. She can't take that away from us. Later, Maia also relates to Alanna in Tamora Pierce's books, and mentions Lord of the Rings enthusiasm as well. Joy, a reader after my own heart!I also liked this as a graphic novel. The artistic style reminded me a lot of Lucy Knisley because it's simple, colorful, and expressive.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-ali,Gender Queer,Rating 5 out of 5,"February 14, 2023",3 likes,0,"I picked this up as a good librarian because it became the most 'banned' book in the USA last year. For fellow Australians, the US system is a bit weird in that it allows for elected bodies to ban books from being in school libraries. In the last two years, political organisations have been nominating for these bodies and working down a list of books to have banned, with Kobabe's coming-of-age graphic non-fiction top of the list. As of September 2022, it had been banned in 138 school districts across 32 states. The listed motivations usually include sexually explicit images - which is a bit silly reading the book, which certainly contains frank discussion of teen-important topics like masturbation, negotiating sexual encounters and desire, but contains nothing resembling erotic images. The most confronting panels (and I *think* the only nudity) depict pap smears, which Kobabe experienced as traumatic.This kinda brings us to why this book would be such an asset in a school library. In a world where most kids will explore sex via online porn, Kobabe's book provides a refreshingly realistic, candid set of conversations about sex and gender. Far from 'recruiting' to a particular identity, Kobabe's focus is on explaining, through personal experience, how to identify and act on emotions. Some of the strongest parts of the book demonstrate how to set boundaries and navigate consent, as well as how to unpack strong feelings and how to give yourself time to analyse and, for that matter, to change. The pap smear sequences contrasted sharply with the kind of sex ed we were given, which, from the best of intentions, brooked little discussion of negative experiences. Genderqueer embodies (heh) a new and better, approach to giving young people skills to understand and manage their bodies and emotions, and that is all to the good.Also, it's technically pretty damn good for this kind of comic.Show more"

I think Maia Kobabe‚Äôs depiction of eir grapplings and transformations were especially well highlighted in a graphic novel format. Eir memoir centers identity and bodily examination, and e utilizes the benefits of drawing what eir bodily examinations looked like. Maia Kobabe is an artist and beneficiary of queer understanding, then, and eir impact is a narrative that is so intensely transparent it reassures some, familiarizes others, and makes some really, really angry.I believe I fall into the category of individuals who gained greater familiarity with a specific queer voice from Kobabe‚Äôs memoir. Eir story creates a space for empathy regarding gendered language, as empathy largely hinges on understanding, and there isn‚Äôt much literature as accessible as a graphic novel. For me, seeing the inner turmoil and eventual decisive nature of Maia‚Äôs switch to pronouns that created confidence within em, I felt ignorant of an entire system of amplifying language.Now, because of this story, I understand that dismantling the gender binary cannot be achieved by simply offering a ‚Äúthird party‚Äù of sorts, and that a reliance on the pronoun set they/them/theirs for all people who are non-binary or gender non-conforming is not necessarily productive. Freedom of expression is at the heart of general conversations about and within the queer community, so why should there only be a single additional way of referring to people beyond the defined binary? 3 is greater than 2, but 3 is still incredibly finite. Gender Queer is inspiration for everything I have written about the singular subject of pronouns, as well as introducing me to a wide array of moments that center gender and forced me to think about gender. I think I could easily write a double digit number of essays to better understand Maia‚Äôs experiences without even adding my own observations of my experiences. Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe has reinstated my feeling that exploring individual experiences inspires empathy, and for that I admire em immensely.Show more"

This memoir will be a comfort to those who don‚Äôt feel that the body they have aligns with who they are. Maia‚Äôs family and friends for the most part were supportive of em and it appeared that they did their best to understand how em felt. One of the most memorable moments for me in this graphic novel occurs on page 71. You have to spin your device/the page to read the words on that page and it like I was spiraling as I was twisting my device. It felt like a direct representation of how Maia may have been feeling at that moment. At the moment that e was trying to figure out how e identified. Another memorable moment for me was seeing the graphic of how Maia felt after the first time e had a pap smear. I remember having a visceral reaction to it. I immediately had the thought of how difficult it must have been for Maia after that actual appointment if just the visual representation of how e felt caused me feel that way.

And the struggle to find clothes that fit our own person, not what society expects of us? Oh gosh, why won't we talk about these kinds of things more often? Why must so many of us suffer alone? Also, the reliance on fandom for comfort and survival--oh yes. The bits that were quite different from my own life, I read so that I could learn and understand. There are a few pages that show naked bodies and sex scenes. Actually, I found it amusing that my library copy naturally opened up to the page most often cited by book-banners--people have been peeking!

I believe in the freedom to read and would agree that this book is not for everyone, however, there was nothing truly objectionable about it. At its heart, it's the story of someone who has never felt comfortable in their birth gender. The author is not lesbian nor heterosexual; rather, I believe, asexual. Kobabe explores this fully and unflinchingly in a brave effort to understand and be understood. I have a close friend who, while she identifies as female, has never worn makeup, shaved, or dressed with feminine style. She also has never felt the desire for a romantic or sexual relationship. I have never thought one way or another about her choices, she is just my friend. But when I talk to others about her, they express incredulity and think she's weird, and this hurts me deeply. And, as a Catholic (and specifically addressing the issue of gender confusion), I have only deep empathy. I do not judge as it is not my place.

Kobabe's journey and processing is, I imagine, very similar to those that don't identify with their sex assigned at birth and are more fluid in both gender and sexuality. I admire anyone who shares their journey in this level of detail - very brave indeed!I can see why this book was contested so much. There were parts where I was a little shocked at the level of detail shared. Would I want my 12 year old daughter to read this? Not yet - I don't think she is prepared for some of the concepts and images yet (granted, I have no idea what she is looking at on YouTube so maybe she is more educated than I am on sexuality!). But my 14 year old son? Maybe. High school level for sure. When Kobabe shared eir own struggles with pronouns, so powerful!! I'm in higher education and pronouns are a big thing. We are being educated on their use and it is hard for adapt. Watching Kobabe encounter this issue as a person in the process of learning new pronouns and a person using new pronouns was very affirming. And I think that's the whole thing. This book is written to share and affirm those individuals who don't tick the boxes on a form. And that's a beautiful thing. I LOVED when e embraced the clothing and style that e was really into. I love watching middle/high schoolers try different styles until they land on what represents them, free of judgement from others. It's such a win for that individual.If you've wondered ""what the deal with pronouns/non-binary/fluid individuals?"" I highly recommend this book. I'm not a non-binary/fluid individual so I'm recommending from a lens of cis-gendered, straightville so maybe take my rec with a grain of salt. But ND Stevenson recommended it and you can't go wrong there!Show more"

Then to me which feels so true is this feeling of learning a new word that describes you, that describes something that you couldn't describe before... and it brings you this realistic ending, this second-guessing of coming out and what it meansReally an honest memoir of a queer experience that I definitely recommend with a very very high four stars!!!Show more"

A trav√©s de experiencias personales, Kobabe nos habla del dif√≠cil proceso de entenderse y llegar a la idea de identificarse como una personaje no binaria. Gracias a un sinf√≠n de referencias de la cultura popular y al ensayo y error en el apartado emocional, consigue ponernos en su piel. Nos regala algo tan hermoso como las herramientas para entender a alguien que es diferente a la idea heteropatriarcal de g√©nero e identidad.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75596120-emily-rink,Gender Queer,Rating 1 out of 5,"September 23, 2023",3 likes,0,"I am in no way advocating for or encouraging the banning of this book; however, I think there is a certain audience for this book that must be taken seriously when putting this into a collection and reading it. First and foremost, the sexual content. It is not that young adults don‚Äôt have access to these materials online, like pornography, but there is a fine line between explicit content to teach and explicit content to be erotic. For example, page 167 depicts oral sex between Maia and another consenting adult, adult meaning in their final years of graduate school so about 26, using a strap on dildo to simulate oral intercourse. The sexual education in this instance is not to teach, but to show the erotic and pleasurable affects sex has. Even as an adult, those images in graphic form may be triggering to those who aren‚Äôt prepared to see that type of imagery. If not for seeing these images online previously to me reading this book, I would have been very stunned and taken aback since there was no indication that the direction of the book would have been taken this way. For young adults, having that content presented to them in this form with characters that are much older than them doesn‚Äôt appear to be the most appropriate option. Other images in the book are very rough and abrasive on the eyes, like images of bloodied feminine products as well as depictions of pap smear instruments. Without even digging into other issues like depictions of minors masturbating, the images in this book really aren‚Äôt to be taken lightly.The age audience, being young adults, is really only relevant to about a quarter of the overall book. Take in mind the topic listed above, pap smears are typically only conducted for those who are 21 - not in high school or middle school. Grad school and college sexual experiences are experienced by those over the age of 18 - not in high school or middle school. And maybe the author‚Äôs intentions were NOT to have high school and middle school students read this, but unfortunately that is what this book has been marketed to. For those struggling with those issues in high school, there are plenty of other books that approach this topic with a lot more discretion and age-appropriateness. Maia really missed the mark in terms of content audience.I really am sympathetic to people who experience this form of mental illness as gender dysphoria as a diagnosis is something that can affect the outcome of many relationships and experiences. For example, Maia‚Äôs experiences at the gynecologist is resembling many people's first time - yet, I can understand that having extreme discomfort with that area might make this experience even more detrimental to one‚Äôs psyche. I can understand that wrestling with one‚Äôs identity is a stressful experience. And I understand that having a support system is difficult when you don‚Äôt have the courage to stand up for yourself. However, this book emphasizes the root of all conflicts comes from people who don‚Äôt know rather than those who don‚Äôt care to understand. There is a difference between someone not using preferred pronouns because they don‚Äôt know them and not using pronouns to just be an asshole. If you would have asked me a year ago what ‚Äúe, em, eirs,‚Äù pronouns were, I would have looked at you with a befuddled look on my face. Me not knowing doesn‚Äôt mean I am upholding some Agenda - it‚Äôs just that I didn‚Äôt know. I think Maia wanted to use portions of this book to villainize those who didn‚Äôt use preferred pronouns when Maia should have spoken up and asked for those to be used. I can‚Äôt read minds. A final note on content is that I find it interesting that Maia makes this distinction between ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about being male, it‚Äôs more about not being female.‚Äù Coupling that with the thoughts that equate Maia‚Äôs thoughts on the matter as misogynistic, I can see where there are some issues here. So far, all of the content in this book refers to womanhood as something that Maia cannot stand and even reviles at the thought of having woman processes like menstruation or breasts. If it is not about hating women, then why did I get the feeling that my existence of being a woman was something to feel disgusted about?Besides the content, I feel like this book was very poorly written. The actual writing in the book was very choppy and not very ‚Äòmemoir‚Äô like. For someone who is using this book as a metacognitive exercise, the story was just very bland. Also, the lack of chapters and separation between ages made this super hard to follow at times. For certain parts of the book, Maia aged ten years in two pages and then we were back to talking about childhood. Where is the continuity?The only reason why I am giving this book two stars is because the topic of this book is relevant and the issues discussed are sensitive to the times. Some people who want to ban this book simply want to because of the content and discussion of pronouns and sex in graphic form. It is not so much about the form and content of the book than it is the advertised age range and inappropriate images for minors. Adults are more suited for this audience. As a final note: the fact that this book not only mentioned but glorified a Dean/Sam sexual romance and fanfiction from the hit show Supernatural only makes things worse‚Ä¶.I hope the author knows that these two characters are brothers‚Ä¶.right?Show more"

I am of a generation to which these issues are foreign, not because of traditionalist notions of gender, but the contrary. To me, who has never considered myself neither gendered nor particularly straight, and rather fluid and free in these things, often fall into thinking of modern gender sensibilities as expressions of essentialist notions of gender. (Fully recognizing the privilege expressed in this position, and the privilege of feel ungendered by the fact that I am cis-male). This book expertly does away with these ideas, and cut to the human nature of the issue. In the end that is what counts, how we meet each other as humans, with love and respect for each others narratives and identities.And as I continue to make mistakes down my path, I hope people will see me and my mistakes for what they are, and not expressions of ill-will or intolerance.

Per questo motivo, ed anche considerato che non sia io il target a cui questo libro √® rivolto, non lo valuter√≤ con le stelline: lo considero pi√π una testimonianza, vedo il suo valore in quanto rappresentazione. Anche perch√©, come libro in s√© e per s√©, ha parecchi problemi. La narrazione, forse per troppa voglia di Kobabe di comunicare il pi√π possibile, √® caotica ed impersonale. Le vignette sono asettiche, pi√π affini ad un manuale che ad un memoir, quasi artificiose nella loro struttura, che sembra un insieme di scene aggregate come se fossero dei pezzi non consequenziali: con una storia cos√¨ intensa √® un peccato che ad alcuni passaggi sembra che manchi l'anima (forse la traduzione non aiuta, sia per i tempi verbali scelti, un po' formali, sia per i limiti di genere nella lingua italiana).Rimane, comunque, il grande pregio di trattare in maniera incredibilmente diretta e senza filtri argomenti che di solito vengono considerati dei tab√π.  Edit:  leggendo ora qualche altra recensione qua su GR, ho scoperto che, negli Stati Uniti, questo testo √® stato criticato per i contenuti troppo sensibili e ""censurato"", e sono allibita. Innanzitutto, una comunicazione esplicita non coincide necessariamente con la volgarit√†, e questo ne √® un esempio virtuoso. In secondo luogo, la stragrande maggioranza di prodotti audiovisivi, anche acclamati dalla critica, che ho visto negli ultimi anni e che provengono proprio da oltreoceano contengono scene parecchio pi√π scabrose o sessualmente esplicite, senza nemmeno avere la giustificazione dell'inclusivit√† (anzi, spesso sono frutto di male gaze).Show more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2538454-halli,Gender Queer,Rating 1 out of 5,"February 19, 2023",3 likes,0,"I came to read this book from a WSJ article where a school district is/was attempting to ban books, this one included. (Other books that were named specifically in the article were ""All Boys Aren't Blue,"" ""The Music of What Happens,"" and ""The Magic Misfits""). Like one of the mothers in the article I wanted to read the material that people claimed did not have a place in the school library.Here's my take:I read this because I am trying to understand the conversation. I read this because I want to understand a person's experiences in life but also understand (or not) why a particular book is being ""banned."" Kobabe lays out eir struggles clearly and intimately. Eir intimate experiences are unique to them and I hope eir's hurt someday finds a salve. Throughout the entire book there is this massive undercurrent of pain. I truly hope e/E (which Spivak form are we using here?) finds the peace that e is looking for.This book has been published for teens. The things with which I have an issue are small in the context of the book but are as follows: the naming of separate works that could have content inappropriate for younger ages (am personally not likely to read Lackey's work), naming of a fetish pornography site which catered to the BDSM crowd, graphic depiction of sexual acts (one between a physically mature male and a physically immature male and another between the author and a sexual partner). The last one, whatever go to town, this is your learning party not mine. However, if this book is being marketed to the under 18 crowd why would the author depict ""sexual aides"" when the under 18 crowd isn't encouraged to purchase these items yet? I'm not talking about the egg part. Shall we include the depictions of the incestual relationships of fanfiction that the author describes as stimulating? These are small points with which the author could have omitted from eir story and eir story would have been JUST AS IMPACTFUL if e had chosen the better part of valor. I've seen other reviews that are also irritated with how the author's parents are depicted. My favorites are from Amber Lea, Olivia, and Chama in order:""...I'm mad at the author's parents. Who doesn't teach their kid basic social rules before sending them to school? You can let your kid be however and still give them a heads up about how other people operate. It's like moving to Japan and not bothering to tell your kid anything about Japanese culture and sending them to school to find out everything the hard way. Why would you do that?""""It seems the author‚Äôs parents left them woefully unprepared and uneducated about life, and that doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. Especially knowing the father was a teacher, yet his own child didn‚Äôt know how to read until 11, or what a period was until getting one, or to use deodorant until being confronted about it in high school. Kobabe describes a constant feeling of being ignorant of things that other kids already knew, and that‚Äôs the parents‚Äô fault. There was no guidance in kobabe‚Äôs life. I think that‚Äôs a big part of why they seemed so emotionally and socially stunted.""""I felt angry about the author's parents while reading this as well! Eir parents were painted in a good light, but they neglected to teach their child important things about eir own body? Seems like a bit of neglect.""Kobabe, if you're proudly for everyone, you're proudly for me too.

I saw myself in these pages and reading this made me feel so seen. This is graphic novel is about finding out about oneself, this was informative and challenging. Kobabe talks about being gender queer specifically being non-binary , being asexual, changing pronouns, coming out to their family, and they talk about so much more. It felt so relatable when the author talked about not feeling male or female, the author's love for reading was also relatable. I was a big reader even when I was a child, I used those stories to escape. I remember reading some of the books they talked about liking and I even took some recommendations in the books that I hadn't heard of before. One thing I did not love were the Harry Potter references, considering HP's author's stance on trans people. I understand that Harry Potter was a big part of Kobabe's life, it was a big part of my life too. As a non-binary person I gave my love for Harry Potter up due to the author's hateful stance on trans people. I wish Kobabe would consider not including HP references in their books.The author talks about writing fanfic of the members from One Direction and I don't know how I feel about people writing fanfics about real people, I don't think I like that. I will not be leaving this a numbered rating because I do not rate memoirs or people's life experiences, though I will say that I did love this memoir.I rented this from my local library via the Hoopla AppShow more"

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15121327-majo-de-la-guardia,Gender Queer,Rating 2 out of 5,"May 9, 2022",3 likes,0,"I have two thoughts on this book.Upon reading it was the most banned book in the US right now, I was very curious and wanted to know what was it that had parents and politicians in such a fuss. The NYT article that led me to the book mentioned there was graphic period blood and sex, which is what disturbed most of these people. Thinking there is nothing wrong with children learning about periods and sex, I was even more curious now. Bought the Kindle and began reading during my lunch break.First, the visual style is cool, nothing too bad or too good. It gets the job done, I guess. The depictions of periods and sex are indeed there, but I'd venture they are about 5 pages of the book tops. Quite graphic, yes, but nothing that would scar someone in my opinion.Now onto the two points that factor into the two star rating. Number one is where is the narrative arch? This feels like a stream of consciousness with no ups and downs, just a character narrating eir experience, albeit, a very valid experience, and part of what drew me in as a cis woman trying to understand trans, non binary-ness, gender fluidity and other concepts I can't fully wrap my head around. This was a person narrating how eir experiences shaped eir world view, but for me lacked critical thinking‚Äìwhich I was expecting. The second point, which another reviewer here notes, is the lack of that conversation with the aunt by the end of the book. I was disappointed to not have that conversation in the book. It would have made it much richer. Because without it, the book reads to me like this person with gender dysphoria who is not able to truly take a deep dive into who e is‚Äìwhich in turn would have improved the narrative arch mentioned in point one. I truly don't want to be mean, but I would like to know if Maia had any positive experiences that e could associate with being female? As the other reviewer mentions, this feels like a book more about NOT being female, more than being androgynous, gender queer or something else. It gave me the impression of a child traumatized by her period‚Äìwhich I think we can all be when we first get it‚Äìaccompanied with social anxiety and being an introvert to the point of enduring seemingly unsurmountable physical and emotional pain. All in all, in my experience, I don't see/value gender in the same way as the author. I don't quite understand why it's such a big issue, which is the question I was trying to dive into with the book and that still has no answer for me. I can value how this is a great book for someone that has a similar experience to Maia's. They can feel seen, understood and validated. That is awesome! However, not a good book does that fact make.Show more"

Born a female, they now identify as non-binary and asexual and wish to use the e/em/eir pronouns. Maia struggled with their identity from an early age, and through various experiences decided what identity worked best for them. I believe Maia‚Äôs memoir could help someone struggling to realize that they are not alone, and it often is a zigzag path to discovering one‚Äôs true self.So what exactly is so controversial that it is number one on the Top 10 Most Challenged List, considering it was nominated as a Stonewall Honor Book? One reason is the description and illustrations of sexual acts. Another is that some people judge gender identity harshly. What some people don‚Äôt understand, they will reject and demand others also reject it. But as author Judy Blume once said, ‚ÄúCensors don‚Äôt want children exposed to ideas different from their own. If every individual with an agenda had his/her way. the shelves in the school library would be close to empty‚Äú.Now I don‚Äôt want to pretend that this book didn‚Äôt raise any issues with me- I think the adult themes make it a better fit for the adult collection than the teen collection, but it is on the teen 2023 Illinois Lincoln List, and as a teen librarian, I have a shelf for these award-winning books. Thus it will remain there and then go back into the teen/adult graphic novel collection next January when I showcase the 2024 list (they are always a year ahead). I‚Äôm proud to work at a library that does not censor. In fact, our rural library has all ten books found on the 2021 list. As I handle the social media for our library, I have shared graphics, links and pictures on our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts about Banned Books Week. Ultimately, people need to decide for themselves if they want to read this book, and I believe fully in everyone‚Äôs freedom to read! ‚ù§This review can also be found on my blog: https://graphicnovelty2.com/2022/09/2...Show more"

I generally dislike to rate memoirs poorly, especially of fellow queer people, but I took issue with some of the aspects of the book (and no, not in a ""ban this book!"" conservative way). I will start with what I enjoyed:- A discussion of gender that includes genderqueer identities; that ""not wanting to be female"" does not automatically mean ""wanting to be male""- The honesty of disclosing feelings such as penis envy, which could help other queer people understand themselves - The art style and representations. I very much enjoyed the sun/moon/seed analogy on page 65, and ""gender as a landscape"" on page 191Here are the items I took issue with: - I found it odd, given er gender identity, that e would still identify as a Ravenclaw. Please stop supporting Harry Potter. Every time you support JKR she turns around and donates your money to anti-trans funds in the UK. Please, we need to show celebrities transphobia will not be tolerated.- E was writing fan fiction of One Direction in grad school. I am not fond of publishing fan fiction of real people in the first place, as it causes rifts in real people's lives, and I am doubly not a fan of fan fiction of real teenagers. - Also, why did e include an incest pairing when talking about fan fiction. That's a weird thing to promote. - There is no such thing as a male or female brain. Please go read ""Delusions of Gender"" by Cordelia Fine. - As someone whose first pap smear was also traumatic, this does nothing to ease my anxiety. Also, if I was 14 and reading this, I would probably be even more scared. E should've done something to ease teen's minds if that was the target audience. - The book abruptly changes topics and goes back to these topics later. Sometimes I would pull back the page and double check the pages were in sequential order because they didn't feel that way. This book could be helpful to some, and for that I am grateful. But it also promotes questionable to harmful ideas promoted to the youth who will read this, which is very unfortunate.

Hard to review this since it was like reading a map of my own inner thoughts half the time. Maia puts into words and art what I don't know if I would ever have been able to myself. What a brave and inspiring and hopeful work this is, thank you Maia. I could have definitely used this a little earlier in my life too, it would have helped me to realize that I wasn't 'broken' or 'late' when I had no interest in getting into relationships, and didn't seem to be connected to my gender in the same way as others seemed to be. The way e paced, wrote and illustrated this graphic memoir leading through eir experiences and feelings often made me feel like I could finally breathe, that I wasn't alone, it almost made me cry at times.Even now I often feel so alienated from other folks, even those who are also in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum, because I still see people not believing me, or treating me like they can somehow 'fix' me. It's difficult to review, because even in the off chance that someone I know would read this, I feel like I'd open myself up to more scrutiny and disbelief. ""You can't be non-binary because you don't bind, or have long hair, or wear jewelry."" Or simply, ""...but you're you, you can't be someone that I can't imagine. You can't be someone that exists outside of the image I created of you.""I also really appreciated eir hesitation around adopting pronouns. I also don't feel like a 'they,' and when everyone at my place of work added their pronouns to their email signatures I held off for a long time, because even though I don't think of myself as a she, or he, I also don't feel like a 'they,' but that felt like the only other option. E, eir, em, definitely feel more like me. But, I don't feel brave enough to come out at work.

After reading Gender Queer (in one sitting), I am more enlightened about the complexities of gender identification. The beauty in this work comes from Kobabe‚Äôs wonderful family, and the artist‚Äôs undeniable honesty and courage. The comics platform is effective because so much of Maia‚Äôs path involves physical appearance. Because some of the images and descriptions in Gender Queer are quite sexually explicit, this book may be too much for sensitive readers. Gender Queer is currently one of the most challenged and banned texts in America, so I‚Äôm compelled to add some thoughts about its appropriateness for school-age readers. Although this kind of decision-making is highly contextual, Gender Queer is one of the edgiest books I‚Äôve read lately. With that in mind, would I put this book in a middle school library or classroom library? No. Would I assign this book as required reading for high school? No. Would I place this book in a high school library or classroom library? Yes. Would I feature it in a college library? Yes.Several factors influence my thinking on this. Most of the book takes place during Maia‚Äôs college years and young adulthood, although there are episodes that take place in junior high and high school. To be honest, I think most adolescent readers would lose interest in the second half of this book. In addition, Maia‚Äôs college-age interest in ‚Äúgay porn‚Äù and ‚Äúlesbian porn‚Äù (Maia‚Äôs words) is problematic subject matter, as are some of the later depictions and discussions of sex toys and specific intimate interactions. While older, more mature students may find Maia‚Äôs odyssey and insights useful and maybe even important, some adolescents are just not ready for this level of intensity. I think there is a way to make a ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩyoung reader‚Äôs version‚Äù of Gender Queer, and that could be a welcome and more widely palatable addition to school book shelves.Show more"

Both for cisgendered, heterosexual individuals like myself and for those who might be questioning who they are and how they feel about others. For the former group, it's crucial to understand what others are going through so that when a person, for example, requests that e be referred to with e/eir/em pronouns, the requestee understands how personal, important, and totally reasonable that request is. For the latter group, books like Gender Queer make it wonderfully clear that you are not alone.It helps, of course, that Gender Queer is brilliantly written, a memoir that is compulsively readable while also offering much-needed details about gender dysphoria, asexuality, and a myriad of other orientations and concepts that definitely need explaining in our modern world. I also was delighted in how wonderfully typical Maia Kobabe's life appears to be! There's very little dark drama here - Gender Queer offers an intense personal journey, but Kobabe otherwise has friends, attends school, loves fantasy novels. The weirdest piece is not Kobabe's gender or sexual interests, it's that e didn't learn to read until e was 11. The story is compelling without some horrible life event to catalyze it, which I very much appreciated because it makes the book that much easier for all readers to pick up and peruse and find something to identify with.And I should be clear: I very much recommend that all readers pick up and peruse Gender Queer. My only complaint is that it ends rather suddenly, though that is entirely reasonable since Kobabe still has so much life to live. I hope e produces more autobiographical stories in the years to come.(Oh oh oh, and the art is great, perfect for the story being told. Just read it already!)Show more"

Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to take notes, so my usual form of commentary is not possible. Still, it was one of the best (maybe the best) memoir I have read from a gender diverse person. I learned some things about being a non-binary person. Often I had not a clue to what someone's internal feelings or how, when or if, they transition at all. This comic book allowed me to see it, at least how Maia dealt with it. Funny, I know how my transition works and other transgender woman, but I have no clue to how I identified as a woman. I know the progression, but not what makes me a transgender woman, only that I am a woman regardless of what was marked on my birth certificate. So, it was interesting to see what some of things that gender diverse people go through. Granted, it was just one person, so it would not be valid to generalize from eir story.I really could recommend this comic book for anyone who is interested in the life progression of one non-binary person. Just being interested in transgender and gender diverse topics, I feel, it would be a good one also. I‚Äôm not sure where to place the comic book aspect of the book, but I would say at least do not let that prevent you from reading the book.Show more"

In fact, in writing the last few sentences, I‚Äôve had to stop and reflect on it several times to make sure I‚Äôm getting it right. Which is where Kobabe‚Äôs very personal story has its most impact: as an engaging tale that will hopefully make readers stop and shift perspectives for a moment. It should resonate with almost everyone, whether you have ever struggled with self identity or are just trying to be respectful in a moving landscape. Kobabe describes growing up in an era where non-binary and asexual identity is slowly being accepted if not always understood, and everything from choosing underwear to the trauma of a pap smear is covered in this always frank, frequently funny, charming, heartbreaking, sometimes didactic, and touching memoir. By the end, Kobabe admits that e still doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù to students and parents in eirs classes, but this too is more evidence that a journey through personal identity is not a linear process.

A lot of this story is very relatable - and yet it's a very different story from mine, and that different perspective feels perhaps even more valuable in showing how there is no ""right"" way to be genderqueer or ""non-binary enough"". I learned from this read, and it literally cost me sleep because I couldn't put it down. It's engaging, makes you think, and has a way of visually presenting certain concepts exactly the way they feel in my mind. (The easiest example of that is the spiralling thoughts on page 70, but I also really love the plants imagery, and the landscape on page 191.)Being a memoir, the story doesn't really ""end"" (fortunately!). Being suddenly thrown out of the story and back into reality would generally bother me from a storytelling point of view, but when I think harder about it, it mainly disappointed me because I found the author's storytelling voice so pleasant that I'd have loved to hear em talk even more about the subjects of gender and growing up queer. So that feeling only stresses how good this was, and the book certainly left me with enough material to ponder. I might actually reread it right away. (Oh, and starting that reread reminds me that I really love the movie-like start of the book!

First, let me just say: I love a memoir, and I really love a graphic memoir. I love reading about people‚Äôs stories and experiences, and while I believe all books have the capacity to grow our empathy, I feel that is particularly true with memoirs. Maia‚Äôs story is incredibly informative and educational. Many people don‚Äôt know a lot about genderqueer, gender fluid, or non-binary people, and it can often be confusing to people, but Maia does a wonderful job of sharing eir own personal and difficult journey to finding that language and trying to explain it to others. What really broke my heart is Maia‚Äôs worry about not being able to justify eir existence or adequately explain eir gender to others. I have had five students come out to me this year as trans, non-binary, or genderqueer. They have all experienced different levels of support from their teachers and parents. They are all different levels of out. And they all do not owe a single person an explanation for their existence.

It's a small detail, but I really appreciated Kobabe's inclusion of their grandmother's reaction - as a second-wave feminist, she mentioned that she has a hard time seeing the move toward genderqueerness as a rejection of femininity and another form of misogyny. This is something I have (and do) struggle with as well. While Kobabe doesn't go into the politics surrounding the issue, they do point out that it's not the case for them, specifically. Since it's a memoir, Kobabe certainly doesn't have a responsibility to address that critique, but I did appreciate its inclusion - and it made me realize just how hurtful that view can be to folks who are both genderqueer *and* feminist. The memoir itself is wonderful, especially because Kobabe is so honest in their difficulties with gender identity and the ways in which they continue even after the decision to identify as genderqueer - like trying to get folks to use the right pronouns.

Still, the uncertainty over who e is and what e wants from relationships are very palpable and relatable, which is what matters most for this kind of story.With a minimalistic format, very frank narration, and perfect portrayal of emotions, Kobabe grasps you straight away and, for 240 pages, tells eir tale without flinching or shying away from the imperfections.

Given how controversial this book is, I expected something more contentious. It was not particularly contentious; in fact, it was rather mundane. The author talked about their childhood experiences. The majority of the time, I felt like I was intruding too much into the author's personal life, but that could be because I have never read memoirs before, so I am not sure if that is how you are supposed to feel while reading them.

Kobabe's self-aware recollections range from uncomfortable and painful to awkward and joyful and liberating.

It's joyful in many ways, but/and it documents Kobabe's visceral and ongoing struggle to be emself.While I've only read a few graphic novel memoirs, the visuals--both the realistic and the metaphorical--brought me into Kobabe's darkest and brightest moments in a way that I don't think words alone could have done. The images e conjures to show the pain and violence of a pap smear are genuinely hard to absorb. And the simple colors and joy on eir face when e sports the right combination of floral patterns, rainbows, and androgynous clothes--it's magic.This is a book I would give to friends and family members so that they can empathize with the challenges their young trans and nonbinary friends and family go through--even when surrounded by people who love and support them. At the core, I feel like this story makes a point that needs reinforcement over and over: while many things can make it hard to be gender expansive, the biggest problems are the ideas, policies, and behaviors of cis people.I also want for many queer people to find this book, so that it gives them hope, validates their struggles, and provides them a story through which to see many possible ideas, confusions, and opportunities.I also appreciate Kobabe's dissatisfaction with many mundane strictures we easily accept about gender. I read this book and wrote this review in two sittings, in each wearing a different pair of shorts that fit me well. Each has a label inside reading ""womens.""It is my sincere hope that the fact this is the most banned book in the U.S. continues to bring it the notoriety that actually increases its reach. Writing in the intro to the edition I read, ND Stevenson states it so well:""Seeing yourself in the world, knowing that you're not alone, that you could actually have a future as yourself--it's lifesaving. My parents worked hard to make sure I couldn't find those positive portrayals. But that censorship didn't make me not queer. What it did was make me afraid, lonely, and filled with self-loathing.At the time of writing this, parents in Texas and other states have pushed to have Gender Queer banned from school libraries. It's not enough for them to rigorously restrict what their own children read, as my parents did; they insist that they have the right to make that choice for everyone. I understand--more, I think, than they think I do--why they want this. It's a last, desperate attempt to hammer an infinitely complex world into a small, unthreatening shape; to enforce a fantastical reality where challenging subjects simply don't exist; to hole themselves up in a crumbling fortress as the floods come in and let their own children pay the price."" What Kobabe offers is a map for navigating a corner of that infinitely complex world. Eir image of a ""landscape"" for gender sticks with me: ""Some people are born in the mountains, while others are born by the sea. Some people are happy to live in the place they were born, while other must make a journey to reach the climate in which they can flourish and grow.""Show more"

Butch.Nonbinary..?Gender queer?All these words are, on their own, harmless and not exactly ground-breaking.But when it's your identity on your mind, and when you've struggled with it so long, they can mean so much.Maia Kobabe's life story is told in Gender Queer. From not understanding, at 6 years old, why a young Maia couldn't take er shirt off at the beach like Maia's dad and friends, to junior high and high school friends mocking Maia for not knowing girly 'norms', to young adulthood Maia trying to navigate a life outside of er family's. I've talked about this in reviews since making my 'return' to reading and reviewing in 2021, but I myself have gone through a bit of confusion recently.I identified as a lesbian from age 13 onward- facing homophobia from family members and so-called friends, coworkers, strangers on Instagram (ha, remember when i used that app?).I was confused about my gender/gender identity at points as well; to this day i truly don't know if I identify as a woman or as a something else on the spectrum.But my identity (i hate that word) as a lesbian went out the window on Halloween of 2020 when I kissed my close male friend and roommate at a small party.I realized I'd had feelings for him for months, looping back around to when he told me, though he knew it would never work, that he loved me. And wished we could be together.After a few days of inner turmoil, I decided my label mattered a lot less than my happiness did. So I settled for being tagless for a while, then began coming out as bi as more people in my life found out Bear (the boyfriend) and I were together.My partner and I have navigated that road together, him coming to his own sexuality conclusions the more we talked and related, and it certainly hasn't been easy or fun. But the word cathartic comes to mind, as we've both been more open, freer people since we started this journey. Maia's map of identities- pinned at different points in er life because e was at different spots on the spectrum- brings the word cathartic comes to mind once more.It's so, so comforting to know that I'm not alone in these feelings, even though Maia's story and mine are nowhere near the same. Gender Queer is an amazing graphic novel about so much more than gender and it's a must-read for anyone who feels misunderstood, because by the last page you will feel so very seen.The art soft and pretty. Reminiscent of all the graphic novels I read from the library as a child.

While struggling with identity, Maia discovers the Spivak pronouns, 'e, em, eir' and feels drawn to them right away. The pronouns best describe eir attitude about sexuality, and they work for em.This is a memoir of someone not yet 30. E is very sensitive to that fact...so much more life to live, but in the extra materials at the end, e says a collection of small moments can be very impactful...and this book is. The vulnerability and honesty are astonishing. They will inspire others to follow suit..in matters of gender or any other big issues in their lives.Maia is brutally honest about growing up with questions and no answers, about searching for relationships and belonging, about searching. Searching. Searching, and finding few answers. Few mentors for eir journey. Finally e strikes out and forges eir own path to a kind of peace...with many questions still to wrestle with.Thinking as an old, cis white woman, I had much to learn and this book gave me that opportunity. As an old, cis, white high school librarian and educator, I'm thinking about what I would do in a classroom and library setting. I definitely would want copies in my classroom. I would share the book with the class, making it clear that like many other strong books, this is not for everyone. But if books are mirrors and windows and doors, we MUST have many books available to our students, including ones that may make us uncomfortable, ones we don't understand. I KNOW I had students who needed this book, but it wasn't published. I KNOW I had students who would not appreciate this book, and their parents would choose to be scandalized.Would I teach this to an entire class? Nope. Would I include it in my collection. Absolutely. And I'd be ready for the pearl-clutchers who want to take it away from ALL young people. It has a place in high school classroom libraries and libraries. It is not necessarily written for young adults...much of the story takes place when Maia is an adult, still struggling. Are some adolescents too immature to approach this book? Yup. And some parents, apparently, too. All the screaming (including in the debate for State Superintendent of Public School in my home state of Oklahoma) just increases curiosity and sales...for the wrong reason.

Actually, our local library does a ‚ÄúBanned Book Club‚Äù and this was the book for May. I was unable to attend, but it piqued my interest.As a memoir, it‚Äôs an emotionally compelling story. When someone like me - a straight, white, male - reads a book like this one, I believe the best tact is to be open-minded and just listen. Perhaps if more people like me withheld judgment, questioned our own up-bringing and preconceptions, and spent more time in empathetic listening, the world would be a better place.I can see why this book troubles many. There are a couple sexually explicit images and words. To be fair, the stuff here is tame compared to what kids are able to find on the internet or hear on the playground (well, I guess the playground was my day back in the 90s, nowadays I should say, hear from their friends on social media or int text). I wonder how many children of these concerned parents are hearing, seeing and saying far more explicit things? Personally, a frank discussion about sexuality would have been much better for me, and I imagine many of us back in the 90s. I remember learning things from friends, hiding R-rated movies (we knew which ones had the best sex scenes‚Ä¶or just showed some skin) or sneaking dirty magazines (in my case, the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue). Along with this came feeling guilty all the time for believing all this lust was violating God‚Äôs law and that I was probably condemned to hell forever. And again, I dealt with this as a straight white dude. I can‚Äôt imagine adding all the stress of questioning my gender and sexuality! So even if parts of this book make me feel a bit uncomfortable, I am glad books like this be available and - hopefully- used to facilitate discussion.Whether you approve of the book or not, it ought not be banned. That does beg the question, what age teens could read this book? I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs up to the parent and the teen. Kids mature at different speeds so there is no one sized all fits answer. I would say that this book is probably most helpful for teens dealing with gender questions, as well as the parents of those teens. Of course, like any subject, there is no one book that is the final word on any of these things. Finally, it does seem Maia‚Äôs parents were kind of neglectful. At one point a teacher tells Maia, at age 13, that eir needs to wear deodorant. What!?! How could eir parents not give this instruction? Why didn‚Äôt eir parents get eir help with reading? Maia did not learn till age 11, apparently due to dyslexia, though Maia did not indicate any sort of special help being offered. That seems kind of sad.Show more"

Although I did receive a free review copy, this is an honest review containing my own opinion.Note: I am not an own voices reviewer. Pls make sure to look at some of those if you are interested in this story.Gender Queer is an autobiographical comic by Maia Kobabe. It is the story of how e grew up and figuring out eir gender identity and sexuality (and how they intersect). This edition had an introduction from ND Stevenson, mentioning the terrifying and heartbreaking realities of book banning as well why books like this one are so important. I do think the confrontation with this information influenced my reading and made me more aware of how deeply important stories like this one are. I am very glad books like this one exist and grateful that I got to read it. It is one person's story so of course it cannot show all experiences, nor does it attempt to.I really appreciated how it explained many different ideas and emotions and gave me a bigger understanding of nonbinary identity (as well as a lot of book recommendations)! Some parts were mentioned a little bit quickly or were not explained as much as I would have liked. In particular I would have found it interesting to see more of the conversation about some of the issues that were brought up and the explanation against those arguments, but I also understand that it would have impacted the tone of the story and might have made it more negative, so it is an understandable choice. I did think the story ended very abruptly and I would have liked to have a bit more story or some kind of conclusion or reflection. However, as is also mentioned in the novel, this might be an ongoing process of learning and hard to explain in the concise way that fits a conclusion. Overall this was a very personal story (which makes me feel a bit weird even rating it) with an art style that I personally really liked and some interesting information. I think this book is a good starting point, after which it would be useful to look into other stories about the same topic to understand that gender is a very personal thing and although many people can experience similarities, it is different for everyone.TW: medical trauma, dysphoria, (menstrual) blood, misgendering, transphobia, Harry Potter referencesShow more"

E chronicles eir long and still-in-process coming-to-terms with both eir gender and sexuality. The artwork is charming and lovingly crafted. I especially liked eir full-page illustrations of the meaningful people in eir life: you can see the love on the page. And the emotion of key moments was heightened by great framing choices. (Maybe I‚Äôm just describing the benefits of a graphic format overall, something I‚Äôm not a heavy consumer of - though between this book and Something New: Tales from a Makeshift Bride, I‚Äôd like to change that!)A large part of the memoir is Maia‚Äôs internal monologue, which is a big reason why I found it so affecting. It‚Äôs easy to, for example, hear pronouns like e/em/eir and dismiss them as nonsensical neopronouns, but seeing - in word and illustration - the joy they brought to Maia the first time e heard them expands my heart and opens my mind. The book is filled with instances just like this: Maia‚Äôs discomfort with eir body from puberty, eir exploration of sexuality and the nuances of desire and self-discovery, and so on all gave me a window into an experience I‚Äôve never had and a greater empathy for those living it. Maia even explores the argument, put forth by eir aunt, that the rise in trans- and nonbinary-identifying people who were assigned female at birth are subject to an extreme form of internalized misogyny. I appreciated that e took the time not to demonize eir aunt (and this argument), but instead showed her as a loving, compassionate person whose experiences shaped her worldview in a different way than Maia‚Äôs - and as a person who is willing to learn. The biggest reason I say this memoir is vulnerable is less to do with the gender/sexuality aspect and more the fact that Maia doesn't try to make emself a hero - e shares things that might be objectionable, such as having fantasies about ancient Greek man/boy relationships and writing fanfiction about real famous people. I don't get the impression e is saying these things are good or bad. They gave me an honest view of eir innermost thoughts on sexuality. I'm sure I wouldn't be so bold, and I'm a pretty open person. That is the vulnerability I'm talking most about. It opens such a door of trust with eir readers, and through that door empathy can flow.It‚Äôs so important that we read books like these. Maia‚Äôs courage and vulnerability in sharing eir journey has the potential to open many hearts. Understanding another person‚Äôs point of view - empathy - is the key to solving a lot of our problems, and the best way to learn empathy is to exercise it. This book is a good place to start.Show more"

If you like spending time in someone else's shoes, get this.Maia was perceived as a girl at birth but never felt comfortable with that label, yet tries dating boys and then dating girls and then wonders about maybe being asexual or transexual before finally settling on nonbinary with e/em/eir pronouns, which takes a bit of adjusting for those in her life to get. Maia helped me understand better how the use of a simple pronoun can feel for someone who isn't comfortable with traditional pronouns. As with most other first-person books that have an ultimately positive vibe about gender and sexuality, it's clear that a supportive family and trusted friends can make all the difference in coming out the other side of confusion into a healthy life.

Love, love, love plus patience and understanding ‚Äî that's the recipe.The book includes some graphic-novel-creation geekery that's fun to read for those who love graphic novels.I can see why this book is one of the most ‚Äî if not THE most ‚Äî currently banned books in the U.S. It's got talk of sex and masturbation, the latter of which seems to trigger book banning more than anything else. Yeah, for people who don't talk openly with their intimate partners and close friends about sexual matters, you might feel uncomfortable in parts. But for those who can talk openly with trusted people in their lives, there's nothing graphic here, just typical figuring out what works and doesn't work for you sexually and romantically.All the banning efforts have increased attention to the point that a new deluxe edition is coming out two days after this review is being written. Hopefully, we'll see much more from Maia!And if you liked this, I suggest checking out works by Noelle Stevenson, Molly Ostertag and George M. Johnson.Show more"

Dit zegt iets over het oerconservatieve Amerika, maar dat het in de auteurstekst hier op Goodreads vermeld staat, legt het meteen ook iets bloot over hoe marketing vandaag werkt. Onwillekeurig moet ik aan de uitspraak van George Bush terugdenken: 'If you're not with us, you're against us.'Daarom lijkt een genuanceerde blik hier op zijn plaats. Zeker is het goed om de zoektocht van Maia Kobabe te volgen naar wie e is. Wie denkt dat ik zonet een typfout maakte: aan het eind ontdekt Maia de alternatieve persoonsvoornaamwoorden e/em/eir (zoals in de zin 'Vraag em eens wat e in eir koffie wil.') Ik vind dit persoonlijk, zeker in geschreven taal, een mooie oplossing en ga em ook zo aanspreken in deze bespreking.Op dit niveau is het boek leerrijk. Je zit het hele boek in het hoofd van Maia die worstelt met eir lichaam: e wil geen borsten, geen lang haar, geen menstruatie, wil niet vrouw (of meisje of dame of zij) genoemd worden. E is ook huiverig voor elke penetratie, maar heeft wel fantasie√´n over het hebben van een penis. De intimiteit van eir gedachten zo op papier zetten toont de moed om dit boek te tekenen en schrijven en de tegenkanting achteraf maakt het alleen maar gedurfder.Tegelijkertijd is er de dictatuur van de eigen gedachten. Het is niet omdat e dat echt ooit gedacht heeft dat het altijd de moeite is, of dat het geen blinde vlekken cre√´ert. Het 'was oorspronkelijk bedoeld om Maia's familie uit te leggen wat het betekent om non-binair en aseksueel te zijn', zoals op de achterflap staat. Daardoor mist het een bredere scope. Maia probeert het wel, bijvoorbeeld in het gesprek met eir feministische tante, maar het is te mager. E blijft te vaak in het kleine gelijk van de eigen ervaring hangen. En ook vond ik de tekeningen wat te vlak, en bij de tekeningen van kinderen in het begin vond ik ze er ouder uitzien dan ze in werkelijkheid waren.Laat mij het positief zeggen: deze graphic novel is door wat het allemaal aanraakt een goed discussieboek om het over gender en seksualiteit te hebben. En hoort dus zeker in een bibliotheek thuis.Show more"

I think a graphic memoir was a perfect way to tell this kind of story, to really bring to visual life the struggle and turmoil of not understanding your own mind and body, and also to depict the varying ways the author changes eir look as e tries to figure out eir identity.I'm cis, but a lot of what Maia shows in this book felt familiar to me regarding my sexuality journey. From straight (or at least, the assumption of straightness that every kid had thrust upon them, especially when I was growing up) to bi to gay back to bi back to gay but then also ace...yeah, it was not exactly linear, LOL. And I think it's really important that people who are not part of the LGBTQIAP+ community gain a better understanding, as best as they can, of that process and why someone's labels and identity and pronouns may change over time. It's not that the previous ones were necessarily wrong, but they're no longer right.I did think this ended oddly abruptly and would have liked a little more at the end about eir life now. Also, there are some images in here that I found a little disturbing and some were triggering for me, and I do wish there were content notes at the beginning for pictures that included things like urination, menstrual blood, someone getting sick, etc. In a graphic work, it's hard to avoid those things because you turn the page and BOOM there's a giant drawing of a pad with blood on it. So just be cautious as you turn the pages if any of those things trigger you.I do really recommend this one, whether it's to see yourself represented or to deepen your empathy and support for someone in your life. I think it would be especially helpful to kids who are questioning their gender identity or sexuality, and struggling with societal norms around those things.Show more"

Ayer me met√≠ de lleno esta historia porque, lo admito, soy bastante ignorante cuando hablamos del colectivo y solo tengo unas nociones b√°sicas que me permiten conocer la diversidad de personas que me puedo encontrar en mi d√≠a a d√≠a. Siempre que hablo con amigas m√≠as digo lo mismo, si no se algo o no lo entiendo pregunto, porque una persona que vive una situaci√≥n es la que mejor me puede explicar lo que no conozco. Por este motivo opte por esta novela gr√°fica.Ahora bien, habla de una persona queer, pero hay que ser claros. El proceso que sigue Maia Kobabe, es el mismo que cualquier persona tiene en alg√∫n momento de su vida. Eso es lo que m√°s me ha gustado, el que es un proceso com√∫n pero el cual viene acompa√±ado de mucha informaci√≥n sobre identidad de g√©nero, sexualidad, etc. y todo de forma muy directa, con im√°genes muy espec√≠ficas sobre menstruaci√≥n, disgusto con la propia imagen corporal, dar a conocer tu identidad y conocerse a t√≠ sin lo que otra persona supone de tu vida. Hay muchas reflexiones y puntos que te hacen reflexionar, tantos que no creo acabar nunca. Mencionar las ""etiquetas"", porque si bien he visto muchas ocasiones en las que muchas personas las han usado de forma que divide y hasta rechaza a un determinado grupo o se les quita la posibilidad de opinar (cosas de las RRSS), aqu√≠ esas etiquetas no son utilizadas como forma de pertenecer a un grupo, sino que prima el saber tu identidad, quien eres y saber que existe m√°s gente similar a t√≠ y que no eres alguien peor por ello. Tambi√©n mencionar, y para resumir lo que esta historia me ha transmitido, es que la respuesta no es siempre simple, cuando vemos que Maia no se siente bien con su cuerpo, muchas personas lo relacionan a que no le gusta o no se ve bien, sin comprender que es algo m√°s profundo y que no hay una respuesta concreta que suele estar muy ""esteriotipada"".Una novela gr√°fica muy recomendable, pero tened muy claro que no es un libro informativo, es una experiencia con la que te puedes identificar y abrir un poco m√°s la mente a la variedad de personas que existen en el mundo.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50968571-britt,Gender Queer,Rating 5 out of 5,"April 14, 2022",2 likes,0,"Gender Queer had been vaguely on my radar for awhile, but the efforts of various pearl-clutchers to ban it from schools increased my motivation to read it. What I found was largely what I expected: a vulnerable, honest, and at times euphoric memoir of the author's experiences exploring eir gender and finding the nonbinary identity that fits em. Kobabe's voice is approachable and friendly, eir art solid and clean and a pleasure to look at. The section about em grappling with whether or not to come out to eir students felt powerful, and a good example of why books like this should exist. Because there might be a nonbinary kid who's scared, confused, and silent, thinking that they're broken, without any words for what they feel, and all it would take for them to start feeling more comfortable might be to see an adult they an relate to, thriving. Same for any trans kid, any queer kid.Honestly, I don't know that reading Gender Queer has equipped me to more effectively counter assertions that it and other queer lit is pornographic or grooms children, because those assertions are not made from a place of understanding the text, or even caring about the text. Those assertions are a game of telephone started by groups seeking to gain political power and continued by the gullible, small-minded, and scared. Arguing with them seems like a time-wasting trap. But I did enjoy Gender Queer a lot, which feels like a win.Rating 5 stars to balance out some of the bad faith 1-stars on here. For full disclosure, I do think that the structure gets a bit too loose toward the end, and I wish that there had been some contextualization of the concept of autoandrophilia (and its counterpart, autogynephilia) and how some people use the idea of trans people being fetishists to assert that they should not transition or have access to gender-affirming care.Show more"

I can see at once why this memoir is 1. crucial 2. controversial. Bear with me. Maia Kobabe (e/em/eir) knew from an early age e ~wasn‚Äôt like other kids~. Assigned female sex organs at birth, e was never comfortable with those nor anything to do with them. But Kobabe didn‚Äôt necessarily want to perform male either‚Ä¶or perform any gender‚Ä¶or have any sex. In eir relatively liberal, nonconformist family, this wasn‚Äôt a big deal for Kobabe‚Äôs life and development‚Äìuntil e publicly named it for what it was: gender queer and asexual. Kobabe takes the reader of this graphic novel along on the deeply personal journey of learning to speak up for what one knows is true about oneself. While Kobabe eventually finds queer communities of acceptance, e still struggles with the society pressures working against em. We are privy to it all. Kobabe delivers this story in basic, understandable language and drawings. I‚Äôve never experienced such a clear, concise description of what it means to identify as gender queer or nonbinary‚Äìor asexual. Even being totally open and accepting of all of those identities, I was surprised by how little I really KNEW about the personal histories behind them (my white woman arrogance strikes again!). I can forever only imagine how valuable it would be for a gender queer or asexual teen to read this (or have friends/family read it) and feel seen for the first time. The scientific explanation from the Fullbright scholar about how hormones around gender develop in the womb?! Should be required in life science classes these days. All of this said, yeah, I mean I get why some parents don‚Äôt want it in school libraries. There are images of sex acts, organs in full view and all (drawings, but still). But it‚Äôs really not that complicated, is it? Don‚Äôt make the book available to, like, kindergarteners at that library. Even the author emselves says uh, yeah, this book is not for kids. E says e wrote it for parents and older teens, and it didn‚Äôt feel authentic for em to leave out discussion of gender and sexuality while writing about‚Ä¶gender and sexuality. So, there you go. Taking those few images out of context to raise hell at a board of education meeting obviously does not negate the straight-up need for this kind of narrative in schools.

I learnt so much about gender expression, sexuality and pronouns and the author's experience with all of the above in this book (the author's pronouns are e/em/eir). You know a book is good when it teaches you things you never wondered about before (at least for me as a cis gender straight person), makes you question things you thought you knew and leaves you with a curiosity to know more. I loved reading about the author's childhood and upbringing... especially about eir family. They were such kind, supportive and lovely people. There's a part towards the end of the book that I really loved, where the author works as a teacher who teaches comics for junior high students. And e talk about eir difficulties with sharing eir pronouns with the students. E fear that it may be considered ""too political"" in a classroom and that e might get fired... but then e are reminded of eir own experience with gender confusion at roughly the same age as the children e teach... and how ultimately it's important that these discussions be had in the classroom because these kids deserve to know that they're not alone.

Kobabe says some things that are incredibly resonant wrt gender and doesn't shy away from the messiness of figuring out oneself wrt gender and sexuality. The tone, pacing, and illustration style reminds me a lot of ""Fun Home"". It's no coincidence that a lot of queer comic artists take inspiration from Alison Bechdel. My main critiques are small-ish: 1) e brought up Harry Potter without, later on, critiquing JKR. Since Kobabe is a non-binary person who aligns at least somewhat with the trans community, and given the publication date of the book, this raised an eyebrow. 2) Similarly, e cited how reading some work about ""male vs female brains"" helped em understand how e may be ""wired differently"" (for lack of a better way to say it), but I imagine such literature could be incredibly damaging and trans-exclusionary in the wrong hands. E obviously is self-aware enough to write this thoughtful memoir, so both of these inclusions felt strange. This work is often compared to ""X-gender"" vol 1, and I'd have to say they both have their strengths, and I like both of these memoirs. At times ""Gender queer"" is a bit too tender for my taste, but at the same time the tenderness is often what makes it resonate. ""X-gender"" comes on strong with angry, raunchy, and sometimes problematic takes, but this ultimately is a person's story of themself, and the in-your-face bawdiness of it is what I like about it so much. Turns out, people are complicated! It helps to read more and more stories of different kinds of people. Show more"

This graphic memoir of the author‚Äôs journey toward identifying as non-binary and asexual has been the subject of conservative hand-wringing based on asinine claims that it‚Äôs child pornography. Although there are a couple of panels depicting sexual experiences or fantasies, they are *not* in there to titillate or arouse (aka they are *not* pornographic) and are in the larger context of Kobabe‚Äôs evolution in figuring out eir gender identity. This is a coming-of-age memoir from a person whose experiences we don‚Äôt see highlighted often. I can see this helping a lot of people who don‚Äôt have a name for the feelings they have around their gender (feelings that they would have regardless of whether they read Kobabe‚Äôs memoir). Increasing cultural representation of LGBTQ+ people doesn‚Äôt make people queer.

(The author, Maia Kobabe uses  e/em/eir pronouns)I was so excited to finally see some nonbinary/asexual representation! Gender Queer does a great job of exploring how we see ourselves vs how the world sees us. Kobabe struggles with not exactly wanting to be a boy, but knowing that e's not a girl. The visual representation of fluidity of gender and how e sees eirself is stunning and evocative. The depiction of Kobabe being mounted like a butter fly after em first pap smear blows me away and I could not stop starring at it. When e gets uncomfortable and could be describing as disassociating, the pages grow fuzzy and unaligned. Eir sister, Phoebe did an incredible job on the color.E does not shy away from being open in this book about eir body, which is surprising considering the repeated assertions that e did not feel comfortable writing about any of that. Which I think goes to show, all the healing that can be done when one truly finds themselves.Of course, some of the fanfiction mentioned can turn off a reader, and especially the references to Harry Potter.

I am old, 80 years, spent most of my life in education, have had people come out to me, hit on me (both genders), have friends who are straight and gay, my son is gay. So, I thought I knew a lot about gender concerns. I was wrong. This autobiography/memoir gives info on a young person who thinks she is he or he is she. They were atrracted to both sexes from teen years onward. They went to school and was rejected by a group of boys because she was not a boy. So Maia began thinking about the gender presentation she was making. They were boys clothes, had long hair like many boys at that time. throughout the book, Maia reminds me that gender is a cultural word. And we go through a lot of years with Maia, struggling with her varied sexual desires. This is just a great book and I urge every parent to get this book for his or her teen or young adult. But read it first, learn what young people are going through as far as gender or sexual identity. When I finish this review, I am going to order a copy for my 14 year old nephew.

I very much enjoyed this quick-to-read graphic.To be sure, ""Gender Queer"" is a memoir that will make some people uncomfortable: mensuration is discussed and visually depicted, sex - partnered and solo - is discussed and depicted, gender identity is explored way beyond the binary, LGBTQIA people exist without apology, gynecological exams happen, pronouns are used and re-considered. Of course, if one wants to see a loving, accepting family and a depiction of the power of reading, that's in here too. But if clutching pearls is your go-to, this has plenty of reasons to be, ""Shocked! Shocked I say."" Of course, Kobabe lives a life that was often uncomfortable [this is understatement, for dramatic effect], and isn't memoir about sharing the in-obvious but important moments of a life? The turning points? The normal things that happen discordantly? Turning the particular, personal challenges into an affecting story of growing up is important to read, as Kobabe covers many of the questions anyone might have about non-binary life. I suspect that's really what all the fuss is about: ""Gender Queer"" humanizes lots of people, making it hard to cast them as a dangerous horde.Show more"

Although my experience with femininity isn't the same, I felt like I could understand where the author was coming from; eir feelings of fear, discomfort, and uncertainty were portrayed to perfection. The impostor syndrome about queerness and coming out was also done amazingly: how to tell people, is it worth it, not wanting to burden others.¬†And the idea of misogyny affecting nonbinarism is something I've worried about myself while questioning gender as well.

Within the queer community, a lot of it is deeply relatable.

That's how you make empathetic people, you bozos.I was very interested in Maia's pronoun journey (e/em/eir) and how much of an internal struggle it is for em to correct people/family/friends and insist that they incorporate these strange words they've never used before.

A future where we can grow up feeling supported, advocating for ourselves and one another.I have to mention that there is a part in the book where Patricia Churchland's work is mentioned, and this is where the author lost me. I think the ideas of Patricia Churchland require more examination. It can be dangerous to listen to people who are philosophers explaining neuroscience in a way to validate their ideas. Even though I don't agree with the ideas Churchland presents (the claim of a specifically female or male brain) I understand the sense of validation this can bring to a person looking for answers to why they feel like they are different, and that's what I'll take away from it.I would have also liked to hear more of a dive into misogyny relating to the authors experience, but I also don't think it's up for me to dictate someone's artistic expression.

It is a gentle, honest and authentic look at one person's memoir and experience with sexuality and gender identity.

Maia Kobabe painted an impeccable picture of eir journey to understanding what gender means to em. As someone who is a trans woman, I've only experienced my own gender-related struggles and what it took for me to understand I was meant to be a girl all along, so being able to gain some deeper insight into the experience of someone who is non-binary was beyond enlightening and educational for me.

I gained insight and perspective. So honest and bravely told. And yet, this is the book people want banned??? Can't you just choose not to read it? Its so informative. And I can't imagine how reaffirming and comforting it would be to others, to see themselves reflected in a book. We should all have books accessible to us that we can see ourselves reflected in, ESPECIALLY if we are marginalized or a minority. Would it be possible to make another edition of this book appropriate for younger kids, like in middle school? Some of them might not be ready for all of this content. But there's so much in here that could be a life-saver for a young person struggling with their identity in a way similar to what Kobabe went through.Be sure to read the deluxe edition, printed this year. There's a forward by Stevenson that I have told many people about. I'd like to include 2 quotes for it here:""Seeing yourself in the world, knowing that you're not alone, that you could actually have a future as yourself - it's lifesaving. My parents worked hard to make sure I couldn't find those positive portrayals. But that censorship didn't make me not queer. What it did do was make me afraid, lonely, and filled with self-loathing"".""...Parents in Texas and other states have pushed to have Gender Queer banned from school libraries. It's not enough for them to rigorously restrict what their own children read, as my parents did; they insist that they have the right to make that choice for everyone. I understand - more, I think, than they think I do - why they want this. It's a last, desperate attempt to hammer an infinitely complex world into a small, unthreatening shape...""Show more"

A perfect reason to pick up a book! Honestly, I kind of get why it's banned. This book is super insightful and would be incredibly helpful for teenagers and adults who are confused about their gender. The bigots do not want happy and thriving queer teenagers. They would rather cling onto their beliefs for the sake of tradition and their own narrow views of the world. Ok, rant over. Normally, I wouldn't be interested in this book because I prefer fantasy and romance. However, it was a quick and thought-provoking read. Being a cisgender straight woman, I learned a lot about what it could feel like to be in a body that doesn't fully match who I am.

Right away this author lets you know that this is a very personal and vulnerable work that they've (eir've? - pronouns are e/em/eir - let me know!) shared and with recent attempts at censorship I can imagine the complex feelings about this published work - although, I am happy to have read it and it gave me more insight to my own journey and subjects that don't really come up. (I'm a shy they/them/their) I'm really happy to have read this. From being in the process of expressing pronouns, to even the subjects of asexuality (? or maybe general disinterest in own body), to addressing health concerns that impact in a big way because it feels like it makes a conclusion about yourself.I have experience the gender roles and constrictions as we get older - especially middle school (and high school) This was some kinda hell. I also generally have a disinterest of normie sexual things because I need a strong connection first with the person, or I feel like i'm intruding?? (Although, I enjoy Aesthetics of people) I'm lucky to have a partner that has been really patient and we have that connection. I generally don't even like addressing my parts, so similarly I skipped the pap for YEARS because I wasn't ready to address that I have these parts...idk I decided I had to do it after my aunt died of cancer, I skipped it again that year, but the next year I did it because I had 2x cancer scares. There was more in the book that I learned more about Maia's perspective and what eir growing up wants/wishes were and I thought that was really interesting.

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91373345-gabriel-h,Gender Queer,Rating 3 out of 5,"October 12, 2023",2 likes,0,"3.5. An interesting reading experience; Kobabe is someone whose gender resembles my own in some ways, especially at first glance/to strangers, and the points of overlap and the stronger points of divergence made certain parts of this hit harder and others, conversely, sort of slide off of me. But more than my personal gender-related reading experience, this book didn't feel quite finished; there were many moments that felt like the author uncovered something big and potentially difficult, and instead of exploring it, e left it there and moved on. I didn't need every nuance exhaustively explored on the page, but I want them to feel as if the author has explored them somewhere, and brought that understanding back to the work. On the other hand, I suspect that part of why conservatives are incredibly panicked about this book is because it is an approachable, easy read that doesn't dive as deeply or messily into the teeming world of gender and sexuality as it could--it's a solid starting point. That has value.Show more"

There are a few graphic sex scenes, but beyond that, this is a very intimate and calm book of self-discovery. It's hesitant and, narrative-wise, feels a bit incomplete. But Kobabe's grappling with gender and personal identity is also very beautiful and honest. It's a meaningful book and I can both see why it's at the center of some of the bans -- graphic novels that depict sex scenes are different, to me, than textual novels that depict sex scenes (but how much are they different? I am still adrift on that one) -- and, as a parent, I can see how school libraries might hesitate to carry the text, even without the controversy. I almost wish that the graphic novel didn't have those scenes, because the rest of the story is, as I mentioned, so thoughtful and truthful, and very worth reading for anyone who either has questions about gender, being nonbinary, or finding the courage to just be yourself.

While, yes, there is some (semi) graphic material I dont think it is as bad as many people are saying. Believe me, kids are seeing A LOT worse on the internet. I personally dont see the reason to ban it, but I'm also not afraid of kids having discussions to better understand sexuality and gender identity. Kids/adolescents deal with ""sexual"" topics a lot more than adults think they do. Anyways, I found the graphic novel interesting and at times applicable (especially about asexuality and the lack of desire for kids). However, I'm not a huge fan of the art style (but that is ultimately a minor thing). I also felt like the story did meander at times, and I sometimes wanted more (but I'm not sure in what way). I'm choosing not to rate the book because I feel like it's not my place to do so. Many people will love and connect deeply with this story (conversely, many people will hate it too).

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4141624-lenny,Gender Queer,Rating 5 out of 5,"October 17, 2019",2 likes,0,"Maia Kobabe, who uses e/em/eir pronouns, shares eir personal journey as an asexual and nonbinary person. Growing up in a time that didn‚Äôt have the language, resources, or community of a genderqueer movement that exists today, Maia had to struggle on eir own to understand eir gender, dating, pronouns and feeling at home in eir body.Maia‚Äôs account of eir life story is raw and boldly honest, explaining how e went through several stages of self discovery and understanding, finally embracing a gender identity and sexuality that fit for em ‚Äì and then the stages of asking others to accept em as well. Eir honesty and sometimes self deprecating amusement of eir past helps lighten the pervasive struggle and confusion e endured on a daily basis. E shares to a degree that many of us might not be comfortable exposing to the masses, regardless of our gender identity or sexuality, but e does so to help educate others about the experience of being genderqueer in a society rooted in a binary, even though acceptance of multiple genders exist across many cultures and religions throughout history. (Maia knew e was stepping into the limelight, welcoming questions with an adorable ‚ÄúI did volunteer for this‚Äù in an interview.)As Maia chronicles eir childhood through becoming an adult, e shares eir confusion regarding dating and relationships (e first identifies as bisexual), fantasies that e later could define as kinks, whether e is transgender or something else, and the overall erasure of nonbinary folks in American society. This is so important for those who might assume being asexual means no relationship with sex at all. Similarly, Maia honestly portrays eir family as open, honest and understanding, but is also unflinching about eir family‚Äôs struggle to accept em at times.The most devastating part of the book for me was Maia‚Äôs recounting of eir traumatizing appointments with the gynecologist, a searing look into how the medical world was (ans probably still is) woefully ill equipped to be compassionate and understanding towards genderqueer folks. These pages took my breath away and brought me to tears. Even though Maia is able to better express emself on the second visit, the appointment is still awful and dehumanizing.But along with eir overall journey, Maia also shares eir love of slash fan fiction, fantasy books and becoming an artist. Gender and sexuality are, of course, formative to all of our identities, but Maia is sure to include eir whole sense of self. Maia was consistently surrounded by meaningful friendships and a supportive family, particularly Maia‚Äôs (also queer!) sister Phoebe who helps eir with an underwear issue.Maia‚Äôs art feels simple but realistic enough to look rooted in reality. The layouts range from the standard nine-panel progression to beautiful and creative layouts as well as one page spreads. E uses block lettering that feels like handwriting that sometimes loops into cursive during important moments. Maia grew up on a 120 acre property in Northern California, and e often uses metaphors rooted in nature to explain eir struggles. The palette is mostly colorful and bright with lots of greens and yellows.This book helps cis and non-asexual folks like myself start to understand how pervasive, destructive and literally painful the gender binary is to folks who don‚Äôt fit in that binary (which, thanks to my privilege, is more everywhere than I ever realized, and must be destroyed immediately). How it affects not just dating and romantic relationships, as some might assume, but every moment of one‚Äôs life, living in one‚Äôs body, using and hearing pronouns that don‚Äôt fit one‚Äôs sense of self. And I can‚Äôt even imagine how much Maia‚Äôs honest story means to genderqueer folks, who may have felt just as alone and confused as Maia before picking up eir book. Being seen and not feeling alone is powerful, as all minorities will attest to ‚Äì and Maia also experiences emself.Non-binary pronouns are still relatively new (particularly those outside they/them/their), Maia‚Äôs memoir is an important guide for non-genderqueer and/or non-asexual folks on how to empathize and be better allies, even if you‚Äôre queer; for parents who want to be sensitive to providing their children spaces to explore their gender; for medical professionals; and for all genderqueer folks to feel seen and heard.PS - I did my best to use the Spivak pronouns but it's new to me - my apologies if I used incorrect pronouns, please let me know in the comments if I did!This review and more on my blog, Reading Art!

Genderqueer levert hier zeker een bijdrage aan, maar wat dit boek bijzonderder maakt dan anderen is het feit dat het een persoonlijk verhaal is. Eerlijk gezegd vind ik het daarom ook lastiger om een recensie over dit boek te schrijven: het voelt namelijk alsof ik kritiek uit op iemands leven, en dat is met deze recensie zeer zeker niet mijn bedoeling.Genderqueer is een graphic novel dat in eerste instantie is ontwikkeld door Maia Kobabe om uitleg aan dierbaren te kunnen geven over hoe Kobabe de zoektocht naar identiteit heeft ervaren. Het is hierdoor een heel persoonlijk, maar waarschijnlijk voor velen ook een herkenbaar verhaal. In die zin raad ik het boek zeker aan, daarbij is het simpelweg interessant om te lezen over een leven die heel anders is dan dat van jezelf. Er zijn wel enkele punten aan te merken. Zo heb ik regelmatig het gevoel dat niet alles gedeeld wordt. Begrijp me niet verkeerd: Kobabe bepaald natuurlijk zelf welke onderdelen meer aandacht krijgen, het is immers een persoonlijk verhaal, maar toch had ik regelmatig het gevoel ‚Äò iets te missen‚Äô. Een voorbeeld daarvan is het gesprek dat het karakter voert met een grootouder die niet begrijpt wat non-binair zijn inhoudt. Dit wordt vrij summier beschreven, terwijl ik nieuwsgierig raakte naar hoe Kobabe dit heeft ervaren, dit gesprek heeft voortgezet/ afgerond en hoe dit uiteindelijk is ‚Äòopgelost‚Äô.Kobabe heeft dit boek zowel geschreven als ge√Øllustreerd. De schrijfstijl is over het algemeen toegankelijk en goed te volgen en de illustraties zijn ansich prima, maar er zitten ook wat meer expliciete en wat gevoelige beelden tussen, die wellicht niet voor iedereen geschikt zijn. Met name omdat het gaat om een Young Adult graphic novel vind ik dat dit anders had gekunt.Dan een opmerking die geen invloed heeft op de waardering van het boek, maar wat ik w√©l graag uitgesproken wil hebben: Er zit een Harry Potter verwijzing in. Wat ik daar bijzonder aan vind, is dat J.K. Rowling gecancelled wordt en sommige bloggers daarin z√≥ ver gaan, dat ze stoppen met het lezen van een boek zodra ze ook maar √©√©n Harry Potter verwijzing zien. Nu zie ik enkele bloggers, die dit normaliter doen, dit boek alsnog vijf sterren geven en hier geen woord aan vuil maken. Ik vind dit opmerkelijk: als je normaliter een boek al weglegt vanwege √©√©n Harry Potter vermelding, is het toch ook het vermelden waard? Of wordt het gedoogd omdat het een autobiografie is door een non-binair persoon?‚Ä¶Desalniettemin: Genderqueer is een aanrader voor eenieder die meer wil lezen over non-binair zijn of wellicht op zoek is naar een herkenbaar verhaal. Vergeet niet dat het hier om een verhaal gaat van √©√©n persoon: elke non-binair kan deze zoektocht weer anders ervaren üôÇShow more"

Just like everyone, Maia's life is unique (but maybe more unique than many) and there is no final ""now I know my life 100%"" moment.Maia writes with thoughtfulness and curiosity but also explores eir hesitations, discomforts and confusion around gender. E offers¬†a very personal story but that's just why it should be shared and available more broadly.

I found it very interesting to learn of the perspective of Maia and the feelings that come with different stages of life from young child to 20something). The book was well done and informative based on the experiences Maia has had and I learned a few things. The reviews are mixed on this - I am mostly positive as my opinion is this book could be helpful for someone that is feeling unsure of their life/sexuality/emotions.

Maia Kobabe spent most of eir childhood feeling like e didn't belong and wasn't in tune with the rest of the world Eir memoir covers eir childhood up to young adulthood, and the different gender labels and sexualities that e explored before finding something that was comfortable for eir. I have had this book on my to-read shelf for awhile, and finally picked it up after all the news of challenges, especially some close to home. And it is a shame because this is such a wonderful, relatable, and vulnerable memoir. Maia shares eir experiences in an honest and candid way. Even if you aren't genderqueer (I am not), there is a lot in eir experiences that is relatable for anyone who has felt like they don't belong or fit in. The art is a great complement to Maia's story and brings eir feelings and experiences to life. Yes, the book does include some sexual situations and it is those that all the calls for banning stem from. All I will say about those is that they do fit in with the context of the story. They are not drawn in such a way to be titillating, but rather to show Maia's story and figuring out eir sexuality. And they are very brief scenes (less than a page). There is also some nudity in a medical setting, but again that exists to show Maia's feelings of vulnerability in that moment not to be provocative. If those sound like things you do not want to encounter while reading, then by all means don't, but also don't try to take the book away from those who do want to read it or find it helpful. This is a wonderful coming-of-age memoir and I appreciate Maia sharing eir story. I would highly recommend this to those wanting to learn more about the genderqueer experience (while acknowledging that this is one person's experience and does not represent the entire spectrum). If you enjoy memoirs, then I would highly recommend adding this one to your TBR. 2022 Read Harder Challenge: Read a memoir written by someone who is trans or nonbinaryCW: cancer, depression, gore (blood), medical procedures, misgendering, sexual content (one detailed scene), swearing (some strong language)Show more"
